# Myocardial Revascularization with Percutaneous Devices

James M. Wilson • James T. Willerson

At its height, the success of surgical coronary revascularization spurred improvement in catheter-based technology first for imaging quality, and later for attempted therapy. In 1974, Andreas Gruentzig completed the development of a double-lumen balloon catheter that was miniaturized for use in coronary arteries. Soon afterward, techniques for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) expanded as technical breakthroughs were applied to subselective catheters, devices, guidewires, balloon materials, coronary stents, and circulatory support. Currently, trial evidence attests that percutaneous therapy is useful as a treatment in patients with poorly controlled angina whose anatomy does not imply a survival benefit from revascularization, and for emergency revascularization during ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI). Surgical and percutaneous revascularization, however, cannot be considered equivalent.1

#### **BALLOON ANGIOPLASTY**

## **Principles**

In the early balloon angioplasty era, several technical limitations restricted the use of percutaneous techniques to low-risk patients with proximal, discrete coronary artery stenoses, and procedural outcomes lacked predictability. As advances in tools and techniques were developed, higherrisk patients became candidates for percutaneous therapy. Over time, several principles for safety and success were recognized (Table 19-1).

#### Tools

#### **GUIDING CATHETERS**

Guiding catheters differ from diagnostic catheters in that a wire braid supports a thin catheter wall, allowing for a larger central lumen and providing enough rigidity to support the advance of subselective catheters to the distal regions of the coronary bed. The anatomy of the ascending aorta and the origin of the treated coronary artery determine which shape of guiding catheter will provide the most secure positioning (Fig. 19-1). The choice of guiding catheter often is the deciding factor for success when the arterial anatomy is

challenging or when complications increase procedural difficulty. Guiding-catheter manipulation is a common cause of procedural complications that necessitate the urgent transition to coronary artery bypass surgery.

A recent innovation in guiding catheter technology is the Guideliner<sup>®</sup>. The Guideliner is a device for subselective

intubation of the coronary artery branches or saphenous vein grafts; its design borrows from that of the original Palmaz-Schatz stent platform. Subselective delivery of a catheter at or beyond the origin of a lesion substantially increases the probability of successful stent delivery. Most useful in delivering stents to the obtuse marginal saphenous vein graft, the Guideliner has been used for almost every difficult anatomic variant.<sup>2</sup>

#### **GUIDEWIRES**

When the guiding catheter's position remains secure, the guidewire allows control of the distal vessel. Different wires vary in stiffness, coating, diameter, and design of the distal steering tip. For most procedures, the chosen wire is a 190- to 300-cm monofilament that is 0.0254 to 0.0356 cm in diameter, with either a graded tapering segment welded to the tip

or a gradual taper of the monofilament. The central wire core at the tip is "plastic," or malleable, and may be shaped by the operator. In many wire designs, a wire coil wrapped around the central filament projects a blunter, less traumatic tip to the vessel that it must traverse. Generally, the softest tip is the safest tip. However, in certain situations, such as treatment of a chronic total occlusion, a stiffer wire tip with a bonded, hydrophilic coating, rather than the wire coil, is frequently most effective. Although using these stiffer, "slicker" wires increases the likelihood of crossing the lesion successfully, the wires also increase the risk of complications, such as the creation of a subintimal wire course, the induction of dissection, or the perforation of the vessel (Fig. 19-2).

#### TOOLS FOR LUMEN EXPANSION

Most subselective devices for coronary artery manipulation are balloon inflation catheters or something similar. Balloon catheter designs vary in the placement of the proximal opening of the central lumen. The "on the wire" design has a central lumen that extends the length of the catheter. This design affords the best trackability and capability for maneuvering through difficult anatomy, but it requires an assistant to manipulate the wire during device advance. The "monorail" design has a central lumen, extending only through the distal balloon shaft of the catheter. The remaining catheter shaft communicates only with the balloon lumen. This design,

**FIGURE 19-2** Support for subselective device introduction into the coronary vessels is determined primarily by the shape of the guiding catheter in relation to the anatomy of the ascending aorta and the origin of the left main coronary artery. Shown graphically, advance of the device forces the catheter backward. This movement is opposed by the alignment of the catheter with the coronary artery and by friction developing through contact between the primary curve of the catheter and the opposing wall of the aorta. (Reproduced with permission from Ikari Y, Nagaoka M, Kim JY, et al: The physics of guiding catheters for the left coronary artery in transfemoral and transradial interventions, *J Invasive Cardiol*. 2005 Dec;17(12):636-641.)

though less trackable, allows the procedure to be performed without the need for an assistant.

Properties of the angioplasty balloon include compliance, maximally tolerated pressure, profile, and friction coefficient. Compliance, or growth under pressure, and maximally tolerated pressure are a function of balloon wall thickness and material. Compliance is divided into three categories depending on the growth of the balloon under pressure: noncompliant, semicompliant, and compliant. The thin-walled, compliant balloon has the lowest deflated profile, which allows the device to pass through the most severely occluded vessels. However, the balloon may not expand uniformly or lengthen when exposed to high pressures, such as pressures in excess of 20 atm (15,200 mm Hg), which are required to dilate hard and heavily calcified stenoses or stents. A variety of balloon coatings may be used to reduce the friction coefficient or protect the lumen from abrasion (eg, from passing a stent).

#### ANTITHROMBOTIC THERAPY

During an angioplasty procedure, blood may stagnate in the guiding catheter or near the treated lesion when a wire or

device is placed within the lumen of the target lesion. In addition, metallic components of the guidewire or other devices attract fibrinogen, thus stimulating thrombosis. Therefore, a thrombus may form easily unless prevented with intense anticoagulation therapy (Table 19-2).3 Most angioplasty procedures are performed with unfractionated heparin (UFH) titrated to an activated clotting time (ACT) value of more than 300 seconds.<sup>4</sup> Alternative anticoagulants, such as lowmolecular-weight heparins and direct antithrombin antagonists, may be used.5-9 Direct thrombin inhibitors may be associated with reduced risk for major bleeding complications but are not reversible in the event that emergency surgical referral is needed.<sup>10</sup> Antiplatelet therapy also reduces the risk of thrombosis at the treated lesion. In addition to aspirin and thienopyridines, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GP IIb/IIIa) complex inhibitors may be administered in specific circumstances. The GP IIb/IIIa complex inhibitors are unique in their ability to impair platelet-platelet aggregation, regardless of the type or intensity of stimulus. Anticoagulation is titrated to a lower intensity (an ACT of 200-250 seconds) when GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors are used.

#### Mechanisms

Balloon angioplasty transmits increased intraluminal pressures circumferentially to the rigid intimal surface of the diseased vessel. Because atherosclerotic lesions typically are heterogeneous in their circumferential distribution and physical characteristics, the nondiseased or less diseased wall may be overstretched during balloon inflation. In most instances, the lesion segment with the greatest structural integrity is a focal point for applied stress. Adjacent regions of the vascular wall can shift, and the diseased, inelastic intima can fracture. Although this mechanism allows balloon expansion and an increase in luminal diameter, extension of the fracture into the intima-media border creates a dissection plane, the growth of which is determined by the mechanical characteristics of the lesion and the amount of force applied. If growth of the dissection plane results in significant displacement of the diseased intima, the vessel will close. This event, termed abrupt or acute occlusion, complicates about 10% of balloon angioplasty procedures. Overstretching the minimally diseased or nondiseased wall without causing plaque fracture typically results in early recoil of the treated lesion to its original state.

After balloon deflation, a small amount of thrombus accumulates, providing the stimulus and framework for colonization by inflammatory cells and myofibroblasts and the eventual, local synthesis of temporary (intimal hyperplasia) and permanent (collagen-rich) connective tissue. In addition, mechanical injury to the media and adventitia results in scar formation. The scar's contracture may reduce vessel cross-sectional area—a phenomenon termed *negative remodeling*. During vascular healing, the encroaching intimal hyperplasia that peaks in volume at about 3 months, combined with negative remodeling, results in restenosis after 40 to 50% of balloon angioplasty procedures. <sup>13-15</sup>

#### Outcomes

In approximately 2 to 10% of balloon angioplasty procedures, intimal dissection, thrombosis, and perhaps medial smooth muscle spasm combine to produce abrupt closure. 16,17 Abrupt closure may be treated successfully with repeat balloon inflation but is treated more commonly with stent implantation.<sup>18</sup> The specter of abrupt closure and MI or emergency bypass surgery and its complications historically has limited the application of balloon angioplasty.

In patients with stable angina, mortality from balloon angioplasty procedures is 1% at 1 month. 19 About half of the deaths are the result of a procedural complication, and most are related to low cardiac output (Table 19-3).<sup>20</sup> Although the incidence of restenosis (>50% diameter stenosis during follow-up) is 40 to 50% within 6 to 9 months of a PTCA procedure, 13,15,21 only 25% of patients report recurrent angina that warrants further investigation.<sup>22</sup> Patients with restenosis have an increased risk of MI and needing coronary artery bypass surgery.<sup>23</sup>

#### **DEVICE-ASSISTED ANGIOPLASTY**

#### **Stents**

The two failure modes of balloon angioplasty—abrupt closure and restenosis—have stimulated the development of a myriad of devices, all intended to reduce procedure-related risk, the risk of restenosis, or both. Only coronary stenting has been shown to be advantageous over balloon angioplasty alone, except in severely calcified lesions (Table 19-4). There are numerous coronary stent designs, but the majority of those in current use consist of a cylinder that is made from stainless steel (or an alloy, such as cobalt chromium) and that has been "carved," creating a so-called slotted-tube design. Stent expansion creates a series of interlocking cells, resembling a cylindrical mesh-work (Fig. 19-3). Stents are thus deformable, but when expanded, they maintain sufficient rigidity to act as scaffolding after the angioplasty balloon is deflated. Intimal disruption is contained and far less likely to propagate and occlude the treated vessel. In addition, the rigid framework left behind becomes part of the vessel wall, addressing the issue of remodeling, which is one of the mechanisms of restenosis.

Stents allow safe expansion of the vessel beyond that typically achieved with PTCA at the time of balloon expansion;

however, stent use increases the thrombotic and inflammatory responses of the vessel wall. The increased injury and a foreign-body response to stent struts result in a more intense and prolonged local inflammatory response.<sup>24</sup> Consequently, stent placement paradoxically exacerbates intimal hyperplasia. 25,26 If one uses the late (6 or 9 months) loss in lumen diameter after stent implantation as a measure of intimal hyperplasia, even the most modern stent designs fall within a range of about 0.8 mm—more than twice the loss incurred after PTCA (0.32 mm). As a result, with regard to restenosis after angioplasty, the impact of stenting for percutaneous coronary revascularization (PCR) is rather small in comparison with that of PTCA.<sup>25,26</sup> Intimal hyperplasia and restenosis risk are primarily functions of the size of the treated lumen on completion of the procedure, the length of the treated lesion, and the presence of unstable angina, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus (Table 19-5).<sup>27-29</sup> Long-term follow-up studies indicate that a stent that does not reocclude during the first 6 to 9 months after implantation is not subject to late, rapid disease progression.<sup>30-34</sup>

By reducing the likelihood of abrupt closure requiring emergency coronary artery bypass surgery and of restenosis, stent-assisted angioplasty is more effective than routine balloon angioplasty for virtually any type of coronary artery lesion. Registry data describe a risk for emergency surgery of only 0.3 to 1.1% and a procedural mortality of less than 1%.35-38 The likelihood of procedural complications may be estimated on the basis of lesion characteristics (Table 19-6).<sup>39</sup> Depending on lesion characteristics and the number of lesions treated, after 1 year, 5 to 10% of patients require coronary artery bypass surgery, and 15 to 20% undergo a second percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure. 40-43 After 5 years, 10 to 15% of patients require another revascularization procedure because of the development of severe stenosis at an untreated site.<sup>34</sup> Diabetes increases the risk for adverse outcomes by increasing the risk of restenosis and disease progression at untreated sites.

As noted previously in the description of the guidewire, iron components of stent struts attract fibrinogen and provide a site for platelet attachment and thrombosis. The increased risk of thrombosis at the treated site persists until endothelialization is complete. As a result, more intense antithrombotic therapy is required during the procedure and for up to 1 year afterward. 44,45

#### Stenting

**FIGURE 19-3** The coronary stent is a metallic "meshwork" that increases its rigidity when cold worked by balloon expansion. Buttressing of the vascular wall, propagation of dissection, and early vascular recoil are reduced significantly. (Used with permission from Texas Heart Institute, www.texasheart.org.)

Stents may be used as a drug-delivery system. However, rather than simply applying a drug to the stent's surface from which it will dissipate quickly, drug delivery is controlled by using a surface polymer or by altering the design or the material used to construct the stent. 46 This drug-delivery device, called a *drug-eluting stent* (DES), allows the drug to be applied at high concentrations at the site of interest and reduces the probability of systemic toxicity.

DESs reduce the primary determinant of restenosis by 50 to 100%, as determined by measuring late lumen loss after angioplasty (Fig. 19-4). Studies that examined the efficacy of the DES resulted in the introduction of new nomenclature for the follow-up endpoints. The most useful follow-up endpoint is termed *target vessel failure* (TVF), signified by cardiac death, MI, or repeat

revascularization of the treated vessel. One year after the procedure, the risk of TVF is reduced from 19.4 to 21% with a baremetal stent (BMS) to 8.8 to 10% with a DES.  $^{40,43,47}$ 

Reduced rates of repeat intervention after DES placement have been reported for every type of lesion studied except bifurcation lesions, for which the risk of restenosis remains significant, and the risk of potentially fatal early thrombosis is as high as 3.5% (Table 19-7). 40,43,48-66 Although the use of a DES reduces the rate of failure of long-term treatment and of repeat

procedures, this reduction does not translate to a reduced risk of procedure-related complications. <sup>67</sup> In addition, incomplete healing, a response to the eluting polymer, or both confer an increased risk of stent thrombosis that extends beyond 1 year. <sup>68</sup> As a result, after intervention with a first-generation DES or in a patient with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), dual antiplatelet therapy should be continued for at least 1 year in all patients and indefinitely in patients with complex lesions. Newer-generation DESs allow for more rapid reendothelialization and a slight increase in late loss without increasing the risk of in-stent restenosis. As a result, the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy can safely be reduced to less than a year. For clinically stable patients, only 6 months of dual therapy is required, which increases the number of patients who may safely receive a DES while facing the prospect of noncardiac surgery in the near future. <sup>69</sup>

#### Other Devices

#### PERFUSION BALLOONS

Before coronary stents came into routine use, abrupt closure owing to dissection could be treated with repeat balloon inflation and, if that was unsuccessful, with coronary artery bypass surgery. Prolonged balloon inflation generally was necessary for successfully restoring patency, but in the event of failure, transport for emergency surgery often was accompanied by severe ischemia of the treated territory. As a result, balloon catheters with a short third-lumen opening just proximal and distal to the balloon were developed. These catheters, or "perfusion balloons," allowed prolonged balloon inflation with far less ischemia and could be used to ameliorate ischemia during transport for surgery after an unsuccessful procedure. Since the introduction of the coronary stent, the use of perfusion balloons has become rare.

#### **ATHERECTOMY**

When the concept of reducing the bulk of the obstructing atheroma was first introduced, it was quite attractive.

The idea was to reduce vessel wall thickness, or "debulk," allowing balloon expansion at a lower pressure. Theoretically, with less force applied for lumen expansion, the likelihood of abrupt closure would be reduced, as would the degree of arterial injury at the time of treatment. Several devices used for debulking have been developed and studied, including directional coronary atherectomy, percutaneous transluminal rotational ablation, and laser ablation. Unfortunately, when subjected to rigorous examination, debulking devices were found to provide no substantial advantage over plain balloon angioplasty in achieving procedural success or avoiding restenosis. 70-73 Although each device has acquired a specific niche (see Table 19-4), their routine use is generally associated with an increased risk of procedural complications, including perforation and MI. 73-75

Rotational atherectomy requires additional discussion because unlike the other types of atherectomy, it is still commonly used. The Rotablator (Boston Scientific Corporation, Natick, MA) is an olive-shaped device coated with diamond chips that is attached to an electrical motor that can rotate the device at high speeds. The device is designed to abrade a rigid atherosclerotic intima, creating microemboli that are small enough to pass through the coronary microcirculation without incident. It is also useful as an initial treatment method for very rigid, heavily calcified lesions. However, the concept of rotational atherectomy is not without shortcomings. Microembolization is likely to exacerbate ischemia and therefore is contraindicated when there are thrombotic lesions, if there is impaired microcirculatory flow associated with a recent MI, or if the treated vessel is the last remaining patent vessel. Use of this device is also associated with an increased risk of perforation in highly angulated lesions. Another recently developed form of atherectomy is the single-bladed rotational atherectomy device used for "orbital" atherectomy. This treatment's place in the PCI armamentarium has not yet been fully determined.<sup>76</sup>

#### **ASPIRATION DEVICES**

Several coronary aspiration devices are available to reduce the risk of distal embolization and to diminish the local concentration of prothrombotic and vasoactive substances. These devices range from a simple end-hole catheter attached to a syringe to a complex suction catheter with or without an associated mechanical disrupter. These devices forcibly extract components of the thrombus or atheroma.<sup>77</sup> Their use may improve flow after the treatment of thrombus-laden lesions or saphenous vein grafts (Fig. 19-5).<sup>78</sup>

#### EMBOLIC PROTECTION DEVICES

During balloon angioplasty, mechanical dissolution of thrombus (if any is present) may result in macroembolization and distal vessel occlusion. The high-pressure manipulation of an atheromatous lesion also may free cholesterol crystals and other components of the lesion, resulting in distal microembolization, thrombosis, and slow- or no-reflow phenomenon.

**FIGURE 19-5** In a patient with ongoing inferior myocardial infarction, the right coronary artery is occluded by thrombus (A). After passage of a guidewire followed by aspiration at the site of occlusion, thrombus is withdrawn, restoring antegrade blood flow (B). A stent then is placed at the site of the culprit lesion to complete the procedure (C).

Several devices have been developed to reduce the frequency or impact of distal embolization. These devices may be placed distal or proximal to the treated lesion. Distal devices are mounted on the guidewire and use either a suspended micropore filter to trap particulate matter of 100 to 150 µm or larger or balloon occlusion of the treated vessel with posttreatment aspiration to capture embolized material. Proximally placed devices temporarily interrupt flow and aspirate the treated vessel. The PercuSurge GuardWire Plus (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) is a balloon occlusion and aspiration device that underwent testing in vein grafts in the Saphenous Vein Graft Angioplasty Free of Emboli Randomized trial.<sup>79</sup> The trial showed a 42% reduction in creatine kinase (CK) elevations and more than a 50% reduction in the no-reflow phenomenon.<sup>79</sup> Unfortunately, these results did not apply to patients with MI.80

#### **IMAGING DEVICES**

Angiography allows imaging of the coronary lumen but may be unreliable in patients with severe calcification, difficult branching patterns, or previously placed coronary stents. Furthermore, a thrombus that may increase the risk associated with PCR may go undetected by standard angiography. Therefore, several alternative imaging methods have been developed to improve diagnosis, to plan revascularization efforts, and to evaluate the success of such efforts. Angioscopy or fiber-optic imaging requires occluding the imaged vessel and perfusing it with saline. Although angioscopy is a useful tool to investigate the presence or components of thrombus within coronary vessels, it has not been a useful adjunct to PCR. In contrast, intracoronary ultrasonography has proved especially useful. Ultrasonography allows accurate

determination of vessel size, luminal reduction, lesion components, and the progress of revascularization attempts. Ultrasound guidance for stent implantation is associated with a greater than 30% reduction in the need for repeat procedures. Of equal importance, intracoronary ultrasonography is an invaluable research tool used to investigate the accuracy of contrast angiography and the impact of mural lesion components on complications and outcomes after angioplasty.

Optical coherence tomography uses the characteristics of light reflection to determine tissue characteristics, providing a visual representation of the interrogated artery that provides information about both anatomy and disease state. It is useful as a research tool, providing extremely accurate tissue thickness measurements, as well as spectacular anatomic images. Unfortunately, at the level of clinical care, optical coherence tomography offers little more information than intracoronary ultrasonography but increases case complexity.<sup>82</sup>

#### **DEVICES THAT MEASURE LESION SEVERITY**

The hemodynamic significance of coronary lesions, the appropriateness of a treatment, and the success of treatment may be determined by one of the following two means: a guidewire that measures the velocity of blood flow within coronary arteries, and a calculation of the pressure distal to a coronary lesion.

A miniaturized Doppler-equipped guidewire with a 12-MHz transducer uses a pulsed interrogation that samples 5.2 mm beyond the guidewire tip at an angle of 14° on either side. Assuming that the cross-sectional area of the interrogated vessel remains constant during all measurements, the ratio of the velocities measured reflects the ratio of blood flow between any two measurements. The most important and reliable parameter that a flow probe measures is the ratio of resting flow to vasodilated coronary flow, a value known as coronary flow reserve. When measured with the Doppler probe, the value is termed coronary velocity reserve (CVR). As a coronary lesion becomes flow limiting, attempts to normalize tissue perfusion by autoregulation result in arteriolar dilatation at rest. Therefore, the administration of an arteriolar vasodilator such as adenosine will have little additional effect on flow velocity. The absence of an appropriate increase in velocity during adenosineor dipyridamole-induced arteriolar vasodilation produces abnormal flow reserve. A CVR less than 2.0 indicates hemodynamically significant lesions.

The CVR measurement reflects changes in flow relative to an assumed normal baseline state but is subject to error when baseline flow is abnormal. Examples of abnormal states include left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, fibrosis, and perhaps anemia. In addition, abnormally large or small driving pressure gradients may fall outside the range of normal coronary autoregulation, altering the basal-to-hyperemic ratio. Failure to achieve arteriolar dilatation in response to adenosine or dipyridamole will produce an abnormal calculated flow reserve. Conditions that affect arteriolar dilatation include diabetes mellitus, amyloidosis, and recent caffeine or theophylline ingestion.

An alternative to flow measurement is pressure measurement proximal and distal to the lesion in question. Under normal conditions, epicardial vessels present little detectable resistance to flow. Therefore, driving pressure  $(P_{Ao})$  and arteriolar resistance pressure  $(P_{RA})$  determine maximal coronary blood flow. The presence of a flow-limiting coronary lesion will cause some of the driving pressure to be lost, so maximal flow will depend on the distal coronary pressure  $(P_{d})$ -to- $P_{RA}$  gradient and arteriolar resistance. Therefore, the fraction of maximal basal flow that remains possible in the presence of the lesion is

$$\dot{O}_{lesion}/\dot{O}_{no\ lesion} = (P_d - P_{RA}/R_{basal})/-(P_{Ao} - P_{RA}/R_{basal})$$

Canceling resistance and assuming that right atrial pressure remains constant result in a very simple relationship:

$$\dot{O}_{\rm lesion}/\dot{O}_{\rm no\ lesion}=P_{\rm d}/P_{\rm Ao}$$

This ratio, called the myocardial fractional flow reserve (FFR), is obtained after the administration of adenosine. An FFR of 0.75 or less is used to identify a hemodynamically significant lesion. Routine use of FFR to ensure the necessity of PCI reduces the risk of adverse events, both immediately and 1 year after the procedure.<sup>83</sup>

Physicians who care for patients with coronary artery disease differ widely in their estimates of the severity of a coronary lesion. Fortunately, that conflict can be objectively resolved with FFR. Using FFR to guide revascularization decisions in most cases improves the revascularization decision, helps in assigning the patient the most appropriate care, and reduces the risk of complications and repeat procedures. Absent an alternate physiologic cue for revascularization, FFR should guide the decision in all but the most obvious cases.

#### **BRACHYTHERAPY**

Before the advent of DESs, restenosis after angioplasty or stent implantation could be treated by medical therapy, repeat angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass surgery. The high frequency of restenosis led to a large population of patients with multiple treatment failures, intractable symptoms, and prohibitive contraindications to surgical treatment. Because a proportion of the cell population colonizing a treated lesion and contributing to restenosis arose from the media of the treated lesion, radiation therapy to prevent cell replication was proposed. The well-recognized dangers of high-dose, external-beam radiation limited dosing to local application, but this therapy still was seen as posing a substantial risk. Although radiation brachytherapy is a source of increased adverse events when used as a treatment for de novo coronary lesions, it has been used with some (albeit limited) success to treat refractory in-stent restenosis.85,86

#### **CIRCULATORY SUPPORT**

Performing a percutaneous revascularization procedure includes an obligatory period of ischemia in the treated region. The duration of ischemia may be prolonged in the event of abrupt closure or distal embolization, and

recovery may be incomplete or delayed for a period of days, as in the treatment of acute MI. For patients with depressed LV systolic function and for those in whom the treated territory is large, there is a risk for developing cardiogenic shock during and after the procedure. This risk substantially increases the possibility of acute renal failure, stroke, and death. The likelihood of shock complicating an angioplasty procedure may be predicted by using a scoring method that incorporates the extent and severity of systolic dysfunction present before the procedure and the extent that can be expected as a result of the procedure (Table 19-8). <sup>39,87</sup> Elective placement of an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) is associated with a reduced risk of hypotension and major complications. <sup>88</sup>

The percutaneous left ventricular assist device (pLVAD) is a miniaturized axial-flow pump that is being used increasingly to support patients in shock or during high-risk angioplasty procedures. <sup>89</sup> The pLVAD is capable of providing up to 4 L/min of additional blood flow. The pLVAD and its variants are superior to the balloon pump in providing circulatory support and avoiding flow-related complications. However, complications at the access site and with the flow delivery limit their application to the highest-risk patients for whom we do not have an objective measure (score) to ensure benefit. <sup>90-92</sup>

#### **COMPLICATIONS**

In addition to abrupt closure and restenosis, there are several other potential complications of PCR that may influence the risk-to-benefit ratio for an individual patient. These complications include bleeding, vascular access-site complications, stroke, radiocontrast nephropathy (RCN), and MI owing to distal embolization.

#### Hemorrhage

Bleeding that necessitates transfusion or results in hemodynamic instability occurs in 0.5 to 4% of PCR procedures, depending on patient variables (eg, age, gender, presence of peripheral vascular disease), procedural variables (eg, location of femoral arteriotomy, duration), and pharmacologic

variables (eg, intensity of antithrombotic therapy).<sup>4</sup> Several devices have been designed to improve femoral hemostasis after sheath removal, but none has proven superior to standard compression hemostasis.<sup>93</sup> With the availability of lower-profile equipment, the radial artery is being used with greater frequency, which results in a reduction in bleeding and access-site complications.<sup>94,95</sup>

#### Ischemia

Stroke complicates approximately 0.18% of PCR procedures. Its occurrence is associated with increased age, depressed LV ejection fraction, diabetes mellitus, saphenous vein graft intervention, and complicated or prolonged procedures requiring the placement of an IABP. Its procedures requiring the placement of an IABP.

The frequency with which MI complicates PCR procedures depends on the definition of MI.<sup>98</sup> If MI is defined as the presence of new Q wave, the incidence is 1%,<sup>99</sup> whereas if MI is defined as any elevation of the MB fraction of CK (CK-MB), the incidence is as high as 38%.<sup>98</sup> Using more stringent definitions of infarction, such as greater than 3 or 10 times the upper limit of normal, reduces the reported values to 11 to 18% or 5%, respectively.<sup>99-101</sup> Actually, any elevation carries prognostic significance, but elevation above three times the upper limit of normal is accepted as a definition of periprocedural MI.

Elevated markers of myocardial injury may be seen after apparently uncomplicated procedures. 98 One mechanism for such events is microscopic distal embolization. When severe, microscopic distal embolization of a coronary artery creates the angiographic appearance of slow vessel filling, it is termed no- or slow-reflow. No-reflow is seen most often during saphenous vein graft angioplasty but also may complicate rotational atherectomy and primary PCR for acute MI. Methods of quantifying abnormal flow after PCR include a subjective estimation of flow velocity, the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow rate (III, normal; II, slow; I, minimal contrast material flow beyond the treated site; and 0, no flow), and the more objective method of corrected TIMI frame count. Individual frames of the angiographic image are counted from the time of contrast material entry into the treated vessel until a predetermined distal landmark is reached. No-reflow may be a brief and self-limiting phenomenon, but when prolonged, it is associated with increased mortality. 102 Pharmacologic manipulations, including intracoronary verapamil, adenosine, and nitroprusside administration, may be used in an attempt to prevent or treat the no-reflow phenomenon (see Table 19-2).

Perforation of the coronary artery complicates 0.5% of angioplasty procedures,  $^{103}$  and its frequency increases almost 10-fold when ablation devices are used (1.3% for ablation vs 0.1% for PTCA; p < .001). Coronary artery perforation occurs more frequently in elderly and female patients (Table 19-9).  $^{103,104}$ 

Pericardial tamponade is frequently but not invariably associated with coronary artery perforation. The overall incidence

of tamponade after PCI is 0.12% and doubles when ablation devices are used. Tamponade associated with PCI is recognized 55%<sup>105</sup> of the time during or after the procedure while the patient is still in the catheterization laboratory and 45% of the time after the patient leaves the laboratory.<sup>100</sup> A minority of episodes of late tamponade (13%) are associated with recognized coronary artery perforation. Tamponade requires surgical treatment in 39% of patients, is closely associated with MI complicating PCR, and carries a mortality rate of 42%.<sup>105</sup>

The covered stent that was developed to prevent, but failed to reduce the risk of, saphenous vein graft restenosis<sup>106</sup> currently is used as a rescue device after coronary artery perforation or for the treatment of coronary or saphenous vein graft aneurysms (Fig. 19-7).<sup>107</sup> When a covered stent is used to treat coronary artery perforation, the need for emergency surgery is reduced, as is the risk of coronary artery perforation. A small number of patients, however, still require surgery.<sup>108</sup>

Shown in this injection of the left coronary artery are occlusions of the left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary arteries. Staining is seen (*arrows*) in the region of the attempted recanalization of the left circumflex coronary artery, indicating perforation (type II). The patient was treated successfully with reversal of anticoagulation and temporary occlusion of the circumflex with the PTCA balloon. PTCA, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.

#### **Toxicity**

Acute renal failure after exposure to radiocontrast material, or RCN, is poorly understood. Its occurrence is a function of age, congestive heart failure, hemodynamic instability, diabetes mellitus, preexisting renal insufficiency, anemia, peripheral vascular disease, and the amount of contrast material administered. 109-111 The incidence of RCN after

coronary angiography is 5 to 6%, and the nadir of renal function occurs 3 to 5 days after the procedure. 112 Even a transient decline in renal function leads to an increased risk of ischemic cardiovascular events during follow-up, and renal failure necessitating hemodialysis is seen in about 10% of patients with RCN, increasing both short- and long-term mortality. 109,110,113

The only methods for reducing the risk of RCN are the use of iso-osmolar contrast, volume expansion, and, perhaps, acetylcysteine administration. Using iodixanol, an iso-osmolar nonionic contrast agent, reduces the incidence of RCN after noncardiac angiography. Giving four oral doses of N-acetylcysteine (600 mg each; two doses on the day before and two on the day of the procedure) to prevent RCN has had varied outcomes in several studies. Administering crystalloid solution in volumes sufficient to maintain brisk urine flow, perhaps aided by alkalinization of urine pH, is the most effective intervention for preventing RCN by ensuring an adequate volume state.

#### SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES

#### **Acute Coronary Syndromes**

Successful PTCA and stent implantation (in most instances) within the first 6 hours of ST-segment-elevation MI is at least as effective as, and perhaps more effective than, thrombolytic agents in limiting myocardial damage and improving in-hospital survival. 118-120 The routine use of coronary stents for acute MI is associated with a restenosis rate of 17% and a 6-month event-free survival of 83 to 95%. 121-124 The use of DESs reduces the risk of any adverse event from 17 to 9.4% at 300 days. 57 After failed attempts at thrombolysis or for patients with cardiogenic shock who received thrombolysis, stent revascularization increases myocardial salvage and reduces the risk of death, heart failure, or reinfarction. 125-128

Attempts to reduce the impact of reperfusion injury have been mostly ineffective. However, one remains promising: the occlusion of mitochondrial pores, which allows the release of newly generated oxygen free radicals into the cytosol. Oxygen radicals represent a form of second messenger system inside the cell, triggering inflammatory response, prothrombotic behavior, and apoptosis. Uncoupling these responses has, historically, been the purview of statins and other cholesterollowering drugs. However, cyclosporine, typically considered an immunosuppressant, may also be effective in blocking mitochondrial release of oxygen radicals. The results of small, early trials are a source of enthusiasm, but confirmation in larger trials is necessary.<sup>129</sup>

## **Previous Coronary Artery Bypass**

Stent implantation with the assistance of embolic protection devices is the preferred method for percutaneous treatment of occluded saphenous vein grafts. The use of distal embolic protection reduces the risk of periprocedural MI from 14.7 to 8.6%. Unfortunately, diseased grafts have a high probability

of developing new lesions, reducing long-term event-free survival. After stent implantation, overall survival is 79% at 4 years, but survival free of MI or another revascularization procedure is only 29%. <sup>130-134</sup> DESs reduce the risk of restenosis after saphenous vein graft PCR but do not affect the likelihood of disease progression elsewhere in the diseased graft. <sup>52</sup>

#### THE FUTURE

The future of interventional cardiology lies in reducing procedural risk and extending treatment durability. For many patients, the goal of providing durable treatment success has been very nearly achieved with the introduction of DESs, an approach that has yet to be fully explored. However, a DES does not reduce procedural risk, and problems remain for patients with diffuse atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, bifurcation lesions, and ACSs. In cases in which it is not clear whether PCI or surgical revascularization is more likely to produce a favorable outcome, the Synergy between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) score can be used to make an objective decision.<sup>135</sup> The original SYNTAX score was developed to quantify—wholly on the basis of angiographic findings—the procedural risk and the odds of long-term success of revascularization by DES placement or surgical procedures. A modified version of the score includes clinical risk factors that appear to add predictive value to that of the anatomic data: LV function, renal function, and lung disease (for the latest version of the SYNTAX score calculator, see http://syntaxscore.com). Using this combined scoring method, the likely short- and long-term outcomes of both surgical and percutaneous revascularization may be compared objectively to guide the choice of revascularization method. The adoption, utilization, and regular refinement of the SYNTAX score will be difficult but necessary to match the right patient to the right treatment (Table 19-10). 136

Ironically, the goal of reducing procedural risk has been pursued most effectively for saphenous vein graft

revascularization with the development of distal embolic protection devices. However, for native-vessel interventions, particularly those performed during ACSs, further advances will probably be pharmacologic rather than technical. As evidenced by observations of ischemic preconditioning, modification of myocardial energy metabolism with drugs, such as ranolazine and others, represents a means of improving the heart's ability to withstand ischemia, thus temporizing the impact of temporary vascular occlusion and macro- or microembolization.<sup>137-139</sup> In addition, inhibitors of the protein kinase family of enzymes, central to intracellular signaling, also may improve the heart's ability to withstand ischemia and reduce the severity of reperfusion injury.<sup>129</sup>

Local drug delivery has been met with great success in reducing the problem of restenosis. However, there are numerous methods of modifying the physiology that drives intimal hyperplasia after stent implantation. New DES platforms offer the alternative of eluting multiple drugs at different rates, thereby reducing the need for systemic medical therapy, such as prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy. In addition, complex molecules that can be absorbed by the body are being developed as stent platforms. The use of a stent that delivers antithrombotic and antiproliferative drugs could conceivably allow PCR protection from acute closure, recoil, thrombosis, and restenosis without contributing to vessel rigidity that increases the difficulty of subsequent procedures.

A growing number of patients who are surviving longer with severe multivessel coronary artery disease remain hampered by severe angina pectoris. In many instances, years of slow, steady disease progression have left extensive collateral vessels that prevent infarction and the near or complete loss of major branch vessels. These patients currently have no option for percutaneous or surgical revascularization. For this population, the use of stem cells, perhaps the most efficient producers of cytokines and growth factors in their proper sequence, has been met with early success. Direct injection of stem cells into regions of ischemic myocardium improves walking time and reduces the frequency of angina attacks.<sup>140</sup>

#### **KEY POINTS**

- Percutaneous revascularization is best used to control unacceptable symptoms in patients whose anatomy suggests low procedural risk and a good probability of longterm success.
- 2. Stent implantation substantially improves the safety of PCI, and the use of DESs reduces the likelihood of long-term treatment failure. However, the use of DESs requires that patients be candidates for long-term, dual antiplatelet drug therapy.
- **3.** Measurement of the FFR is crucial for determining the necessity of revascularization. In addition, its routine use for evaluating moderate lesions reduces the risk of major procedural complications compared to angiographic analysis alone.

- **4.** When possible, all saphenous vein graft interventions should be performed with distal protection devices in place.
- 5. In patients who, for clinical reasons, can be treated by either percutaneous or surgical means, the modified SYN-TAX score should be used to ensure an objective decision regarding the most appropriate therapy.
