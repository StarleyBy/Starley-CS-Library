# Surgery for Adult Congenital Heart Disease

Redmond P. Burke

Adults with congenital heart disease now outnumber children with this malady. They constitute a growing population of survivors, with increasingly complex treatment requirements for their heart disease. Over the past two decades, the spectrum of complexity for adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients has evolved from late primary repairs of patients with simple lesions—including coarctation, patent ductus arteriosus, septal defects, and tetralogy of Fallot—to nth time reoperations on survivors of complex multistaged palliations. Significant efforts to define the optimal program resources necessary to effectively treat ACHD patients have been made worldwide,1 yet many congenital heart patients continue to suffer from poor continuity of care as they enter adulthood. This chapter will describe several salient treatment strategies for adult patients undergoing congenital heart surgery.

## REDUCING CUMULATIVE THERAPEUTIC TRAUMA

The optimal venue for ACHD treatment is unknown, and it is fair to say that no two programs are the same. The need for a coordinated and comprehensive programmatic strategy for care has been well described, and should encompass not only the lifetime of a generation of patients with congenital heart defects from fetal to adult life, but also the health of pregnant mothers with congenital heart disease who will give birth to a new generation.<sup>2</sup> Pregnant mothers with fetal diagnoses of congenital heart disease may be asked to undergo invasive intrauterine procedures to palliate their fetal child's heart, thus creating a new group of adult patients dealing with the trauma of congenital heart care.<sup>3</sup>

Our congenital heart program philosophy is to reduce the cumulative trauma of care for each patient with congenital heart disease over their lifetime. To achieve this, we discuss each adult patient referred to our program for surgery or intervention in a combined conference with participation from adult and pediatric interventional cardiologists and surgeons, dedicated cardiac intensivists, cardiac anesthesiologists, cardiac imaging specialists, and the cardiac nursing, pharmacy

and social work teams. Treatment options are selected so that the least traumatic form of effective therapy is chosen as the initial approach. Failure to achieve a good result leads to an escalation to the next least traumatic option. As an example, a patient with a secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) would be put forward for device closure, and if this failed, the patient would then be given the option of a minimally invasive surgical repair.

#### **INFORMATION SYSTEMS**

Adult congenital heart disease patients with complex lesions often have dense medical histories, stored in multimedia formats, which expose the weaknesses of current paper and electronic medical record (EMR) systems. Increasing utilization of EMRs by medical teams, and personal health records (PHRs) by patients and families, has been demonstrated to improve outcomes in some patients with chronic disease.<sup>4</sup> However, pediatric heart patients and their families often have not been educated about their disease, and what to expect as they transition to adulthood. The PHR could be used to enhance patients' understanding, and provide roadmaps for follow-up treatments and diagnostic studies. These information systems could also be linked to national and international registries designed to measure clinical outcomes and performance for centers treating adult congenital heart patients.<sup>5</sup>

The emergence of Web-based hospital EMR systems allows our cardiac team to track patients over their lifetime, and retrieve critical patient information on demand. We have also enabled our patients to access specific data fields from the EMR. We capture intraoperative endoscopic images of each congenital heart lesion, before and after repair,<sup>6</sup> and store these images in our EMR. We also capture and store a daily picture of each hospitalized patient. These images are reviewed in morbidity and mortality conferences, to correlate with other clinical information and imaging techniques. The operative images are reviewed prior to reoperations, to regain familiarity with the patient's anatomy.<sup>7</sup> The operative images from this chapter were retrieved from this online image database (Fig. 56-1).

These images were captured in the operating room, and immediately uploaded to a Web-based EMR. These can be retrieved on demand by searching by procedure, diagnosis, or individual patient.

## COMMON ADULT CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE PROCEDURES

#### Reoperative Sternotomy

Congenital heart procedures in adults are frequently reoperations, however, standardized protocols for reoperations in patients with acquired heart disease may not match the challenges presented by ACHD patients. Risk factors for traumatic repeat sternotomy in ACHD patients differ from those identified in patients with acquired heart disease, which often focus on dealing with patent coronary artery bypass grafts. Femoral cannulation is often difficult in ACHD patients who have undergone multiple interventional catheterizations during their growth years, resulting in stenotic or occluded femoral vessels. Consequently,

we rarely use elective or emergent peripheral cannulation. Key risk factors for ACHD reoperations include retrosternal ventricular to pulmonary artery conduits, particularly if they are calcified, have multiple stents in place, or are clearly embedded in the sternum. Fusion to the sternum should be suspected when the conduit does not move with the cardiac cycle on lateral angiograms. Patients with pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular enlargement, prior sternal infections, aneurysms of the right or left ventricular outflow tracts, pectus excavatum, or aortopulmonary shunts are at increased risk, and qualify for preliminary vascular access dissection and pursestring placement. Patients with multiple risk factors may be placed on bypass to decompress the right ventricle prior to sternal division.

We excise previous sternotomy scars and remove sternal wires. The xiphoid process is removed, and cautery dissection

is begun at the inferior sternal edge. The oscillating saw is used to divide the anterior sternal table. Rakes are used to elevate the two sides of the sternum and expose the retrosternal scar. Short segments of retrosternal scar are released, followed by gradual sternal division with the oscillating saw, proceeding up the sternum.

In the event of cardiac or great vessel penetration during sternotomy, when we have not already exposed vessels for cannulation, we release the sternal retractors, and immediately extend the neck incision up and to the right to expose the innominate artery and the internal jugular or high innominate vein. These vessels are cannulated through pursestrings, and bypass is initiated. In patients where venous access cannot be achieved in the suprasternal area, we dissect the inferior vena cava just above the diaphragm. This approach has been described as "simplified aortic cannulation." The sternotomy is completed with the patient in Trendeleberg position. We continuously infuse carbon dioxide into the operative field during every operation to reduce the risk of air embolism, although evidence supporting this technique is not conclusive. <sup>10</sup>

To reduce adhesion formation, and decrease the risk of future sternotomy, we prevent cardiac dessication by covering the heart with saline-soaked gauze throughout each operation. At the completion of ACHD repairs we occasionally place antiadhesion materials to decrease retrosternal adhesions. In some centers, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is routinely placed behind the sternum prior to closure. Capsule formation may obscure natural tissue planes, making subsequent reoperative dissection more difficult. Bioresorbable films and sheets of extracellular matrix derived from pig jejunum have also been approved for use as pericardial substitutes.

#### **Atrial Septal Defects**

The advent of transcatheter device closure for ASDs has significantly changed the average complexity level of ACHD surgical case volumes. Patent foramen ovale and most secundum defects are effectively closed with devices, and are rarely referred for surgical closure in programs with effective interventional catheterization teams. Sinus venosus and primum defects, transitional and complete atrioventricular canal, common atrium, and secundum defects with deficient inferior and superior rims are referred for surgery and we repair these on cardiopulmonary bypass with bicaval cannulation and ischemic arrest.

Multiple incisional approaches have been described to improve the cosmetic result, and reduce operative trauma, after open-heart surgery. These include partial upper and lower sternotomy, transxiphoid, anterior thoracotomy, and submammary incisions. Despite the visible scar, median sternotomy may be the least traumatic incision for ACHD patients, allowing the surgeon to avoid vascular trauma from peripheral cannulation, intercostal muscle, vessel, and nerve damage, and mitigate the risk of post-thoracotomy pain syndrome. Median sternotomy

allows direct aortic control for safe, effective cannulation, decannulation, deairing, and cardioplegia administration with minimal risk of dissection. Median sternotomy also ensures direct and rapid access to the entire mediastinum, allowing surgeons to deal with unanticipated anatomic variations discovered at surgery, which are not uncommon in ACHD patients.

Our venous cannulation strategy for ASDs is bicaval, via the right atrial appendage into the superior vena cava, and down the inferior venal caval junction into the inferior vena cava. Smaller defects, which in the past might have been closed primarily, are now rarely referred for surgery, and we find that repairs are best performed with patch materials, ideally glutaraldehyde-treated pericardium. Placing the smooth surface on the left atrial side, we use running suture lines of fine polypropylene to create tension-free suture lines (Fig. 56-2A).

For sinus venosus defects, we place a right-angled cannula in the innominate vein, to enable exposure of the partial anomalous pulmonary veins entering the superior vena cava. The atrial incision is made laterally to avoid the sinus node area, and is extended superiorly to a point above the entrance of the highest anomalous vein. A native pericardial patch is used to close the atrial incision to avoid superior vena caval stenosis (Fig. 56-2B).

In patients with primum ASDs, the cleft mitral valve is routinely repaired with fine running polypropylene suture lines, approximating the line of contact between the leaflet segments. Even patients with competent valves are repaired, as late onset of cleft regurgitation is known to occur. Patients at risk for mitral stenosis, particularly those with a single papillary muscle in the left ventricle, may have their clefts left open to avoid valvar stenosis. Results for these repairs are excellent, even in patients at advanced ages. <sup>14</sup>

#### Ebstein's Anomaly

Surgery for Ebstein's anomaly can be performed in older patients at low risk and with good late outcome. The operation is comprised of tricuspid valve repair or replacement, and concomitant procedures such as ASD closure, arrhythmia surgery, and coronary artery bypass grafting.<sup>15</sup> Repair techniques for these patients continue to evolve. We believe the presence of an untethered and well-developed anterior tricuspid valve leaflet increases the chance of a successful repair, and have used the Cone technique in adult patients. 16 This repair requires dissection of the anterior and posterior tricuspid valve leaflets from their right ventricular attachment. The free edge of the anterior leaflet is then rotated clockwise and sutured to the septal leaflet border. This produces a coneshaped valve, fixed distally at the right ventricular apex, and proximally at the tricuspid valve annulus. The septal leaflet is incorporated into the cone wall whenever possible, and the ASD is partially closed. Results have been good, with low mortality, significantly less tricuspid regurgitation, and improvement in functional class.

(B) Operative image of two patch repair with an internal patch baffling the pulmonary veins to the left atrium, and an external patch to prevent obstruction of the superior venal caval entry into the right atrium.

#### **Fontan Revision**

In the modern era, the primary cause of death for adult patients with cyanotic lesions is arrhythmia, followed by heart failure. The Fontan patients may present with arrhythmia and complications related to systemic ventricular failure, protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), systemic venous pathway obstruction, and semilunar and atrioventricular valve dysfunction. Initial evaluations must focus on ensuring a completely unobstructed vascular pathway to the lungs. The different types of surgical technique historically used to create the Fontan circulation each have characteristic complications. Patients with intracardiac baffles and atriopulmonary connections may present with extreme right atrial enlargement, resulting in stagnant flow, right pulmonary vein compression, and arrhythmia.

Fontan conversion involves takedown of the previously created venous connection, and creation of an extracardiac cavopulmonary connection with a conduit. Because the extracardiac Fontan excludes the systemic veins from the heart, any catheterization procedures requiring atrial level intervention, particularly electrophysiology interventions, must be planned before conversion. We therefore plan Fontan conversions with our electrophysiology team, and frequently combine Fontan conversions with arrhythmia surgery, and treatment of atrioventricular valve dysfunction. Valve repairs are often complex in these patients, and replacements are often required to achieve good hemodynamic results. Results depend on the patients' underlying anatomy, right ventricular function, and pulmonary vascular resistance.

We perform extracardiac Fontan procedures with bicaval cannulation, and leave the heart warm and beating whenever possible. The inferior vena cava is transected at the cavo-atrial junction under a clamp, and the cardiac end is oversewn with a running 4-0 polypropylene suture. We use a ring reinforced expanded PTFE graft from 19 to 23 mm in diameter, and leave enough length to avoid right pulmonary vein compression. The superior anastomosis to the superior vena caval junction with the right pulmonary artery is then constructed with a running 6-0 polypropylene suture. Hybrid stenting procedures, where the interventional catheterization team comes into the cardiac operating room to deploy stents, are used to treat stenoses in the retroaortic pulmonary arteries.

In patients with complex cardiac anatomy, these Fontan revision procedures may best be performed with the participation of the electrophysiology team. This ensures effective interruption or ablation of all reentrant pathways, which may not follow the patterns seen in patients with acquired heart disease and normal cardiac anatomic relationships. A variety of Maze type procedures have been described in an effort to disrupt atrial reentrant pathways. The unpredictable anatomy of the conduction tissue in ACHD patients has resulted in frequent need for pacemaker insertion. In many centers, customized pacemaker therapy has been advocated for management of patients following Fontan conversion. However,

based on an experience with 120 Fontan conversion from 1994 to 2008, which began with a flexible approach to each patient's anticipated pacing needs, Tsao et al now recommend routine placement of a dual-chamber antitachycardia pacemaker with bipolar steroid-eluting leads in patients undergoing Fontan revision.<sup>21</sup>

#### Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Reconstruction

Right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) reconstruction after previous repair of tetralogy of Fallot, double outlet right ventricle, pulmonary atresia, truncus arteriosus, and arterial switch procedures are increasingly common, as patients who underwent successful neonatal and infant repairs are returning with pulmonary insufficiency and/or stenosis, resulting in right ventricular dysfunction, exercise intolerance, arrhythmias, and sudden death.<sup>22</sup> The first percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement was performed by Bonhoeffer and colleagues in 2000,<sup>23</sup> and this therapy is increasingly available as clinical trials have demonstrated safety and efficacy, and improvement in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class is evident at 1-month postprocedure.<sup>24</sup> This less invasive therapy has accelerated the study of ACHD patients with pulmonary valve disease who were previously followed for years to avoid the trauma of reoperation. The growing experience with transcatheter pulmonary valve insertion into previously placed RVOT homografts and conduits suggests that homograft infection is rare, and stent fractures are more common (32%), but benign. The percutaneous valves have a median maximum instantaneous gradient across the RVOT of 23 mm Hg.25 With surgical standby, patients with rupture can be placed on emergent bypass, and undergo surgical repair with good results.<sup>26</sup> Indications for pulmonary valve replacement in ACHD patients are evolving, and optimal indications and timing remain unclear. Preoperative evaluation with echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cardiac catheterization are used to identify concomitant lesions, particularly patent foramen ovale, coronary anatomy, and right ventricular dimensions and function.

For patients not amenable to transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation, our standard surgical approach includes median sternotomy, bicaval cannulation, and repair on cardiopulmonary bypass with moderate hypothermia. These repairs may be performed without ischemic arrest if provocative preoperative testing (bubble test with Valsalva) is negative; however, we prefer to perform these operations with the aorta cross-clamped. We control the branch pulmonary arteries with tourniquets and place a right ventricular vent in the atrium to create a clear operative field. If a previous right ventricular incision or patch is present, this is used as a safe reentry point, and the incision is extended fare enough to inspect the right ventricle and allow resection of obstructing intracavitary muscle bundles. Pulmonary valve replacement options include pulmonary and aortic homografts, bovine

jugular vein grafts, bioprosthetic valves, and mechanical prosthetic valves.

Homografts may be selected based on appropriate size and length to match the patient's anatomy, and echocardiographic estimates of the normal pulmonary valve dimensions for that patient's weight. Conduits must be cut to the appropriate length to prevent tension (too short) and kinking (too long). We perform the distal pulmonary artery anastomosis with a running 6-0 monofilament polypropylene suture, and then trim the proximal homograft muscle cuff to match the right ventricular incision. The proximal anastomosis is constructed with a larger running suture and needle, and care is taken to avoid the left main and anterior descending coronary arteries. When these cannot be visualized due to epicardial scarring, we use intraoperative fluorescent imaging to map the coronary arteries on the surface of the right ventricle.<sup>27</sup> The anterior portion of the outflow tract is completed with a patch of native or bovine pericardium (Fig. 56-3).

The bovine jugular vein valve is sized and implanted in a similar way to homografts, with a distal running suture line. The proximal graft is beveled, so that a separate hood patch is not necessary. Ten years after implantation, bovine jugular vein grafts have significantly less failure, dysfunction, and explant rates, than pulmonary homografts in matched patient groups (Fig. 56-4).<sup>28</sup>

Bioprosthetic and mechanical valves are positioned in the RVOT at the normal pulmonary valve annulus in patients with normal right ventricular anatomy, or in a position that avoids sternal compression (more distal implantation is often necessary after repair of truncus arteriosus and pulmonary atresia). Compression of the left main coronary artery must also be considered when positioning these rigid valve rings. We have used both an interrupted horizontal mattress suture technique, and a running polypropylene suture technique for these implants. Both require that the valve suture line be constructed so that the valve orients parallel to the main

pulmonary, avoiding the tendency for the valve to aim up toward the sternum. The surgeon must also ensure that valve struts do not obstruct the branch pulmonary arteries. A patch may be used to close the main pulmonary artery and infundibulum when the implanted valve does not fit in the native outflow tract (Fig. 56-5).

Advantages and disadvantages exist for each pulmonary valve replacement option.<sup>29</sup> Homografts and bovine jugular veins have length and can be used to span long gaps between the right ventricle and the branch pulmonary arteries. The distal anastomosis can be configured to repair stenotic sections of the main pulmonary artery and the proximal branches. They also form suitable conduits for subsequent insertion of transcatheter pulmonary valves in the future if they become stenotic or insufficient. We try to tailor our conduit decisions to meet the implantation requirements for transcatheter pulmonary valve insertion. These evolving requirements

![](_page_5_Picture_6.jpeg)

**FIGURE 56-5** Reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract with a bioprosthetic valve using a running suture technique and an onlay patch.

are factored into our decision process in selecting a conduit during our current surgical pulmonary valve replacements. Available bioprosthetic valves are also suitable for subsequent insertion of a transcatheter valve, as the valve ring provides a stable landing zone for the transcatheter valve stent. Mechanical valves do not allow subsequent placement of a transcatheter pulmonary valve, and we no longer use them for in the pulmonary position. RVOT reconstruction can now be performed with low morbidity and mortality, and conduit options continue to expand.

#### Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Reconstruction

Isolated areas of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) are less common in ACHD patients than in those with acquired left-sided lesions. ACHD patients with LVOTO must be evaluated for upstream and downstream stenoses, as multiple levels of obstruction are common. Patients with Shone's syndrome often undergo numerous surgical and interventional procedures over their lifetimes, and these interventions are at best palliative. Adult congenital teams must be prepared to perform primary Ross, Ross-Konno, and Konno procedures, and deal with reoperations for each of these palliations. The Ross operation is often used in pediatric patients with complex LVOTO to treat combined valvar and supravalvar lesions, avoid anticoagulation, and maintain some growth potential. These patients may require reoperations as adults to replace or repair failing neo aortic valves, and stenotic or regurgitant pulmonary valves. Follow-up of right ventricular reconstructions after Ross operations shows that 4% of patients will require conduit replacement for right ventricular dysfunction at 10 years. Conduit size less than 14 mm is an independent predictor of allograft dysfunction.<sup>30</sup>

Freedom from reoperation for regurgitation of the pulmonary autograft in the aortic position is quite variable, with reports from 87<sup>31</sup> to 96%.<sup>30</sup> The advent of percutaneous aortic and pulmonary valve options may increase the utilization of the Ross operation, as reinterventions on the autograft and allograft may not require reoperation. Aneurysmal dilation of the neo aortic root after the Ross operation is related to use of the root technique, and may be seen in up to 11% of patients at 7 years after surgery. Good outcomes after reoperation can be achieved, but successful repair of the autograft is more likely if the diagnosis is made early, before the neo aortic valve becomes insufficient.<sup>32</sup>

The Konno aortico ventriculoplasty is used to treat complex LVOTO in patients with supravalvar, valvar, and subvalvar obstruction, and may be encountered in adults who require initial treatment, or reoperations for valve malfunction or outgrown valves. The Ross-Konno, utilizing the transplanted pulmonary autograft with a ventricular septal patch or infundibular extension, has been shown to increase in size as the patients grow, making this an excellent option in small pediatric patients. In a review of 53 patients operated on from 1980 to 2004, with an average age of 19, Suri et al reported risk factors for overall mortality included NYHA

class (hazard ratio 2.22, p = .04). The cumulative probability of aortic valve reoperation was 19% at 5 years and 39% at 10 years, occurring in 15 patients at a median of 3.8 years. Pulmonary regurgitation was detected in six patients. Pulmonary valve replacement was performed in three (6%).<sup>33</sup>

Reoperations after Ross, Ross-Konno, and Konno procedures may be particularly challenging. This is especially true if the RVOT has been reconstructed with a large patch covering the anterior aortic wall. Exposure of the aortic root then necessitates reentry into the right ventricle. Given the high incidence of reoperations on these patients, antiadhesion barriers are recommended.

#### **Arrhythmia Surgery**

Maintaining a functional conduction system is a crucial aspect of reducing the cumulative lifetime trauma for a congenital heart patient. Despite efforts to prevent conduction tissue injury, ACHD patients are at risk for a wide array of conduction delays, as well as atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Pacemaker and defibrillator insertion, lead extractions, and generator changes are frequently complicated in ACHD patients who may have unusual anatomic pathways and stenotic or occluded veins. Epicardial lead placements are often necessary in single ventricle patients who have limited or no venous access to the endocardium. Common indications for lead removal include pocket infection, malfunctioning leads, skin erosion, endocarditis/septicemia, vena cava thrombosis, and painful leads. Lead extraction technology is evolving, and can be safely managed as a hybrid effort with a surgeon and electrophysiologist working together. A number of lead removal catheters are available using blades or laser energy to excise embedded leads. Surgical support is necessary in the event of cardiac perforation. Outcomes are generally good, even in octegenarians,<sup>34</sup> with sepsis being the strongest predictor of death after pacemaker device removal.<sup>35</sup>

Supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in adult patients with congenital heart disease. For patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter undergoing open-heart repairs, a right-sided Maze procedure can be performed with the expectation of 93% freedom from arrhythmia, and improvement in functional class.<sup>36</sup>

Minimally invasive approaches to arrhythmia surgery, such as the Mini-Maze procedure, are increasingly popular in patients with acquired heart disease and arrhythmia.<sup>37</sup> These approaches may be difficult to accomplish in certain ACHD patients because of unusual anatomic relationships, and extensive reoperative scarring, which may limit exposure through small incisions. The Cox-Maze procedure for supraventricular arrhythmias in ACHD patients is often complex, and an alternative approach using intraoperative monopolar irrigated radiofrequency ablation (IRA) has been described with good results for patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Prophylactic arrhythmia surgery for patients undergoing congenital heart repairs has been considered for high risk groups, and these strategies are evolving.<sup>38</sup>

#### **Hybrid Procedures**

We define hybrid procedures as those using combined surgical and interventional personnel and technology during a single operation. Hybrid procedures can be performed in the catheterization laboratory, the operating room, or ideally in a hybrid procedure suite. We select the venue based on which technology is most critical for the success of a given procedure. The advent of percutaneous cardiac valve replacement and endovascular stenting reinforce the need to embrace a unified team approach for adult congenital heart patients. In those requiring interventional, surgical, and electrophysiological procedures, we attempt to integrate the procedures into a single hybrid operation, with the surgical team providing the least traumatic form of vascular access. Surgeons can also provide central vascular and direct cardiac access for sheath placement in patients with stenotic or occluded peripheral vessels, or when placing large devices in small patients. We routinely deploy aortic and pulmonary artery stents in the operating room using direct vision, video assisted cardioscopy, and angiography (Fig. 56-6).

Elective or emergent cardiopulmonary bypass support should be available on demand in the hybrid operating room, catheterization laboratory, and cardiac intensive care unit (Fig. 56-7).

Real-time consultation between surgeons and interventionalists may enhance outcomes for patients undergoing transvascular stent, device, and valve implantations. With a surgeon's input at the time of implantation, pulmonary artery stents may be positioned to facilitate subsequent operations. For example, pulmonary artery stents may be positioned more proximally to avoid damage to small distal branches at the time of reoperation. Aortic arch stent positioning can be optimized to reduce the distance down the distal arch the surgeon must dissect if reoperation is required to open a stent that cannot reach adult size. This type of planning and teamwork has proven to be useful in the emerging experience with transcatheter aortic valve replacements.<sup>39</sup>

#### Coarctation of the Aorta

Primary and recurrent coarctation of the aorta in adult patients is increasingly managed percutaneously with balloon dilation and stents.<sup>40</sup> We provide surgical backup for these procedures in the event of device migration, dissection, or rupture, and occasionally to establish vascular access. When transcatheter therapy is not feasible, we proceed with surgical repair of adults with coarctation and aortic arch obstruction. These operations are performed through a left thoracotomy in patients with a left aortic arch, and the perfusion team is on standby for left atrial appendage to descending aortic cardiopulmonary bypass. Three general techniques can be used, including coarctation resection with end-to-end anastomosis, onlay patch enlargement with tissue or prosthetic patch, and synthetic tube interposition. Aortic mobility is limited in adult patients, and tension-free repairs most often require interposition grafts. We use subcutaneous local anesthetic infusion catheters and liposomal bupivacaine to control postoperative pain. We anticipate labile blood pressure responses in patients with long-standing hypertension. Postoperative hypertension is common and responds to sodium nitroprusside. Mortality for these procedures is rare, and at follow up 75% of patients will be normotensive without medication.<sup>41</sup>

## INTERVENTIONAL DEVICE MANAGEMENT

Cardiac surgeons will increasingly encounter ACHD patients with intravascular devices in the aorta and pulmonary arteries, atrial<sup>42</sup> and ventricular septal occlusion devices, and transcatheter stented valves. Vascular stents are being effectively used in neonates and infants, with the understanding that patients will inevitably outgrow the maximum size these stents can achieve. <sup>43</sup> We have a growing experience with reoperations on patients who have outgrown stents in the aortic arch and the branch pulmonary arteries, and these are far more common than reoperations involving septal occlusion devices. At reoperation early after stent implantation, within 3 months or less, it may be possible to completely remove

the stent by chipping away with the cells using scissors. The stents can be collapsed inward and peeled away from the vessel wall. After 3 months, vascular ingrowth is usually substantial enough that the stent is incorporated into the vessel wall, making removal difficult and traumatic. When patients undergo reoperations to enlarge stents which have reached their maximum diameter, operative planning requires consideration of the optimal location of the longitudinal incision made to open the stent, anticipating that the stent will have to be spread open like a hot dog bun to create space for an onlay patch. This requires that every link be cut to the distal ends of the stent to avoid leaving a persistent complete ring of metal in the vessel wall (Fig. 56-8).

Stents often end close to branch points, so the distal extension of the stent incision must be planned to avoid spiral tears into smaller branch vessels, which may result in branch occlusion. Onlay patches may be constructed with native or bovine pericardium, PTFE grafts, pulmonary or aortic homografts, or extracellular matrix grafts. If the final vessel reconstruction does not achieve a full adult-sized vessel lumen, or is compressed by adjacent structures, the patched split stent is a safe landing zone for subsequent placement of an adult-sized stent. We have placed these stents immediately in the operating room as a hybrid procedure, or later, after the patched vessel has time to heal, thus reducing the risk of suture line rupture and bleeding.

Atrial septal stents are occasionally used to achieve unrestrictive flow across the atrial septum when restriction develops after previous surgical septectomy. 44 At late reoperation, these stents are firmly encased in septal tissue, and may extend into the pulmonary vein orifices. When necessary, these stents can be removed with scissor dissection, trimming the exposed metal, peeling out the embedded sections, and enucleating the ingrown scar tissue. The atrium must be inspected for full thickness tears, which are repaired with polypropylene suture.

## IMPROVED OUTCOMES USING CONGENITAL HEART SURGEONS TO TREAT ADULT CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE

Management guidelines for adults with congenital heart disease have been developed by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology.<sup>45</sup> In a review of 72 US centers performing ACHD surgery, Patel and Kogon reported 2800 operations performed per year, ranging from 0 to 230 (median 28) per program. There were a median of two surgeons per program, with each surgeon averaging 20 cases per year. 46 While individual surgeon and program results will vary, patients with ACHD appear to have better outcomes when they are repaired by surgeons who primarily perform pediatric congenital heart surgery (1.87% mortality), compared to surgeons who primarily operated on acquired adult heart disease (4.84% mortality, p < .0001). 47 Patients with congenital heart disease are living longer. Arrhythmia remains the primary contributing cause of death for those with cyanotic lesions. Myocardial infarction is now the leading contributing cause for adults with noncyanotic congenital heart disease consistent with late survival and an increasing impact of acquired heart disease. With increasing experience and a team approach synthesizing surgery, intervention, electrophysiology, anesthesia, nursing and intensive care, adults with congenital heart disease should experience improved outcomes with less cumulative lifetime therapeutic trauma.
