# Temporary Mechanical Circulatory Support

Edwin C. McGee, Jr. • Nader Moazami

A number of ventricular assist devices (VADs) are available for acute circulatory support. As opposed to long-term VADs, which are designed primarily for bridge to transplantation or long-term support in the nontransplant patient, temporary VADs are designed to reestablish adequate organ perfusion rapidly. Patients in cardiogenic shock require early aggressive therapy. Despite relief of ischemia, inotropic drugs, and control of cardiac rhythm, some patients remain hemodynamically unstable and require some type of mechanical circulatory support in order to restore a normal cardiac output and maintain end-organ perfusion. Cardiogenic shock occurs in 2.4 to 12% of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).1 The landmark Should We Emergently Revascularize Occluded Coronaries for Cardiogenic Shock (SHOCK) trial demonstrated mortality of greater than 50% despite revascularization.<sup>2</sup> If instituted promptly, temporary mechanical support leads to improved survival in this group of patients.<sup>3</sup> The need for circulatory support in the postcardiotomy period is relatively low and has been estimated to be in the range of 0.2 to 0.6%,4 but when it occurs, it needs to be managed effectively if the patient is to be salvaged. Additional indications for acute VADs are in chronic heart failure patients who suffer cardiovascular collapse, and severe cases of myocarditis and postpartum cardiomyopathy.

All practicing cardiac surgeons should have an understanding of current devices, and have at least one of these support systems available. Studies show that even smaller facilities that do not have advanced heart failure programs can have improved patient survival if a device can be implemented rapidly and the patient is transferred to a tertiary care facility with expanded capabilities.<sup>5</sup>

This chapter describes the devices currently available, indications for support, patient management, and the overall morbidity and mortality associated with temporary mechanical support. In addition, it describes some of the more promising devices that have just received approval or are currently undergoing trial. The goal of all temporary assist devices is to alleviate shock and establish an environment in which the native heart and end organs can recover. If recovery is unlikely, then a bridge to a long-term device, typically for bridging to a heart transplant, may be the best strategy. Rarely should

individuals be supported directly to heart transplantation from an acute support device, because the newer generations of long-term devices typically provide more reliable support and allow for better rehabilitation in an out-of-hospital setting. It may be possible to bridge a patient who is not a transplant candidate to a long-term device, but given that these patients often are older with comorbities, bridging a patient from an acute VAD to a long-term DT pump must be done with caution.

## **COUNTERPULSATION**

Intra-aortic balloon pumps (IABPs) are often the first line of mechanical assistance utilized for patients in cardiogenic shock. The concept of increasing coronary blood flow by counterpulsation was demonstrated by Kantrowitz and Kantrowitz in 1953 in a canine preparation and again by Kantrowitz and McKinnon in 1958 using an electrically stimulated muscle wrap around the descending thoracic aorta to increase diastolic aortic pressure. In 1961, Clauss and colleagues used an external counterpulsation system synchronized to the heartbeat to withdraw blood from the femoral artery during systole and reinfuse it during diastole.<sup>7,8</sup> One year later, Moulopoulos and colleagues produced an inflatable latex balloon that was inserted into the descending thoracic aorta through the femoral artery and inflated with carbon dioxide.8 Inflation and deflation were synchronized to the electrocardiogram to produce counterpulsation that reduced end-systolic arterial pressure and increased diastolic pressure. In 1968, Kantrowitz reported survival of one of three patients with postinfarction cardiogenic shock refractory to medical therapy using an IABP.9 These pioneering studies introduced the concept of supporting the failing circulation by mechanical means.

# Physiology

The major physiologic effects of the IABP are a concomitant reduction in left ventricular afterload along with an increase in coronary perfusion pressure secondary to an increase in aortic diastolic pressure.<sup>10</sup> Important related effects include

reduction in left ventricular systolic wall tension and oxygen consumption, reduction in left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes, reduced preload, and an increase in coronary artery and collateral vessel blood flow.<sup>11</sup> Cardiac output increases because of improved myocardial contractility owing to increased coronary blood flow and the reduced afterload and preload, but the IABP does not directly move or significantly redistribute blood flow.<sup>12</sup> IABP counterpulsation reduces peak systolic wall stress (afterload) by 14 to 19% and left ventricular systolic pressure by approximately 15%.<sup>12</sup> Because peak systolic wall stress is related directly to myocardial oxygen consumption, myocardial oxygen requirements are reduced proportionately. As measured by echocardiography and color-flow Doppler mapping, peak diastolic flow velocity increases by 117% and the coronary flow velocity integral increases by 87% with counterpulsation.<sup>13</sup> Experimentally, collateral blood flow to ischemic areas increases up to 21% at mean arterial pressures greater than 90 mm Hg.14

Several variables affect the physiologic performance of the IABP. The position of the balloon should be just downstream of the left subclavian artery (Fig. 18-1). Diastolic augmentation of coronary blood flow increases with proximity to the aortic valve. <sup>15</sup> The balloon should fit the aorta so that inflation nearly occludes the vessel. Experimental work indicates that for adults, balloon volumes of 30 or 40 mL significantly improve both left ventricular unloading and diastolic coronary perfusion pressure when compared with smaller volumes. Inflation should be timed to coincide with closure of the aortic valve,

which for clinical purposes occurs at the dicrotic notch of the aortic blood pressure trace (Fig. 18-2). Early inflation reduces stroke volume, increases ventricular end-systolic and -diastolic volumes, and increases both afterload and preload. Diastolic counterpulsation is visualized easily as a pressure curve in the arterial waveform and indicates increased diastolic perfusion of the coronary vessels (and/or bypass grafts). Deflation should occur as late as possible to maintain the duration of the augmented diastolic blood pressure but before the aortic valve opens and the ventricle ejects. For practical purposes, deflation is timed to occur with the onset of the electrocardiographic R wave. Active deflation of the balloon creates a suction effect that acts to decrease left ventricular afterload (and therefore myocardial oxygen consumption).

Physiologic factors that influence the in situ hemodynamic performance of the IABP include heart rate and rhythm, mean arterial diastolic pressure, competence of the aortic valve, and compliance of the aortic wall. Severe aortic regurgitation is a contraindication to use of the IABP as a very low mean aortic diastolic pressures reduce aortic root pressure augmentation and coronary blood flow. A calcified, noncompliant aorta increases diastolic pressure augmentation but risks injury to the aortic wall. On the other hand, young patients with a highly elastic, compliant aorta may manifest decreased diastolic pressure augmentation.

For an IABP to perform optimally, a regular heart rate with an easily identified R wave or a good arterial pulse tracing with a discrete aortic dicrotic notch is required. Current

**FIGURE 18-2** Illustration showing the effect of the intra-aortic balloon on aortic pressure. After ejection produces the pulse (A), inflation of the balloon increases aortic diastolic pressure (B). At end diastole, sudden deflation reduces aortic end-diastolic pressure (C) below that of an unassisted beat and reduces afterload and myocardial oxygen demand.

balloon pumps trigger off the electrocardiographic R wave or the arterial pressure tracing. Both inflation and deflation are adjustable, and operators attempt to time inflation to coincide with closure of the aortic valve and descent of the R wave. During tachycardia, the IABP usually is timed to inflate every other beat; during chaotic rhythms, the device is timed to inflate in an asynchronous fixed mode that may or may not produce a mean decrease in afterload and an increase in preload. In unstable patients, every effort is made to establish a regular rhythm, including a paced rhythm, so that the IABP can be timed properly. The newer-generation IABP consoles come with algorithms that select the most appropriate trigger mode and time inflation and deflation automatically which have been further enhanced by fiber-optic transducers at the tip of the IABP which do not require a conventional fluidfilled transducer to accurately reflect arterial pressure and are more easily timed.<sup>17</sup>

## Indications

The traditional indications for insertion of the IABP are cardiogenic shock, uncontrolled myocardial ischemic pain, and postcardiotomy low cardiac output. <sup>18</sup> Additional indications for IABP have broadened to include patients with high-grade left main coronary artery stenosis, high-risk or failed percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, atherectomy, or stents; patients with poorly controlled ventricular arrhythmias before or after operation; and patients with postinfarction ventricular septal defect (VSD) or acute mitral insufficiency after myocardial infarction (MI). <sup>19</sup> Occasionally an IABP is used prophylactically in high-risk patients with poor left ventricular function (LVF) with either mitral regurgitation or preoperative low cardiac output owing to hibernating or stunned myocardium. These patients may benefit from temporary afterload reduction in

the prebypass period and during weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass.

## Techniques of Insertion

The IABP usually is inserted into the common femoral artery either by the percutaneous technique or surgical cut down. A cut down is used most often during cardiopulmonary bypass when the pulse is absent. To avoid a formal cut down, a femoral artery catheter may be inserted in anticipation of IABP use in patients undergoing complex procedures who have myocardial dysfunction .The superficial femoral artery is avoided because of its smaller size and increased possibility of leg ischemia. For patients with small vessels, a 7-French catheter without a sheath is recommended to lessen the possibility of leg ischemia. The iliac and axillary arteries and, very rarely, the abdominal aorta are infrequently used alternate sites.<sup>20,21</sup> Direct insertion into the ascending aorta can be used intraoperatively in patients with severe aortoiliac or femoral occlusive disease that prevents passage of the balloon catheter.22,23

An IABP is inserted using Seldinger's technique. In the catheterization laboratory, both the guidewire and balloon are monitored by fluoroscopy, but this is not essential if not readily available. In the operating room, the guidewire and balloon are typically placed and positioned under transesophageal echocardiographic guidance.<sup>24</sup> The catheter can be inserted without the sheath when the size of the common femoral artery is a concern.<sup>25</sup>

Typically patients with an IABP receive heparin for anticoagulation, but this practice varies from center to center. The exit site of the catheter must be kept clean with antiseptics and covered in an effort to prevent local infection or septicemia.

A percutaneous IABP can be removed without exposing the femoral puncture site. The exit site is prepped and securing sutures are cut. The balloon catheter is disconnected from the pump and completely deflated using a 50-mL syringe. When the balloon is removed, the proximal artery is compressed and retrograde bleeding is allowed, which flushes any distal clot into the wound. The distal femoral artery then is compressed, and antegrade flushing then is allowed. Finally, steady nonocclusive pressure is held over the femoral puncture site. Pressure is maintained over the puncture site for 30 minutes to ensure that thrombus closes the hole. If the balloon is inserted via a cut down, the balloon preferably is removed in the operating room. The puncture site is closed with sutures. If blood flow to the lower limb is impaired after removal, a formal thromboembolectomy is required.

If the percutaneous needle punctures the iliac artery above the inguinal ligament intentionally or inadvertently in obese individuals, removal should be done through a surgical incision in the operating room because the backward slope of the pelvis makes pressure difficult to maintain after withdrawal, and substantial occult retroperitoneal bleeding may occur.

An IABP may be useful before insertion of more long-term left ventricular assist systems to optimize perfusion and right ventricular function. Use of an IABP in patients with chronic systolic heart failure as a bridge to transplantation or left ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy is a common practice with over half of the patients being stabilized with this strategy.<sup>26</sup> More importantly, placement of the IABP through a graft sewn to the subclavian artery is a strategy that has allowed ambulation of the patients while waiting for the next stage of therapy with a reported success rate of 93%.<sup>27</sup>

In this technique, a 6-mm graft is sewn to the artery in an end-to-side manner and the shortened standard IABP sheath is inserted into this graft.<sup>27</sup> The IABP is then placed through a separate stab wound, or through the externalized IABP sheath and then positioned under fluoroscopy and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The wound over the sheath is then closed. Some groups bury the hub of the IABP sheath, but our preference is to externalize it so that if the IABP needs to be repositioned, the wound does not need to be reopened.

In patients waiting for a new heart, the presence of an IABP qualifies a patient as 1A, or the highest status, on the UNOS heart transplant waiting list.

# **Complications**

Reported complication rates of the IABP vary between 12.9 and 29% and average approximately 20%. Life-threatening complications are rare. Leg ischemia is by far the most common complication (incidence 9-25%); other complications include balloon rupture, thrombosis within the balloon, septicemia, infection at the insertion site, bleeding, false aneurysm formation, lymph fistula, lymphocele, and femoral neuropathy. There is no significant difference in limb ischemia in the different types of IABPs clinically available. Linically available.

Balloon rupture occurs in approximately 1.7% of patients and usually is manifested by the appearance of blood within the balloon catheter and only occasionally by the pump alarm. Rupture may be slightly more common with transaortic insertion. Although helium usually is used to inflate the balloon, gas embolism has not been a problem. If rupture occurs, the balloon should be deflated forcibly to minimize thrombus formation within the balloon and should be promptly removed. If the patient is IABP dependent, a guidewire is introduced through the ruptured balloon, the original balloon is removed, and a second balloon catheter is inserted over the wire. If the ruptured balloon is not removed easily, a second balloon is inserted via the opposite femoral or iliac artery or through the axillary artery to maintain circulatory support.

Removal of a kinked or thrombosed ruptured balloon that cannot be withdrawn easily requires operative removal as forcibly removing a ruptured IABP which contains clot can disrupt the iliac or femoral artery upon removal and lead to uncontrollable hemorrhage. The catheter should be withdrawn as far as possible until resistance is met. The location of the tip should be determined by x-ray or ultrasound, and an incision should be planned to expose that segment of the vascular system. The trapped balloon is removed through an arteriotomy after control of the vascular segment is obtained.

Although the incidence of clinically significant lower leg ischemia varies in from 9 to 25% of patients, up to 47% patients have evidence of ischemia during the time the IABP is used.<sup>29</sup> Thus, the preinsertion status of the pedal pulses should be determined and recorded before the IABP is inserted in every patient. After insertion, the circulation of the foot is followed hourly by palpating pulses or Doppler ultrasound. Foot color, mottling, temperature, and capillary refill are observed. The appearance of pain, decreased sensation, and compromised circulation indicate severe ischemia that requires restoration of the circulation to the extremity as soon as possible. There are three alternatives. If the patient is not balloon dependent, the balloon is removed immediately. In the majority of patients, this relieves the distal ischemia; a few patients require surgical exploration of the puncture site, removal of thrombus and/or emboli, and reconstruction of the femoral artery. If the patient is balloon dependent, a second balloon catheter can be introduced into the opposite femoral or iliac artery and the first is removed. Several risk factors for development of leg ischemia have emerged. Female gender, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, cigarette smoking, advanced age, obesity, and cardiogenic shock are reported to increase the risk of ischemic complications after IABP. Because the IABP is inserted for compelling indications, identification of risk factors does not influence management, except to encourage removal of the device as soon as the cardiac status of the patient allows. In some series, longer duration of IABP counterpulsation is associated with an increased risk of complications.<sup>29</sup> Although most ischemic complications are the result of impairment of arterial inflow, severe atherosclerotic diseases of the descending thoracic aorta may produce embolization of atherosclerotic material. Approximately 1% of patients develop false aneurysms at the femoral puncture site either in the hospital or shortly after discharge, and rare patients develop an arteriovenous fistula. Both conditions are confirmed readily by duplex scanning.

## Results

Very few complications of IABP cause death. Rare instances of bleeding (retroperitoneal or aortic), septicemia, central nervous system injury, or aortic dissection may cause or contribute to a patient's death. Mortality is higher in patients with ischemic leg complications than in those without this complication.

Without revascularization, IABP produces a marginal increase in survival, but with revascularization, both short-and long-term survival, as well as quality of life have been shown to be improved.<sup>31</sup> However, mortality is high in patients who receive an IABP because of the cardiac problems that led to the need for the device. Overall hospital mortality

ranges from 26 to 50%. 32,33 Risk factors for hospital mortality include advanced age, female gender, high New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, preoperative nitroglycerin, operative or postoperative insertion, and transaortic insertion in one study and age and diabetes mellitus in another. A third study correlates hospital death with AMI, ejection fraction of less than 30%, NYHA class IV, and prolonged aortic crossclamp and bypass times.<sup>34</sup> Time of insertion affects hospital mortality. Preoperative insertion is associated with a mortality of 18.8 to 19.6%. Mortality for intraoperative insertion is 27.6 to 32.3%.<sup>17</sup> Postoperative IABO insertion is associated with a mortality of 39 to 40.5%. Mortality is highest at 68% for patients with pump failure, lowest at 34% for patients with coronary ischemia, and 48% for patients who had a cardiac operation. Long-term survival varies with the type of operation and is highest in patients who had cardiac transplantation or myocardial revascularization. 18 Patients who received an IABP and required valve surgery with or without revascularization have a poorer prognosis. Creswell and colleagues found 58.8% of all patients alive at 1 year and 47.2% alive at 5 years. Naunheim and associates found that nearly all survivors were in NYHA class I or II.<sup>34</sup> Approximately 18% of hospital survivors have some symptoms of lower extremity ischemia.

Given the overall ease of IABP insertion, excellent physiologic augmentation of coronary blood flow and left ventricular unloading, an IABP should be considered as the first line of mechanical support in patients who do not have significant peripheral vascular disease. There is some suggestion that preoperative prophylactic IABP insertion in high-risk patients (eg, left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] of less than 40%, unstable angina, left main stenosis of greater than 70%, or redo coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) can improve cardiac index, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and reduce mortality.<sup>35</sup> However, with meticulous myocardial protection and the judicious use of inotropes, such as epinephrine and milrinone, most groups experienced in dealing with such high-risk patients do not find routine IABP insertion helpful.

According to latest 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines on ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), use of MCS devices (including IABP) is reasonable in patients with STEMI who are hemodynamically unstable and require urgent CABG (Class IIa recommendation).<sup>36</sup> Prior to this, 2004 ACC/AHA and 2010 ESC STEMI guidelines listed specifically IABP use in cardiogenic shock as class 1B and IC recommendations, respectively, although there were no randomized trials supporting those recommendations. The IABP SHOCK II trial was a recent randomized trial of 600 patients who presented with AMI and cardiogenic shock who were to be treated with revascularization strategies. Three hundred patients received an IABP and 298 patients were treated medically. The degree of shock, and patient characteristics were similar. In this trial, there was no difference in the 30-day mortality (IABP 39.7%: control 41.3%)<sup>37</sup> and also no differences in adverse events, leading to downgrading in guideline recommendation class.<sup>38</sup>

Many surgeons consider prophylactic insertion of IABP before high-risk cardiac surgery. Although the impact of this strategy is debatable, a recent meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials has demonstrated that in highrisk patients, prophylactic IABP insertion leads to decrease in mortality, reduces the incidence of low output cardiac syndrome and translates into shorter ICU length of stay.<sup>39</sup> Application of IABP in postcardiac surgery varies widely. Most surgeons consider this as the first line of mechanical circulatory support in situations of persistent hypotension or low cardiac output in the immediate postoperative phase. Again, in postcardiotomy situations, in presence of persistent low cardiac output requiring high-dose pressor and inotropic support, the impact of IABP is limited and consideration for devices that can significantly increase flow should be given.

The standard IABP has a volume of 40 cc. A 50-cc IABP has been introduced and studies show that it leads to higher augmented diastolic pressure, greater systolic unloading, and a greater reduction of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.<sup>40</sup>

While an IABP can be helpful in the management of shock patients, it is important to understand that it is not the final therapy in terms of mechanical support for the failing heart. If the shock state persists, as evidence by a depressed cardiac index, then some form of direct mechanical support must be implemented so as to restore adequate end-organ perfusion. Failure to adequately treat a patient in cardiogenic shock will most assuredly result in the patient's demise.

## **DIRECT CIRCULATORY SUPPORT**

# Background

The need for acute cardiac support beyond cardiopulmonary bypass was clear from the early days of cardiac surgery. In 1966, the first successful use of a LVAD was reported after a double-valve operation by DeBakey, who used an assist device that was implanted in an extracorporeal location between the left atrium and the axillary artery. The patient was supported for 10 days on the pump, eventually was discharged home, and was a long-term survivor.

## **Ideal Device**

The ideal acute support device should be capable of providing adequate flow, maximizing hemodynamics, and unloading the ventricle for patients of all sizes. Current devices have addressed the problem associated with variations in patient size by being designed as extracorporeal systems. Therefore, by virtue of having small-diameter cannulae transversing the chest, the pumps can support patients with varying body surface area. The disadvantages of such a system are the potential for driveline and mediastinal infections, as well as limiting patient mobility. In addition, the length of the cannula between the heart and the device, particularly the

inflow cannula, predisposes to areas of stasis and potential thrombus generation. All current pumps require anticoagulation, which increases the ever-present threat of early postoperative bleeding. In addition, requirements for transfusion of large amounts of coagulation factors and platelets enhance the inflammatory response that is induced by surgery and is further perpetuated by the circuit. Activation of the contact and complement systems and the release of cytokines by leukocytes, endothelial cells, and macrophages further increase the potential negative and detrimental effects of use of temporary assist devices. The ensuing inflammatory cascade and volume overload can have detrimental effects on the pulmonary vascular resistance and lead to right ventricular overload, often necessitating the addition of a right ventricular assist device (RVAD).

Current temporary assist devices can be configured for biventricular support as needed, provided that the lungs can support oxygenation and ventilation. In cases of acute lung injury superimposed on circulatory failure, extracorporeal life support (ECLS) can be configured with conventional or the more recent centrifugal pumps.

The clinical scenarios that lead to the need for mechanical support all require that support be instituted in an expeditious manner. Therefore, all current devices must be easily implantable. In the postcardiotomy setting with access to the great vessels, the cannulae should allow the versatility of choosing any inflow or outflow site that is clinically indicated. In an active resuscitative setting, such as cardiac arrest in the catheterization laboratory, in which time is critical and transport to the operating room often impractical, percutaneous cannulation must be an option.

At present, the ideal device does not exist. Until innovations in the field of circulatory support lead to the development of an ideal device, the currently available technology must be tailored to the specific requirements of each patient, taking into consideration the duration of support needed.

## Indications for Support and Patient Selection

A wide range of indications exist for acute mechanical support, the primary goal of all being rapid restoration of the circulation and stabilization of hemodynamics. The routine use of TEE has helped greatly in assessing the etiology of cardiogenic shock by allowing evaluation of ventricular function, regional wall motion abnormalities, and valvular mechanics. In a patient with mechanical complications secondary to MI such as acute rupture with tamponade, acute papillary muscle rupture, or postinfarction VSD, emergent surgical correction may obviate the need for device support. Similarly, in the postcardiotomy setting with failure to separate from cardiopulmonary bypass, TEE may direct the surgeon to the need for additional revascularization and reparative valve surgery and successful weaning from bypass.

If echocardiography fails to reveal a surgically correctable cause for cardiogenic shock, most surgeons use hemodynamic

data to consider the need for mechanical assistance. These criteria include, but are not limited to, a cardiac index of less than 2.2 L/min/m<sup>2</sup>, systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure or central venous pressure of greater than 20 mm Hg, and concomitant use of high doses of at least two inotropic agents.<sup>42</sup> These situations may be associated clinically with arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, and oliguria. In such circumstances, use of an IABP may be considered as the first step. In the postcardiotomy setting, the preceding hemodynamic criteria, in absence of mechanical support, are associated with a greater than 50% chance of mortality.31 In this setting, some believe that earlier implantation of an assist device capable of supporting higher flows and allowing the heart to rest may improve results and allow for recovery of stunned myocardium. 43 Furthermore, pharmacologic agents such as the phosphodiesterase inhibitor milrinone, nitric oxide, and vasopressin have helped to optimize hemodynamics during this critical initial period, reducing the need for concomitant right ventricular support. 44,45

Once mechanical assistance has been instituted, the stabilized patient can undergo periodic evaluation to assess native heart recovery, end-organ function, and neurologic status. If appropriate, evaluation for cardiac transplantation ensues. Patients without malignancy, severe untreated infection, or neurologic deficit and who are not at an advanced age are selected for cardiac transplantation if all other criteria are met, and there is no sign of cardiac recovery. In this subgroup, we generally transition to a chronic VAD until an organ becomes available, a strategy that has been termed "a bridge to a bridge," in that a short-term device is used to "bridge" the patient to a more durable "bridge to transplant" VAD. In patients with improvement in myocardial pump function, the devices may be weaned and removed.

#### **DEVICES**

Devices currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for temporary support include centrifugal pumps, roller pumps, venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECLS, ECMO), the ABIOMED AB5000 Ventricle and Impella devices (ABIOMED, Danvers, MA), Thoratec Centrimag (Thoratec Inc., Pleasanton, CA), and the Thoratec paracorporeal VAD (pVAD) (Pleasanton, CA), and the TandemHeart system (CardiacAssist, Inc.). A number of other devices are undergoing investigation for short-term support.

# Continuous-Flow Pumps

Two types of pumps are available commercially for extracorporeal circulation: roller pumps and centrifugal pumps. In adults, roller pumps are used rarely, if ever, for temporary circulatory support beyond routine cardiopulmonary bypass applications because of important disadvantages. Although inexpensive, roller pumps are insensitive to line pressure and require

unobstructed inflow. Additionally, roller pumps may cause spallation of tubing particles and are subject to tubing failure at unpredictable times. These systems require constant vigilance and are difficult to operate for extended periods. Use of roller pumps beyond 4 to 5 hours is associated with hemolysis and, for this reason, is inappropriate for mechanical assistance that may involve several days to weeks of support. <sup>46</sup> Axial flow pumps, in which the pump rotor is parallel to the blood path, have entered the field of temporary support with the introduction of the Impella devices but most of the experience with temporary support devices has been with centrifugal pumps.

#### **CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS**

Centrifugal pumps are familiar assist systems because of their routine use in cardiopulmonary bypass. In these devices, the blood path is perpendicular to the rotor. Although many different pump-head designs are available, they all work on the principle of generating a rotary motion by virtue of moving blades, impellers, or concentric cones. These pumps generally can provide high flow rates with relatively modest increases in pressure. They require priming and de-airing prior to use in the circuit, and the amount of flow generated is sensitive to outflow resistance and filling pressures. The differences in design of the various commercially available pump heads are in the numbers of impellers, the shape and angle of the blades, and the priming volume. The Medtronic Bio-Pump® (Medtronic Bio-Medicus, Inc., Eden Prairie, MN), which is based on two concentric cones generating a rotary motion, has been extensively utilized in the field of acute circulatory support. 47 The pump heads are disposable, relatively cheap to manufacture, and mounted on a magnetic motorized unit that generates the power that drives the pump. Although earlier designs caused mechanical trauma to the blood elements leading to excessive hemolysis, the newly engineered pumps are less traumatic and can be used for longer periods.

The Rotoflow (Maquet Cardiovascular) is another example of a centrifugal pump that is extensively utilized in the field of acute circulatory support.

Complications. Complications with temporary mechanical assistance are high and are very similar for patients on centrifugal pump support or ECLS. The major complications reported by a voluntary registry for temporary circulatory assistance using primarily LVADs, RVADs, and biventricular assist devices (BVADs) are bleeding, persistent shock, renal failure, infection, neurologic deficits, thrombosis and emboli, hemolysis, and technical problems. Neurologic deficits occurred in approximately 12% of patients, and in Golding's experience, noncerebral emboli occurred equally often. Golding also found that 13% of patients also developed hepatic failure. An autopsy study found anatomical evidence of embolization in 63% of patients, even though none had emboli detected clinically.

Results. Although a meaningful comparison of results of centrifugal support from different institutions is not possible, in general, overall survival has been in the range of

21 to 41%. A voluntary registry reported the experience with 604 LVADs, 168 RVADs, and 507 BVADs; approximately 70% were with continuous-flow pumps and the remainder with pulsatile pumps. There were no significant differences in the percentage of patients weaned from circulatory assistance or the percentage discharged from the hospital according to the type of perfusion circuitry. Overall, 45.7% of patients were weaned, and 25.3% were discharged from the hospital. The registry also reports that long-term survival of patients weaned from circulatory support is 46% at 5 years. Most of the mortality occurs in the hospital before discharge or within 5 months of discharge.

Golding reported an identical hospital survival rate for 91 patients in 1992 using only centrifugal pumps, and Noon reported that 21% of 129 patients were discharged. Patients who received pulsatile circulatory assistance were supported significantly longer than those supported by centrifugal pumps, but there were no differences in the percentage of patients weaned or discharged. Survivors were supported an average of 3.1 days using continuous-flow pumps. Patients supported for AMI did poorly; only 11.5% survived to be discharged. Joyce reports that 42% of patients supported by Sarns impeller pumps eventually were discharged. <sup>52</sup>

## EXTRACORPOREAL LIFE SUPPORT (ECLS/ECMO)

By the 1960s, it was clear that cardiopulmonary bypass was not suitable for patients requiring circulatory support for several days to weeks. The development of ECLS as a temporary assist device (also referred to as *extracorporeal membrane oxygenation* [ECMO]) is a direct extension of the principles of cardiopulmonary bypass and follows the pioneering efforts of Bartlett and colleagues in demonstrating the efficacy of this technology in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome.<sup>53</sup>

There are a number of key differences between cardiopulmonary bypass and ECLS. The most obvious difference is the duration of required support. Whereas cardiopulmonary bypass typically is employed for several hours during cardiac surgery, ECLS is designed for longer duration of support. With ECLS, lower doses of heparin are used, and reversal of heparin is not an issue. Because a continuous circuit is used, areas of stasis, such as the cardiotomy suction and venous reservoir, are not present. These differences are thought to reduce the inflammatory response and the more pronounced coagulopathy that can be seen with cardiopulmonary bypass<sup>54</sup> although there is generally a rapid rise of inflammatory cytokines with initiation of ECLS support.<sup>55</sup>

A typical ECLS circuit is demonstrated in Fig. 18-3. The system consists of the following:

1. Hollow-fiber membrane oxygenator with an integrated heatexchange system. The microporous membrane provides the necessary gas-transfer capability via the micropores where there is direct blood-gas interface with minimal resistance to diffusion. By virtue of the membranes being close to each other, the diffusion distance has been reduced without a significant pressure drop across the system. Control of oxygenation and ventilation is relatively easy. Increasing

![](_page_7_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 18-3** Percutaneous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support is attained via femoral vessel access. Right atrial blood is drained via a catheter inserted into the femoral vein and advanced into the right atrium. Oxygenated blood is perfused retrograde via the femoral artery. Distal femoral artery perfusion is not illustrated.

- the total gas flow rate increases  $\mathrm{CO}_2$  removal (increasing the "sweep") by reducing the gas-phase  $\mathrm{CO}_2$  partial pressure and promoting diffusion. Blood oxygenation is controlled simply by changing the fraction of  $\mathrm{O}_2$  in the gas supplied to the oxygenator.
- 2. Centrifugal pump. These pumps are totally nonocclusive and afterload dependent. An increase in downstream resistance, such as significant hypertension, will decrease forward flow to the body. Therefore, flow is not determined by rotational flow alone, and a flowmeter needs to be incorporated in the arterial outflow to quantitate the actual pump output. If the pump outflow should become occluded, the pump will not generate excessive pressure and will not rupture the arterial line. Similarly, the pump will not generate significant negative pressure if the inflow becomes occluded. This protects against cavitation and microembolus formation. The newer generation magnetically levitated centrifugal pumps have been also used recently in the ECLS circuit and may have less traumatic effect on the blood elements.<sup>56</sup>
- **3.** Heat exchanger. This allows for control of blood temperature as it passes through the extracorporeal circuit. Generally, the transfer of energy occurs by circulating nonsterile water in a countercurrent fashion against the circulating blood. Use of

- water as the heat-exchange medium provides an even temperature across the surface of the heat exchanger without localized hot spots. The use of a heat exchanger allows for maintenance of normothermia given the potential heal loss that can occur through the long circuit.
- **4.** Circuitry interfaced between the patient and the system. The need for systemic anticoagulation on ECLS and the complications associated with massive coagulopathy and persistent bleeding during the postcardiotomy period led to the development of biocompatible heparin-bonded bypass circuits. In 1991, the Carmeda Corporation in Stockholm, Sweden, released a heparin-coating process that could be used to produce an antithrombotic surface.<sup>57</sup> This process was applied to extracorporeal tubing and the hollow-fiber microporous oxygenator surface.<sup>58</sup> Initial experience suggested that the need for systemic anticoagulation had been eliminated. In addition, heparin coating has been associated with a decrease in the inflammatory response with reduced granulocyte<sup>59</sup> and complement activation.<sup>60</sup> Bindslev and colleagues<sup>61</sup> and Mottaghy and colleagues<sup>62</sup> reported excellent hemodynamic support with minimal postoperative blood loss in experimental animals for up to 5 days. Magovern and Aranki reported similar excellent results with clinical application. 63,64

Although these heparin-bonded circuits were initially thought to completely eliminate the need for heparinization, thrombus formation without anticoagulation remains a persistent problem. In a study of 30 adult patients with cardiogenic shock who underwent ECLS using the heparin-bonded circuits and no systemic anticoagulation, 20% of patients developed left ventricular thrombus by TEE, and an additional 6% had a visible clot in the pump head. For Protamine administration after starting ECLS can precipitate intracardiac clot. If the left ventricle does not eject and blood remains static within the ventricle, clot formation is more likely. Intracavitary clot is more likely in patients with MI owing to expression of tissue factor by the injured cells. Protamine may bind to the heparinized coating of the new circuit and negate an anticoagulant effect.

Cannulation. The main difference between the centrifugal pump and ECLS is the presence of an in-line oxygenator. As a result, ECLS can be used for biventricular support by using central or peripheral cannulation. Intraoperatively, the most common application of ECLS has been for patients who cannot be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass after heart surgery. In these cases, the existing right atrial and aortic cannulas can be used. An alternative strategy is to convert the system to peripheral cannulas, which potentially permits later decannulation without opening the chest.

Cannulation is accomplished by surgical cut down or percutaneous insertion. The entire vessel does not need to be mobilized, and exposure of the anterior surface of the vessels typically suffices. A purse string suture is placed over the anterior surface of the vessel. Typically, arterial cannulae of 16 to 20 French and venous cannulae of 18 to 25 French are used. The cannulation is performed under direct vision using Seldinger's technique. A stab incision is made in the skin with a no. 11 blade knife, a needle is inserted through the stab incision into the vessel, and a guidewire is advanced gently. Dilators then are passed sequentially to gently dilate the tract and the insertion point in the vessel. The cannulae then are inserted, the guidewire is removed, and a clamp is applied. For venous drainage, a long venous cannula is directed into the femoral vein to the level of the right atrium under transesophageal echocardiographic guidance.

To minimize limb complications from ischemia, one strategy is to place an 8- to 10-French perfusion cannula in the superficial femoral artery distal to the primary arterial inflow cannula to perfuse the leg (Fig. 18-4). This cannula is connected to a tubing circuit that is spliced into the arterial circuit with a Y-connector. The distal cannula directs continuous flow into the leg and significantly reduces the incidence of leg ischemia. It should be noted, however, that limb ischemia associated with long-term peripheral cannulation relates not only to arterial perfusion, but also to the relative venous obstruction that can occur with large venous lines. In such circumstances distal venous drainage can be established by splicing another small venous cannula into the circuit.

![](_page_8_Figure_6.jpeg)

**FIGURE 18-4** Surgical exposure of the femoral vessels facilitates cannulation for ECMO. A small 10-French cannula is used to perfuse the distal femoral artery.

An alternative strategy is to completely mobilize the common femoral artery and sew a 8- or 10-mm short Dacron graft to its anterior surface as a "chimney." The graft serves as the conduit for the arterial cannula. Alternatively a standard perfusion connector may be secured in the graft and hooked to the 3/8 tubing of the circuit. This strategy also allows for a more secure connection and avoids problems with inadvertent dislodgement of the cannulas because of loosening of the purse strings or tourniquets.

In general, complete percutaneous placement of arterial cannulae is avoided to prevent iatrogenic injury during insertion and ensure proper positioning of the cannula. However, when venovenous bypass is the only mode of support needed, percutaneous cannulation is performed. Surgical exposure is not necessary, and bleeding is less with this technique.

Central cannulation sometimes is indicated because of either severe peripheral vascular disease or the desire to deliver the highly oxygenated blood directly to the coronary arteries and cerebral circulation. In patients with an open chest, aortic and right atrial cannulae may be used, but our preference is to anastomose a graft to the ascending aorta and connulate the right atrium from the femoral vein. Reinforcing purse string sutures are placed and tied over rubber chokers and buttons for later tying at decannulation. The catheters are brought through the chest wall through separate stab wounds, and after bleeding is secured, the chest may be closed.

An alternative central cannulation site is the axillary artery. The most secure cannulation strategy for the axillary artery is to sew an 8- or 10-mm graft to the vessel as a "chimney." The cannula then is placed in the graft and tied securely with several circumferential sutures and zip ties. Clinicians must be

vigilant for progressive arm edema, which can be controlled by partial occlusion of the distal axillary artery by vessel loop.

Once instituted, the system is simple enough to be monitored by trained ICU nurses and maintained by a perfusionist on a daily basis. Evidence of clots in the pump head requires a change. Leakage of plasma across the membrane from the blood phase to the gas phase may be a problem, gradually decreasing the efficiency of the oxygenator and increasing resistance to flow and necessitating oxygenator exchanges. Using this system, ECLS flows of 4 to 6 L/min are possible at pump speeds of 3000 to 3200 rpm. Higher pump speeds are avoided to minimize mechanical trauma to blood cells. Other means of improving flow include transfusion of blood, crystalloid, or other colloid solutions to increase the overall circulating volume.

Physiologically, ECLS will unload the right ventricle but will not unload the compromised left ventricle, even though left ventricular preload is reduced.<sup>68</sup> In normal hearts, the marked reduction in preload and small increase in afterload produced by the arterial inflow from the ECLS system reduce wall stress and produce smaller end-diastolic left ventricular volumes because the heart is able to eject the blood it receives. However, if the heart is dilated and poorly contracting, the increase in afterload provided by the ECLS system offsets any change in end-diastolic left ventricular volume produced by bypassing the heart. The heart remains dilated because the left ventricle cannot eject sufficient volume against the increased afterload to reduce either end-diastolic or -systolic volume. ECLS, therefore, theoretically may increase left ventricular wall stress and myocardial oxygen consumption unless the left ventricle is mechanically unloaded. If the PCWP remains high and there is evidence of pulmonary congestion, a left-sided vent, which is spliced into the venous limb of the circuit is indicated. Most groups are finding that direct LV decompression is the effective form of left-sided drainage

As mentioned, the versatility of ECLS is that it allows rapid restoration of circulation by peripheral cannulation during active resuscitation in the setting of acute cardiac arrest, acute pulmonary embolism, or patients in cardiogenic shock, who cannot be moved safely to the operating room.

An isolated RVAD is rarely indicated in the postcardiotomy setting because, in general, these patients have global biventricular dysfunction. ECLS as an RVAD (with outflow to the pulmonary artery) may be used only in patients with good function of the left ventricle who manifest right ventricular failure and hypoxia or in patients who manifest RV failure after implantation of a long-term LVAD.

Complications. The experience in adults with ECLS for postoperative cardiogenic shock is associated with high rates of bleeding. Surgical bleeding from the chest is exacerbated by anticoagulation and the consumptive coagulopathy caused by the ECLS circuit. Even without the chest wound, bleeding was the major complication in a large study of long-term ECLS for acute respiratory insufficiency. Muchrcke reported experience with ECLS using heparin-coated

circuitry with no or minimal heparin.<sup>68</sup> The incidence of reexploration was 52% in the Cleveland Clinic experience; transfusions averaged 43 units of packed cells, 59 units of platelets, 51 units of cryoprecipitate, and 10 units of freshfrozen plasma. Other important complications associated with ECLS using heparin-coated circuits included renal failure requiring dialysis (47%), bacteremia or mediastinitis (23%), stroke (10%), leg ischemia (70%), oxygenator failure requiring change (43%), and pump change (13%).68 Nine of 21 patients with leg ischemia required thrombectomy and one amputation. Half the patients developed marked left ventricular dilatation, and six patients developed intracardiac clot detected by TEE. Intracardiac thrombus may form within a poorly contracting nonejecting left ventricle or atrium because little blood reaches the left atrium with good right atrial drainage. We have observed intracardiac thrombus which is related to left ventricular dysfunction and stagnant flow. In patients on temporary VADs in whom LV clot forms, the clot is removed at the time of permanent VAD implantation.

Results. The Cleveland Clinic reported their results looking at 202 adults with cardiac failure.<sup>69</sup> With an extended follow-up up of 7.5 years (mean 3.8 years), survival was reported to be 76% at 3 days, 38% at 30 days, and 24% at 5 years. Patients surviving 30 days had a 63% chance of being alive at 5 years, demonstrating that the high early mortality remains the Achilles heal of this technology. Interestingly, patients who were weaned or bridged to transplantation had a higher overall survival (40 and 45%, respectively). Failure to wean or bridge was secondary to end-organ dysfunction and included renal and hepatic failure and occurrence of a neurologic event while on support.

The Quadrox D oxygenator (Maquet Cardiovascular) has hollow fibers constructed of poly-methylpentene (PMP) as opposed to the standard microporous polypropylene hallow fiber oxygentators. PMP membrane oxygenerators have less plasma leakage and are as such more durable. It has demonstrated improved oxygenator durability, which has led to longer periods of support ECLS. Pokersnik and colleagues from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation compared outcomes of patients supported with ECLS from 2005 to 2010.70 Forty-nine patients received ECMO following cardiac surgery. Patients were divided into three groups. Group 1 patients received a biomedicus pump with an affinity oxygenator, Group 2 patients received a Biomedicus pump with a Quadrox D oxygenator, and Group 3 patients received a Rotaflow pump with a Quadrox D oxygenator. Despite oxygenator durability improving markedly with the introduction of the Quadrox D (oxygenator exchange rate dropping from 64-7%), survival in the groups improved only from 27 to 33% with the newer systems. Formica and colleagues from Italy demonstrated a similar survival rate of 28% in a mixed group (n = 25) of primary and postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock patients who were placed on the Rotoflow ECLS (Maquet Cardiovascular) system which uses the Quadrox D oxygenator.71

## **NEWER DEVICES**

Cardiohelp™ (Maquet Cardiovascular). Cardiohelp™ is a compact ECLS system with a low priming volume and an integrated oxygenator similar to the quadrox (Fig. 18-5). The small size of the system lends itself to transport both in and out of the hospital. Arit and colleagues reported the feasibility and effectiveness of the Cardiohelp in safely transporting patients with cardiogenic shock. From 2007 to 2010, 20 shock patients were transferred from five different hospitals while supported on Cardiohelp. The patients were treated with angioplasty (n = 2), CABG (n = 6), pulmonary embolectomy (n = 1), and permanent LVAD (n = 1) after arrival at the accepting hospital. Overall survival was 62%.<sup>72</sup>

TandemHeart. The TandemHeart PTVA (percutaneous ventricular assist) System (CardiacAssist, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA) has 510K FDA approval for short-term (<6 hours) mechanical support. It was envisioned for the short-term support of highrisk percutaneous interventions in the catheterization lab.<sup>73</sup> The device is powered by a small hydrodynamic centrifugal pump that resides in a paracorporeal location. The rotor of the pump is suspended and lubricated by a fluid interface of heparinized saline. Cannulas are introduced from the femoral vessels by either percutaneous or direct insertion techniques. Pump inflow is achieved by a novel, proprietary 21-French cannula delivered across the atrial septum. Outflow typically is directed into the common femoral artery (Fig. 18-6). Position is facilitated and confirmed by fluoroscopy and intracardiac ultrasound.<sup>74</sup>

As opposed to an ECLS circuit, excellent left atrial decompression is achieved as long as the inflow cannula is appropriately positioned. The device can be introduced either in the catheterization laboratory using fluoroscopy or directly in the operating room using TEE guidance. Most of the experience with the device has been in the catheterization laboratory, where it has been used extensively to facilitate high-risk

percutaneous interventions. Flows of up to 4 L are typical. With surgically implanted larger cannulae flows up to 8 L are possible.

The TandemHeart can be configured in many ways to achieve effective mechanical support. The inlet and outlet connectors to the pump are 3/8-3/8 connectors, and as such can be connected to any of a number of commercially available percutaneous or surgically implanted cannulae.

Patients with this device are typically kept in bed, given that the device is inserted through the femoral vessels. An activated clotting time (ACT) of 200 seconds is targeted while the patients are on support. The TandemHeart is a very versatile system that can be deployed and discontinued rapidly. One beneficial aspect for postcardiotomy support is that the entire device can be removed in the ICU without reopening the patient's chest. RVAD configurations with right atrial inflow and outflow to the main pulmonary artery are possible in both open<sup>76</sup> and percutaneous configurations.<sup>77</sup> Traditionally, for percutaneous RVAD, the 21-French transeptal cannula was directed into the main pulmonary artery under fluoroscopy, and a separate right atrial cannula was placed via a femoral vein.<sup>77</sup> While achievable, the vascular access requirements were cumbersome. The PROTEK Duo (CardiacAssist, Inc.) Cannula is a dual lumen catheter designed for veno-venous ECMO. With proper positioning, it can be configured as a single cannula percutaneous RVAD. When faced with a patient that needs biventricular support, some groups are splicing an oxygenator into the circuit and using right atrial or bi-atrial drainage. In essence such a configuration converts the assist system to ECLS circuit.<sup>78</sup> With transeptal drainage, the issues of left-sided congestion, which sometimes plague ECLS patients, are nonexistent.

Karr and colleagues reported 117 patients supported with the TandemHeart. Fifty-six patients (47.9%) were undergoing CPR. Thirty-day and six-month survival were 59.8% and 54.7%, respectively. The authors concluded that the TandemHeart percutaneous VAD effectively and rapidly reversed cardiogenic shock refractory to IABP and vasopressor support.<sup>79</sup>

Gregoric and reported the outcomes of eight patients in shock secondary to critical aortic stenosis supported with preoperative TandemHeart. Five were receiving chest compressions at the time of TandemHeart Insertion. All underwent conventional aortic valve replacement after a mean duration of support of 6 days. One patient died of postoperative sepsis. The other seven patients were discharged from the hospital and were all alive at the time of the report.<sup>80</sup>

Brinkman and the group at Medical City Dallas reported on the outcomes of 22 patients supported with the Tandem-Heart device. Mean duration of support was 6.8 days with no pump failures or pump-related neurologic events. Three patients developed bleeding and two patients had lower extremity ischemic complications. In 11 patients who were neurologically intact at the time of TandemHeart insertion, five went on to receive transplants while on TandemHeart support, three went on to permanent LVAD placement, and two patients recovered. Of 11 patients with indeterminate

neurologic status or multiorgan failure, seven died, two went on to receive permanent LVADs, one was transplanted, and one patients recovered.<sup>81</sup>

It should be noted that use of a TandemHeart beyond 6 hours and use with an oxygenator are off-label uses of the device. It is important to remember that when placing a long-term VAD in a patient on Tandem support, it is necessary to repair the atrial septum. Failure to do so can lead to hypoxia caused by entrainment of unoxygenated blood across the atrial septal defect created by the TandemHeart inlet cannula.

CentriMag. The CentriMag (Thoratec, Inc., Pleasanton, CA) pump is a centrifugal pump with a fully magnetically levitated impeller (Fig. 18-7).<sup>83</sup> Very little friction is generated and it requires only a very small priming volume. It can be configured for both right- and left-sided heart support typically with central cannulation via median sternotomy. With good cannula placement, more than 9 L of support can be achieved. It has FDA 510K approval for 6 hours of use as an LVAD and has FDA approval for use as a temporary RVAD for 30 days.

The group at the University of Minnesota reported the outcomes of 12 patients supported with CentriMag BiVADs.<sup>83</sup> Of 12 patients who presented in cardiogenic shock, eight

went on to receive long-term implantable VADs, two recovered, and two died. Thirty-day survival was 75% and 1-year survival was 63%.  $^{83}$ 

Mohamedali and colleagues reviewed the outcomes of 48 patients supported with biventricular Centrimag in shock

patients as a bridge to decision from 2008 to 2013. Thirty-day survival was 56% (27 of 48) with 9 patients explanted for recovery and 14 being transitioned to a durable LVAD.<sup>84</sup>

Takayama and colleagues from Columbia reported the results of 148 patients supported with CentriMag in either biventricular (67%), isolated RVAD (26%) or LVAD (8%). They reported an overall 30-day survival of 69% and 1-year survival of 49%. Failure of medical management and graft failure after heart transplantation had improved outcomes when compared to patients with postcardiotomy failure. 85

The group at the University of Pittsburgh reported the results of using CentriMag as a temporary RVAD. The indication for RV support was postcardiotomy RV failure in seven (24%), RV failure postcardiac transplant in 10 (35%), and RV failure post-LVAD placement in 12 (41%) patients. The RVAD was able to be weaned in 43% of postcardiotomy patients, 70% of transplant patients, and 58% of LVAD patients after a mean duration of support of 8 days. The authors concluded that the CentriMag was easy to implant, provided effective support, and was easy to wean with low overall morbidity. 86

Lazar and colleagues from the University of Rochester reported 34 patients who required CentriMag RVAD after Heartmate II insertion. The mean duration of biventricular support was 17  $\pm$  11.9 days. Survival to discharge was not statistically different between patients receiving an isolated LVAD (95.2%) and those that required a CentriMag RVAD (88.2%). One-year survival was 87% with LVAD only compared to 77% for those requiring a temporary CentriMag RVAD (p = 0.03) (ATS 2013).87

As with similar pumps, the CentriMag can be configured with an oxygenator to create an ECLS circuit. 88 The group from Penn State compared mechanical pump function between the CentriMag pump and the much less expensive Rotoflow in a mock ECLS loop fitted with the Quadrox D and using blood and found that maximal pump flow and shut off pressure where higher in the Rotoflow than the CentriMag implying better mechanical performance. The authors concluded that it was much more economically prudent to use the Rotaflow system as it was 20 to 30 times less expensive that the CentriMag and demonstrated improved performance. 89

#### **AXIAL FLOW PUMPS**

Impella. The Impella device is a microaxial pump, with both peripheral and central cannulation configurations available. In either case, the pump is directed across the aortic valve into the left ventricle (Fig. 18-8). The cannula portion of the device, which sits across the aortic valve, is contiguous with the integrated motor that comprises the largest diameter section of the catheter. The small diameter of the cannula is designed to allow easy co aptation of the aortic valve leaflets around it, resulting in minimal aortic valve insufficiency. Its hemodynamic support results from the design feature that provides active forward flow that increases net cardiac output, and its ability to address the needs for myocardial protection stems from simultaneously

unloading work from the ventricle (decreasing myocardial oxygen demand) and augmenting coronary flow thereby increasing oxygen supply.<sup>90-92</sup>

Three versions for left ventricular support are available: 2.5 and CP that are inserted percutaneously and a 5.0 version that requires surgical approach for deployment. Typically, the catheter-pump motor is deployed across the aortic valve under fluoroscopic or echocardiographic guidance and blood is aspirated through the distal tip-inlet area from the left ventricle, and pumped into the ascending aorta at the proximal tip-outlet area of the catheter motor. The catheter has pressure transducers on each end, and effectively measures pressures on each side of the aortic valve, making it possible to adjust or reposition the device without need for additional imaging in case of catheter displacement after insertion. The Impella RP is the newest addition with the goal of providing percutaneous support for the failing right ventricle. It is deployed via the femoral vein, across pulmonary valve aspirating blood from inferior vena cava and pumping it into the pulmonary artery (Fig. 18-9). Impella R generates more than 4 L/min of flow and uses a 22F catheter.

Each of the available devices is designed for a particular application depending on the desired flow level. As with all LVADs, the actual flow depends on adequacy of blood return to the left side of the heart, which in return depends on right ventricular function, pulmonary vascular resistance, and adequate blood volume. Impella 2.5 generates up to 2.5 L/min of flow and requires a 12F catheter for insertion. Its use is now typlically reserved for high risk percutaneous catheter-based

![](_page_13_Picture_2.jpeg)

therapies involving coronary interventions or high-risk ablation procedures. 93,94 Impella CP generates up to 4 L/min of flow and requires a 14F catheter for insertion and may be more appropriate for patients in low cardiac output state who need rapid percutaneous stabilization. If time allows for surgical access, the Impella 5.0 which generates up to 5 L/min of flow may be more appropriate. Since this device requires a 21F catheter, surgical cut down to the femoral artery, or more commonly insertion through a vascular graft sewn to the axillary artery is required for placement.

Experience with Impella 2.5 is largely with high-risk percutaneous interventions in which the device maintains hemodynamic stability during balloon inflation and stent deployment. In addition, in cases of MI it may help in reducing infarct size. In a recent prospective randomized trial, 20 patients underwent high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) while being supported with the Impella 2.5.93 All patients had poor LVF and had interventions on the left main or the last remaining patent conduit. Patients with recent STEMI or cardiogenic shock were excluded. The primary safety end point was the incidence of major adverse cardiac events at 30 days. The primary efficacy end point was freedom from hemodynamic compromise during intervention. The Impella 2.5 device was implanted successfully in all patients. The mean duration of circulatory support was  $1.7 \pm 0.6$  hours (range, 0.4-2.5 hours). Mean pump flow during PCI was 2.2 ± 0.3 L/min. At 30 days, the incidence of major adverse cardiac events was 20%. (Two patients had a periprocedural MI, and two patients died at days 12 and 14.) There was no evidence of aortic valve injury, cardiac perforation, or limb ischemia. Two patients (10%) developed mild, transient hemolysis without clinical sequelae. None of the patients developed hemodynamic compromise during

PCI.<sup>93</sup> The more recent follow up to that study, the PRO-TECTII Trial<sup>95</sup> 452 symptomatic patients with complex 3 vessel coronary artery disease or unprotected left main and poor LVF were randomized between IABP (n-226) versus Impella 2.5 (n-226) during percutaneous intervention. Impella 2.5, as expected, provided superior hemodynamic support compared to the IABP during the intervention. However, the 30 day incidence of major adverse event was similar in both groups. Based on a substudy of PROTECT II trial in patients undergoing PCI due to three-vessel disease with impaired LVEF and MCS support, Impella 2.5 had better 90-day outcomes compared to IABP, lower rate of repeating revascularization, less readmissions and adverse events.<sup>96</sup>

Several studies looked at potential survival benefit of Impella systems compared to alternatives in cardiogenic shock. Based on one unadjusted retrospective comparison, there has been no difference in survival between Impella 5.0 and ECMO, while blood transfusion and arterial thrombotic events were more common in the EMCO group.<sup>97</sup> On the other hand, it has been suggested that Impella 5.0 improves survival in postcardiotomy shock patients with residual cardiac output of 1 L/min or more.<sup>98</sup>

Depending on severity, peripheral vascular disease, atherosclerosis, as well as small vessel size, are considered relative contraindications due to risk of leg ischemia, and technical difficulties in catheter placement. 99-103 Other contraindications include mechanical aortic valve, heavily calcified aortic valve, and aortic regurgitation. Some consider aortic regurgitation a relative contraindication emphasizing decreased pump efficacy as the only undesired effect.

Impella RP (Fig. 18-9) is a fairly new addition to the Impella family, with data on its use and performance still being scarce, but highlighting an expanding role of pVADs in right ventricular support. <sup>104,105</sup> Impella RP US clinical trial is currently underway with expected completion date June 2016 (Clinical Trials.gov Identifier: NCT01777607).

## Heartmate PHP<sup>TM</sup>

The Heartmate PHP<sup>TM</sup> (Fig. 18-10) is a microaxial pump similar in concept to the Impella devices. It is designed to be placed through the femoral artery and directed across the aortic valve into the left ventricle. The pump is introduced via a 13-French introducer, which allows for percutaneous insertion. Once the pump is in the left ventricle, the segment of the catheter that houses the pump is unsheathed and expands to 24 Fr. It is then withdrawn so that it straddles the aortic valve. It is marketed as providing 4 to 5 L/min flow. It has recently received CE mark approval and as such is commercially available in Europe.

The SHIELD II (Coronary InterventionS in HIgh-Risk PatiEnts Using a Novel Percutaneous Left Ventricular Support Device) U.S. IDE Clinical Trial is a prospectice, randomized, multi-center, study comparing HeartMate PHP™ (Percutaneous Heart Pump) to the Impella® 2.5 in patients undergoing high-risk PCI. The study will randomize up to 425 patients at up to 60 sites. <sup>106</sup>

# Pulsatile Pumps

#### ABIOMED AB VENTRICLE/AB5000

The AB5000 circulatory support system, introduced in 2004, consists of the pneumatically driven AB ventricle and the AB5000 console, which utilizes vacuum-assisted drainage. The ventricle is designed for short-to-intermediate (<3 months) support and incorporates many of the features of the ABIOCOR total artificial heart. It is driven pneumatically with valves that are constructed of Angioflex, ABIOMED's proprietary polyether-based polyure-thane plastic. Inflow cannulae can be configured for atrial or ventricular placement.

Cannulation. ABIOMED cannulae are constructed from polyvinyl chloride and have a velour body sleeve that is tunneled subcutaneously. Three sizes of wire-reinforced inflow cannulas are available commercially. These include malleable

32-, 36-, and 42-French cannulas. Arterial cannulas have a precoated Dacron graft attached and are available in two sizes: a 10-mm graft for anastomosis to the smaller and lower-resistance pulmonary artery and a 12-mm graft for anastomosis to the ascending aorta.

Careful cannula insertion is important for optimal performance. The combination of the high vacuum setting and smaller cannula size can lead to hemolysis. Optimal cannula placement without chamber collapse or a high-velocity jet at the inflow cannula tip must be confirmed by TEE before leaving the operating room. Anticoagulation to an ACT of 200 seconds is recommended.

Venous inflow must be unimpeded, and outflow grafts must not be kinked. In addition, careful consideration must be given to cannula position when bypass grafts cross the epicardial surface of the heart. Depending on the location of these grafts, these cannulae must be placed such that graft compression cannot occur. The three-dimensional layout of

this geometry must be visualized and thought out in advance, particularly if chest closure is planned. Any graft compression will make recovery unlikely.

It is technically much easier to use cardiopulmonary bypass for placement of these cannulas, although off-pump insertion is possible and may be preferable in certain clinical situations, particularly for isolated right-sided support. A side-biting clamp typically is used on the aorta to perform the outflow anastomosis. If the patient is on cardiopulmonary bypass, the pulmonary artery anastomosis can be done without the need of a partial cross-clamp. The length of the graft is measured from the anticipated skin exit site to the site of anastomosis, and the preclotted Dacron graft is cut to an appropriate length such that there is no excessive tension or any kinking. The cutaneous exit site is planned so that approximately 2 cm of the velour cuff extends from the skin and the remainder is in the subcutaneous tunnel. The cannula is not tunneled subcutaneously until after completion of the anastomosis. For the aortic anastomosis, incorporation of a Teflon or pericardial strip helps to control suture-line bleeding. If an off pump insertion is planned, cannulae must be tunneled before anastomosis.

For atrial cannulation, a double-pledgeted purse string suture using 3-0 polypropylene is placed concentrically. Tourniquets must be secured firmly to prevent inadvertent loosening of the purse string suture and bleeding from the insertion sites. In addition, the heart, generally, is volume loaded to prevent air embolism during insertion.

For pump inflow, the 36-French malleable cannula is typically used because it provides versatility to accommodate variations in anatomy and clinical conditions. Left atrial cannulation can be achieved via the interatrial groove, the dome of the left atrium, or the left atrial appendage. The right atrial appendage provides the most hemostatic way to cannulate the right atrium because securing ligatures can be placed about the appendage and cannula to afford hemostasis. Alternatively, the body of the right ventricle or left ventricular apex may be cannulated. In the absence of left ventricular clot, the cannula can be introduced through a cruciate-shaped ventriculotomy. Ventricular cannulation offers the advantages of excellent ventricular decompression, which may enhance ventricular recovery. Bleeding in the setting of a recent MI is a consideration, but usually is not a problem if careful reinforced sutures are placed. A purse string of 00 polypropylene suture passed through a collar of bovine pericardium is a helpful hemostatic adjunct in particularly friable ventricles. Additionally, a hand-made or preordered chimney made from a preclotted graft sewn to a felt collar facilitates ventricular cannulation. A "top-hat"-type conduit is constructed and with the "brim" sewn to the left ventricle using mattress sutures. A ventriculotomy is made and a cannula is introduced through the conduit. If recovery occurs, the graft can be stapled to achieve hemostasis. It is simply removed and the site closed or converted to a more formal inlet cannulation if a long-term device must be used.

The consoles for the ABIOMED device are relatively simple to operate. The control system automatically adjusts

the duration of pump diastole and systole primarily in response to changes in preload. Pump rate and flow are visible on the display monitor. With the AB5000, console vacuum is adjusted to the lowest possible setting that provides adequate flow.

Complications. A report by Anderson and colleagues looked at the outcomes of patients transferred on the ABIOMED BVS5000, which is no longer being produced, at "spoke" centers and converted to the AB5000 at "hubs." Fifty patients were studied over a 2-year period with a survival to either recovery, transplant, or destination VAD of 42%. <sup>108</sup>

## THORATEC VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICE-TLC

The Thoratec pVAD (Thoratec Laboratories Corp., Pleasanton, CA) was introduced clinically in 1976 under an investigational device exemption and was approved for bridge to heart transplantation in 1995 and postcardiotomy support in 1998, respectively.

The device is a pneumatically driven pulsatile pump that contains two seamless polyurethane bladders within a rigid housing. The inlet and outlet ports contain mono-strut tilting-disk valves to provide unidirectional flow. The effective stroke volume of each prosthetic ventricle is 65 mL. The pneumatic drive console applies alternating negative and positive pressures to fill and empty each prosthetic bladder. Multiple settings can be adjusted to potentially optimize pump filling to provide univentricular (LVAD or RVAD) or biventricular support (BVAD).

Thoratec pumps reside on the upper abdominal wall and are connected to the heart with large wire reinforced cannula. The dual drive console is a large, wheeled pneumatic controller that is used early in the patient's course to optimize VAD parameters. The TLC-II driver is smaller and is approved for out-of-hospital use.

Cannulation. Device implantation typically is performed on cardiopulmonary bypass. It is important to select the cannula position and cutaneous exit sites carefully. The pump should be planned to rest on the anterior abdominal wall. Lateral placement may lead to excessive tension at the skin exit sites and prevent formation of a seal. Approximately 1.5 to 2 cm of the felt covering of the cannulas must extend beyond the skin exit site, with the remainder in the subcutaneous tunnel to promote ingrowth of tissue and create a seal. The distance between the inlet and outlet portion of the pump is 4 cm, and the distance between the inlet and outlet cannulas of the pump should be planned accordingly. The cannulae must be long enough to allow for pump connection but should be trimmed to prevent the pump from kinking when the patient sits.

The arterial cannulas are available with a 14-mm graft (for the pulmonary artery) or an 18-mm graft (for the aorta) and must be cut to length after the appropriate exit site has been selected. They come in two lengths, 15 and 18 cm, which again are selected based on the patient's anatomy and the

planned exit site. The graft is generally sewn on the aorta or pulmonary artery after applying a partial-occluding clamp and sewn with 4-0 polypropylene suture with or without a strip of pericardium or Teflon felt for reinforcement. Inflow can be accomplished by cannulation of the atria or the ventricles. <sup>109</sup> All cannulations generally are reinforced with a double layer of pledgeted concentric purse string sutures. For atrial cannulation, a 51-French right-angled cannula is available in two lengths, 25 and 30 cm. For the left atrium, the cannula is inserted through the atrial appendage, the interatrial groove, or the superior dome of the left atrium. For right atrial cannulation, the cannula is inserted ideally into the right atrial appendage and directed toward the inferior vena cava.

Inflow cannulation of the left ventricle is preferred over left atrial cannulation<sup>109</sup> because it provides better drainage, higher flows, and perhaps improves the chance of myocardial recovery. Left ventricular cannulation also decreases the amount of stasis in the LV in the poorly contractile heart, which decreases thrombus formation. Atrially cannulated patients who develop thrombus are at high risk for thromboembolic complication because the ventricle usually continues to eject. Left ventricular cannulation is achieved by placing a concentric layer of pledgeted horizontal mattress sutures at the apex of the left ventricle or the acute margin of the right ventricle (superior to the posterior descending artery). The previously placed sutures are passed sequentially through the cuff, the apex of the heart is elevated, the left ventricle cored, and the cannula seated. The cannula then is inserted and secured by tying the sutures. The free end can then be directed out through the previously planned cutaneous exit site, and a tubing clamp placed to maintain hemostasis until the pump is connected. Connecting the cannulae to the pump is difficult and must be done with care. The connections to the pump have a sharp, beveled edge that should be directed carefully under gentle pressure to fit the cannulas without damaging the inner surface of the tube. In addition, if this tip bends, it may provide a nidus for thrombus formation. Gentle hand pumping can be performed to ensure complete air evacuation using an aortic vent. De-airing of pVADs is best achieved by keeping the heart full and keeping the pumps full at all time.

Complications. The complications reported for patients bridged to transplantation are similar to those reported for postcardiotomy patients. In a multicenter trial, the most common complications were bleeding in 42%, renal failure in 36%, infection in 36%, neurologic events in 22%, and multisystem organ failure in 16% of patients. Similar complications have been reported from other centers. Similar complications have been reported from other centers.

**Results.** After cardiotomy, results are similar to those obtained with ECLS and the ABIOMED BVS 5000. In a review of 145 patients with nonbridge use of the Thoratec device, 37% were weaned and 21% were discharged. More experienced centers have achieved hospital survival rates of greater than 40%. 111,112

The Thoratec premarket approval experience for the treatment of 53 patients with postcardiotomy heart failure had an in-hospital survival of 28%. The majority of these patients were supported with a BVAD. 110 The Bad Oeynhausen group, however, has reported a 60% survival for postcardiotomy patients supported with the Thoratec device. 111,112

During the era of large pulsatile first-generation VADs, Thoratec pVADs were the main stay of support for smaller individuals needing mechanical support, or for those needing biventricular support as a bridge to transplant. With the advent of smaller continuous flow devises such as the Heart-Ware HVAD that can support smaller patients and that can be configured for biventricular support, the use of the pVAD has wained. However, these devices are still available and approved for mechanical support of both ventricles and for postcardiotomy support.

## **Device Selection**

To date, insufficient data exist to recommend one device over another for patients who require temporary mechanical support. Use of a particular device often is based on availability rather than science.

For centers with multiple devices, patient presentation and cardiopulmonary status determine the device selected. Patients undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation are best served by urgent femoral cannulation. This avoids the time delay of transportation and sternotomy. Patients with severe hypoxia and lung injury either from aspiration or pulmonary edema benefit from the oxygenation and lung rest provided with ECLS. In all ECLS patients, it is important to adequately lower the left atrial pressure, because hypoxia secondary to continued pulmonary venous congestion precludes weaning of the ECLS circuit. Direct venting of the left ventricle is increasing gaining favor as it not only decompresses the pulmonary bed but it also mitigates formation of LVA thrombus.

For postcardiotomy support, typically patients are supported for 48 to 72 hours while transplant evaluation is completed. Then they are transitioned to a more long-term device if myocardial recovery has failed. This approach avoids high-risk emergency heart transplantation and provides the time necessary for improved organ function.

Biventricular support is often required for fulminant myocarditis. Recovery may be possible, but often requires longterm support with a chronic device.

The TandemHeart with percutaneous transseptal left atrial drainage is a very attractive option for patients sustaining arrest in the catheterization laboratory, but required expertise with transeptal techniques. The Cardiohelp, Impella CP, may and Heart mate PHP also has a role to play in this patient population.

# Patient Management

The ultimate goal is to maintain optimal perfusion of all end organs, to allow time for recovery from an acute hemodynamic insult and prevent further deterioration of organ function. Ideally, pump flow would achieve a mixed venous saturation of greater than 70%. Low-flow states can often be corrected by intravascular volume expansion. With centrifugal pumps, speed can be adjusted to control flow and allow some degree of cardiac ejection to decrease the likelihood of stasis and intracardiac thrombus formation. Increasing flow rates by using excessive pump speeds can also cause significant hemolysis. Fluid administration to expand intravascular volume is the best way to increase flow. However, right-sided heart failure also may manifest as a low-flow state in the presence of low pulmonary artery pressures. This condition usually requires the institution of right-sided circulatory support and is associated with a lower overall survival.

#### **VENTILATORY SUPPORT**

Peak inspiratory pressures are maintained below 35-cm  $\rm H_2O$ . Inspired oxygen is set initially at 100% with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5-cm  $\rm H_2O$ . Fractional inspired oxygen then is decreased gradually to less than 50%, with partial pressure of oxygen maintained at between 85 and 100 mm  $\rm Hg$ . These measures are instituted to diminish the deleterious effect of barotrauma and oxygen toxicity in the setting of lung injury.

#### **BLEEDING/ANTICOAGULATION**

Anticoagulation should be done judiciously to weigh the balance of excessive risk of bleeding against clot formation in the pump. Platelet counts decrease within the first 24 hours of support; therefore, counts are monitored every 8 hours, and platelets are transfused to maintain counts above 50,000/ mm<sup>3</sup> during routine support and above 100,000/mm<sup>3</sup> if bleeding is present. Fresh-frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate are given to control coagulopathy and maintain the fibrinogen concentration at greater than 250 mg/dL and also replace other coagulation factors consumed by the circuit. Anticoagulation is achieved by systemic heparinization with a continuous infusion starting at 8 to 10 µg/kg/h and titrated to maintain the partial thromboplastin time at between 45 and 55 seconds once hemostasis is achieved. In most cases, heparin infusion is started within 24 hours if used in the postcardiotomy setting, but sooner in patients without a sternotomy. One must be constantly vigilant for the signs of tamponade, which is heralded by falling pump flows, falling mixed venous saturation, rising filling pressures, and falling hemoglobin. Every effort must be made to alleviate tamponade and achieve hemostasis before transferring a patient. An ambulance is far less suited to the management of tamponade or ongoing hemorrhage than is the operating room. In reality bleeding is far more of a lethal problem in the first days of support than is thromboembolism, and anticoagulation should be used judiciously.

#### FLUID MANAGEMENT

Patients are diuresed aggressively while on support to minimize third-space fluid accumulations. If response to diuretic therapy is suboptimal, we use continuous ultrafiltration or

continuous venovenous hemodialysis. This system permits control over fluid balance that can be adjusted for volume removal and also allows for dialysis as needed.

#### **NEUROLOGIC MONITORING**

Patients are sedated with fentanyl or propofol infusion to maintain comfort. Muscle paralysis is used as needed to decrease the energy expenditure and chest wall stiffness to allow for optimal adjustment of the ventilation parameters. All patients are assessed periodically off sedation to establish neurologic function. Response to simple commands, ability to move all extremities, and spontaneous eye movements are used as gross indications of intact sensorium. A low threshold of obtaining computed tomographic scans of the head is exercised if any change is noted or index of suspicion is high.

#### **WEANING**

A weaning trial is usually attempted after 48 to 72 hours of support. It is critical not to rush weaning and to allow time for myocardial as well as end-organ recovery. The principle of weaning is common to all devices, and all have various controls available that allow reduction in flow, thereby enabling more work to be performed by the heart. Flow is reduced gradually at increments of 0.5 to 1 L/min. Adequate anticoagulation is critical during this low-flow phase to prevent pump thrombosis, and, in general, it is not recommended to reduce flow to less than 2.0 L/min for a prolonged period. We add additional heparin during this period to maintain an ACT of more than 300 seconds. With optimal pharmacologic support and continuous TEE evaluation of ventricular function, flows are reduced while monitoring systemic blood pressure, cardiac index, pulmonary pressures, and ventricular size. Maintenance of cardiac index and low pulmonary pressures with preserved LVF by echocardiography suggests that weaning is likely. A weaning failure manifests as a falling systemic blood pressure along with a drop in cardiac output and rising pulmonary artery pressures. A failed attempt at weaning should result in resumption of full flow. Absence of ventricular recovery after several weaning attempts is a poor prognostic sign. Patients who are transplant candidates undergo a full evaluation and subsequently are staged to a long-term ventricular assist device as a bridge to cardiac transplantation. We and others have found that early conversion to chronic ventricular support is beneficial and improves the low survival that is associated with cardiogenic shock, particularly in the postcardiotomy setting.

#### CONCLUSION

Currently a number of options exist for temporary circulatory support, and with advances in technology, the number of devices will expand. Each device has advantages and disadvantages, and to date, none satisfies all the requirements of an ideal device. We have clearly learned many lessons that should direct the development of systems and strategies that maximize survival and reduce complications. In this arena, better understanding of the host inflammatory response,

appreciation of the induced derangement in the coagulation cascade, and development of systems that do not require anticoagulation should improve overall outcomes. In addition, development of therapies that alter reperfusion injury and preserve organ function is important.

Risk analysis also has taught us that patients requiring postcardiotomy support generally fit into a particular profile. Specifically, these are patients who require emergency operations, have poor ventricular reserve, are older, and have extensive atherosclerotic coronary disease and preexisting renal dysfunction. Preoperative awareness should prompt maximization of medical pharmacologic support and a readiness to implement mechanical devices early in the face of cardiac pump failure.

Use of the standard centrifugal pump gradually has fallen out of favor. Use of the Thoratec pVAD has also waned with the emergence of less morbid and more patient-friendly longterm pumps. Traditional ECLS/ECMO has seen a resurgence with smaller more compact systems like the Cardiohelp device. Other centers effectively utilize acute support devices such as the TandemHeart and CentriMag or Impella 5.0. Traditionally, transplantation after transition to long-term LVADs has been the only therapy available for patients supported with acute support devices who have not manifested recovery. Recently improved results have been reported with the use of a continuous-flow pump in stage D heart failure patients who are not transplant candidates. 113 Historically salvage rates for patients in cardiogenic shock, transitioned to destination VADs have been poor, given that typically DT patients are older with more comorbid conditions than patients being bridged to transplantation. 114 Hopefully earlier use of more effective and less morbid acute support devices can improve results in this population.

Recently a consensus statement on the use of percutaneous support devices was generated by both surgical and cardiology authors representing several societies.<sup>3</sup> The take home message of this important manuscript is that patients with cardiogenic shock represent a multidisciplinary challenge and acute support devices play an ever increasing role in the care of these critically ill patients.
