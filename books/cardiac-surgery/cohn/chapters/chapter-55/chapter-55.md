# Surgical Implantation of Pacemakers and Automatic Defibrillators

Henry M. Spotnitz • Michelle D. Spotnitz

Pacemaker and defibrillator management is the subject of comprehensive reviews. <sup>1-8</sup> The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of pacemakers are widely accepted, but the appropriate role for ICD insertion <sup>7</sup> and biventricular pacing <sup>5</sup> in older patients is still in evolution. Pacemaker and ICD technology are now applicable across the entire span of human age. Pacing for heart failure and ICD prophylaxis against lethal arrhythmias are recent frontiers. Electrophysiologists dominate these areas, reflecting decreased interest by thoracic surgeons and cardiology referral patterns. However, thoracic surgeons must maintain skills as implanters in order to serve as consultants or surgeons for complex or complicated cases. This chapter reviews practical information related to pacemaker and ICD insertion and management.

A permanent pacemaker or ICD consists of leads and a generator.<sup>2</sup> The generator consists of a battery, a telemetry antenna, and integrated circuits. ICDs also include capacitors that store energy for high-output shocks. The power source is generally lithium iodide, but rechargeable and nuclear batteries have been used. The integrated circuits include programmable microprocessors, oscillators, amplifiers, and sensing circuits.<sup>2</sup> The integrated circuits employ complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, which is subject to damage by ionizing radiation. Current pacemakers and ICDs monitor and report the status of internal components, external connections, programmed settings, recent activity, and notable arrhythmias. Unfortunately, each programmer controls only the devices of its manufacturer.<sup>4</sup> Pacing systems compatible with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)<sup>2</sup> and wireless ICDs and pacemakers are now available, and wireless telemetry is available for remote follow-up.4

# PACEMAKERS FOR CONTROL OF BRADYCARDIA

# History

Early cardiac surgery was complicated by lethal iatrogenic heart block. Transthoracic pacing with Zoll cutaneous electrodes provided an early solution. Percutaneous

endocardial pacing (1959) and "permanent" pacemakers using epicardial electrodes (1960) followed. Ensuing advances in bioengineering and technology have dramatically improved the quality of life for recipients. Persistent problems include lead durability, inflammatory responses to pacemaker materials, infection, device size, programmer compatibility, battery life, periodic battery replacement, and expense. *Cardiac resynchronization therapy* (CRT) for heart failure has made coronary sinus (CS) lead insertion an important technical skill.

# Anatomy of Surgical Heart Block

The conduction system is vulnerable to injury during heart surgery. Complete heart block can result from suture placement during aortic, mitral, or tricuspid valve surgery, septal defect closure, or from myotomy for idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis. These lesions are mapped in Fig. 55-1. Infarction/abscess of the conduction system, inadequate myocardial protection, or trauma from retraction can also result in surgical heart block.

#### International Pacemaker Code

A three-letter code describes the principal pacemaker functions (Table 55-1). The first letter is the chamber paced, the second the chamber sensed, and the third the algorithm integrating pacing and sensing functions. Fixed-rate ventricular and atrial pacemakers are VOO and AOO, respectively. Demand (rate-inhibited) pacers for the same chambers are VVI and AAI. VDD pacemakers pace only the ventricle but sense both atrium and ventricle. DVI indicates atrial and ventricular pacing, but only ventricular sensing. DDD is the most flexible of current designs. The suffix R after the three-letter code indicates rate responsiveness. Pacemakers capable of biventricular pacing or CRT are referred to as *CRT-P*. Biventricular pacemaker-defibrillators are called *CRT-D*.8

# Cellular Electrophysiology

Cell membrane depolarization and repolarization provide automaticity of the cardiac chambers and conduction system. The outside of the resting myocardial cell is positive, and the interior is negative. Unipolar pacing threshold is lowest when the negative terminal (cathode) of a pacemaker

is connected to the heart and the positive terminal (anode) is connected to ground. Electrogram amplitude is unaffected by polarity.<sup>2</sup>

# **Rhythm Disorders**

#### INDICATIONS FOR PACEMAKER INSERTION

Pacemaker insertion guidelines (Table 55-2) are periodically updated. In 2008, an American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association/North American Society for Pacing and Electrophysiology (ACC/AHA/NASPE) task force revised recommendations for pacemaker and ICD insertion, further updated in 2013.<sup>11</sup> Any practitioner who implants arrhythmia control devices should be familiar with these guidelines. Documentation is required for billing and can be an important medical-legal issue.

Indication categories are "accepted (Class I)," "controversial (Class II)," or "not warranted (Class III)." Evidence from large randomized clinical trials is designated level A, from less stringent trials or registries, level B, and from consensus, level C. Profound sinus bradycardia or symptomatic second-

third-degree heart block indicates pacemaker insertion. Sinus bradycardia justifies pacemaker insertion if simultaneous symptoms are documented by Holter or other means. Pacemakers may be appropriate for bradycardia less than 40 bpm if long-term drug therapy is necessary for supraventricular arrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia (VT), hypertension, or angina. Although new indications for arrhythmia control devices may be supported by clinical research, certification of advances by the Food and Drug Administration, insurance carriers, and regulatory agencies is often slow. Electrophysiology (EP) studies help define proper treatment.<sup>3,11</sup>

#### ATRIOVENTRICULAR BLOCK

First-degree block is prolongation of the P-R interval beyond 200 ms. First-degree block at a low atrial rate may progress to Wenckebach as the atrial rate increases. Seconddegree block is incomplete dissociation of the atrial and ventricular rates, either with increasing P-R intervals and dropped beats (Wenckebach and Mobitz I, usually atrioventricular (AV) nodal block), or frequently dropped beats without progression of the P-R interval (Mobitz II, usually in the His-Purkinje system).3 Third-degree block is complete AV dissociation, the atrial rate usually exceeding the ventricular rate. Left and right bundle-branch blocks and left anterior and posterior hemiblocks are partial conduction system blocks detected by electrocardiogram (ECG). Etiologies of AV block include ischemic injury, idiopathic fibrosis, cardiomyopathy, iatrogenic injury, AV node ablation, Lyme disease, abscess in bacterial endocarditis, and congenital lesions related to maternal lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases.3

#### SINUS NODE DYSFUNCTION

Sinus node dysfunction is an intrinsic disease that can be accentuated by drugs required for ancillary conditions. The role for pacing depends on symptoms. Sinus node dysfunction is caused by coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, and reflex abnormalities.3

Reflex problems include carotid sinus hypersensitivity, vasovagal syncope, and oddities including micturitioninduced and deglutition syncope. Cardioinhibitory (asystole >3 seconds) and vasodepressor (marked fall in blood pressure despite adequate heart rate) components of reflex-mediated syncope are recognized. Medical therapy is favored for vasodepressor syncope. Tilt table testing provides objective data.3,12,13 Decisions on pacemaker insertion are based on symptoms and the duration of asystole. Pacemaker insertion is recommended for asystolic intervals greater than 3 seconds. Dual-chamber pacing (DDD or VDD) is favored for these patients, because AV synchrony increases stroke volume and decreases symptoms.3,14

# Features of Permanent Pacing

#### **DUAL-CHAMBER PACING AND** ATRIOVENTRICULAR SYNCHRONY

In the normal heart, stroke volume is increased 5 to 15% by AV synchrony versus asynchrony.<sup>8,14</sup> Left ventricular hypertrophy, decreased diastolic compliance, and heart failure increase the quantitative importance of AV synchrony.<sup>8,14</sup> Pacing of the right ventricular apex disrupts the normal sequence of activation because depolarization spreads more slowly over the ventricular myocardium than through the conduction system.8,14

Recent experience emphasizes clinical relevance of the sequence of activation. Right ventricular outflow tract pacing may improve stroke volume versus apical pacing because of favorable effects on the activation sequence.<sup>15</sup> Disruption of activation sequence by DDD pacing reduces the ventricular-aortic gradient in some patients with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis. <sup>16,17</sup> Biventricular (right ventricle [RV] apex and CS) pacing in patients with advanced cardiomyopathy and an intraventricular conduction defect improves left ventricular function by restoring simultaneous contraction of the septum and free wall, also known as cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). <sup>5,18</sup> Single-site, epicardial left ventricular pacing may provide similar benefits. <sup>18</sup> For temporary pacing in postoperative heart block, biventricular pacing is superior to right ventricular pacing <sup>18</sup> and may be useful for left ventricular dysfunction after cardiac surgery. Clinical trials suggest that biventricular pacing is superior to standard pacing for heart block. <sup>8</sup>

#### **DUAL-CHAMBER PACING ALGORITHM**

DDD pacemaker programming includes a lower rate, an upper rate, and AV delay. When the intrinsic atrial rate is between the upper and lower rate limits, the pacemaker tracks the atrium to maintain a 1:1 response between the right atrium and right ventricle. If the atrial rate falls to or below the lower rate limit, the atrium is paced at the lower rate limit. If the atrial rate exceeds the upper rate limit, the ventricle is paced at the upper rate limit with loss of AV synchrony, resembling a Wenckebach effect. If the patient develops atrial fibrillation, mode switching converts the pacing algorithm to VVI or VVI(R) at the lower rate limit.

Programmable AV delay defines the interval allowed between atrial and ventricular depolarization. Timing starts with the atrial electrogram or pacing stimulus and continues until the AV delay elapses. If no ventricular depolarization is detected during the delay, the ventricle is paced. *Atrial latency*, a varying delay between the atrial pacing artifact and the P wave, requires different AV delays for atrial sensing versus pacing.<sup>4</sup>

# RATE RESPONSE TO INCREASED METABOLIC DEMAND

During high metabolic demand, cardiac output is augmented by increased ventricular contractility, venous return, and heart rate. In patients with heart block and a normal sinus exercise response, dual-chamber pacing maintains both AV synchrony and a physiologic rate response.8 However, sinus node incompetence (no atrial rate increase with exercise) or single-chamber ventricular (VVI) pacemakers require alternate mechanisms for rate response. The letter R after the three-letter pacemaker code indicates rate responsive capability. If a sensor detects increased metabolic demand, the lower rate of the pacemaker increases within a programmable range. Body vibration or respiratory rate<sup>8,19,20</sup> is commonly employed to estimate demand. Other indicators are body temperature, venous oxygen saturation, QT interval, right ventricular systolic pressure, and right ventricular stroke volume. All such indicators can aberrantly increase heart rate, for example, during a bumpy car ride. Patients with sedentary life styles do not benefit from rate-responsive pacing. Adverse results of fast heart rates can include angina or infarction in patients with coronary disease.

#### CHOICE OF PACING TECHNIQUE

Dual-chamber pacing has become the standard of care, except in chronic atrial fibrillation. Sinus rhythm appears to be better maintained by atrial than ventricular pacing, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, previously problematic for DDD pacemakers, is now well handled by mode switching. Advantages of dual-chamber pacing in reflex-mediated syncope with cardioinhibitory features have also been reported. Dual-chamber pacing may not be warranted in elderly patients, except when pacemaker syndrome, hypertension, or congestive heart failure is present. VVI or VVIR pacing is appropriate for patients with bradycardia and chronic atrial fibrillation. AAIR is useful for cardiac allograft recipients with sinus arrest or sinus bradycardia. Biventricular pacing using an endocardial CS lead is recommended for symptomatic heart failure.<sup>8</sup>

# Pacemaker Technology

#### EPICARDIAL VERSUS ENDOCARDIAL LEADS

Epicardial leads are generally inferior to endocardial leads in electrical characteristics and are prone to conductor fractures.<sup>2</sup> Steroid-eluting tips and small contact surfaces have improved epicardial leads. Epicardial pacing is more difficult at reoperative cardiac surgery, where epicardial fibrosis elevates pacing thresholds. Infected epicardial leads must be removed by thoracotomy. The epicardial approach is preferred in patients with congenital septal defects, single ventricle physiology, mechanical tricuspid valves, or venous thrombosis/occlusion.<sup>21</sup> During thoracotomy, insertion of endocardial leads through an atrial pursestring is a useful option.<sup>22</sup> Epicardial left ventricular pacing by the minimal access approach is increasing in importance, driven by a 5 to 10% technical failure rate for CS lead insertion. Approaches to DDD pacing during open-heart surgery are illustrated in Fig. 55-2. Fixed-screw, positive fixation leads are introduced via atrial pursestrings and fixed into position by axial rotation. When a tricuspid prosthesis or ring is to be inserted, a ventricular lead can be passed between the sutures securing the ring or the valve.

#### UNIPOLAR VERSUS BIPOLAR

Bipolar leads incorporate two insulated conductors. In unipolar systems, the patient's body is the second (anodal) conductor; a single conductor in the lead carries the negative current to the heart. Bipolar leads reduce electrical noise (oversensing) and adventitious pacing of the diaphragm or chest wall. These advantages are offset by increased engineering complexity. Bipolar leads historically were prone to breakdown of insulation or conductor fracture. This would compromise sensing, pacing, or both (Fig. 55-3). Recent bipolar leads are much improved and similar in dimensions and handling to unipolar leads (Figs. 55-4 and 55-5).<sup>2</sup> Technical failures of some new technology pacemaker and ICD leads emphasize the importance of advanced lead extraction.<sup>6</sup>

#### LEAD FIXATION

We prefer endocardial positive fixation leads, particularly in chambers with sparse trabeculation. A small wire spiral or screw holds these leads in place (Fig. 55-5G). In designs with fixed, extended screws, a soluble coating over the tip promotes venous passage. In retractable screw designs (Bisping), extension/retraction is accomplished by rotation of the pin at the lead tip. Axial clockwise rotation of screw-in leads during fixation provides tactile feedback on the firmness and security of attachment. Lead impedance provides feedback on the adequacy of tip extension and fixation.

Tined leads use miniature anchors to secure the lead tip within myocardial trabeculae (Fig. 55-5A). Tines require larger introducers than screw-in leads and are not secure in smooth-walled or dilated chambers. Nevertheless, some physicians prefer these leads.<sup>2</sup>

# **Temporary Pacing**

Acute bradycardia can be treated with transthoracic pacing, temporary endocardial pacing, or chronotropic drugs, including atropine, dobutamine, or isoproterenol. Right ventricular

perforation has become less prevalent with current temporary endocardial leads but must be borne in mind if hypotension develops acutely after removal of temporary wires.

Bradycardia after cardiac surgery is commonly treated with pacing via temporary atrial and ventricular epicardial wires. Problems include unfavorable evolution of right atrial (RA) or right ventricular thresholds and RA sensing. Atrial undersensing and pacemaker competition can precipitate atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. If atrial sensing is not adequate, overdriving the atrium faster than the intrinsic rate can ameliorate competition. Reversing polarity or inserting a cutaneous ground wire under local anesthesia can improve pacing threshold. The output of the temporary pacemaker in volts or milliamps should be at least twice the threshold and should be measured daily. Ventricular undersensing in critically ill patients can result in pacing during the vulnerable period, which can precipitate VT or fibrillation.

#### CARDIAC OUTPUT AND PACING RATE

For patients with hemodynamic compromise following cardiac surgery, optimization of pacing rate and AV delay can affect hemodynamics by compensating for valve leaks or fixed stroke volume. Mean arterial pressure reflects cardiac output if systemic resistance is constant. Rate and timing adjustments over intervals of less than 20 seconds minimize reflex effects. Settings producing the highest sustained mean arterial pressure should also maximize cardiac output.

#### Pacemaker Insertion

#### **ENVIRONMENT AND ANESTHESIA**

Pacemaker and ICD surgery are now predominantly performed in EP laboratories. Whether in the operating room or EP laboratory, properly functioning equipment is essential. Infection control is critical<sup>23</sup>; operating room standards for air quality should be enforced. Problems calling for presence of an anesthesiologist include angina, transient cerebral ischemia, patient disorientation, lidocaine toxicity, dementia, myocardial ischemia, heart failure, anxiety, or VT. If English is not the patient's first language, a translator is helpful. Vancomycin reactions (red man syndrome), pacing-induced ventricular fibrillation (VF), air embolism, and Stokes-Adams attacks are rare emergencies that are less problematic if considered in advance. Intraoperative death can occur because of hemorrhage, pericardial tamponade, VF, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and other causes.

#### MONITORING

R-wave detection by an ECG monitor is inadequate for pacemaker insertion, because pacing artifacts may trigger the monitor but fail to capture. Thus, subthreshold pacing can elicit regular beeping from the monitor in an asystolic patient. Oxygen saturation monitors are optimal and beep only during blood flow. Pulse oximeters should not be placed on the same extremity as the blood pressure cuff. When monitors are unreliable, palpation by an anesthesiologist or nurse

of the temporal, facial, or radial artery pulse can detect asystole before the patient becomes symptomatic.

#### **VENOUS ACCESS STRATEGY**

Choices include which side to be employed and whether to use cutdown or percutaneous venipuncture. Approaches to the cephalic, subclavian, axillary, external jugular, and internal jugular system are useful.<sup>6</sup> Anatomical considerations<sup>24</sup> may reduce the frequency of subclavian crush (Fig. 55-6). Deep vein punctures are associated with an apparently unavoidable but low incidence of pneumothorax, hemothorax, and major venous injury. Contrast injection from an IV on the side of the implant can confirm patency and location of the target vein. Ultrasonic vessel locators may further reduce the frequency of injury.

Venous access is problematic in superior vena cava syndrome or subclavian/innominate vein obstruction/thrombosis (eg, with chronic dialysis, mediastinal tracheostomy, or multiple

pacemaker leads). Access from below or transhepatically is possible,<sup>6</sup> but potential for bleeding, venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism are concerns. Right parasternal mediastinotomy with exposure of the right atrium and a Seldinger approach with small introducers and atrial pursestring sutures are useful in difficult cases<sup>22</sup> (Fig. 55-7). Lead extraction may permit reinsertion of leads via the extraction cannula.<sup>6</sup>

#### ANTIBIOTIC PROPHYLAXIS

Antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated for insertion of a prosthetic device. 6.23 We have used 1 g of intravenous cefazolin, but the current recommendation is 2 g. We also irrigate the operative field with a solution of 1 g of cefazolin in a liter of warm saline. Patients with prosthetic valves or a penicillin or cefazolin allergy receive vancomycin (500–1000 mg) and gentamicin (1 mg/kg). Doses are adjusted for renal function.

#### PACING SYSTEMS ANALYZER

Pacing thresholds and electrogram amplitudes are measured with a pacing systems analyzer. Electrogram characteristics and slew rate can be assessed, and electrogram telemetry is available from most current pacemakers. Analyzers must be serviced and tested periodically, including batteries. Any discrepancies between measurements by the analyzer and the pacemaker should be noted and related functions of the analyzer rechecked.

A skilled operator is needed to run the analyzer and record the results. If placed in a sterile bag, the analyzer can be operated by the surgeon. Manufacturer's representatives, an increasing intraoperative presence, are skilled in operation of these analyzers.

#### **CABLES**

The cables connecting the analyzer to the leads are the patient's lifeline. Even with excellent quality control, cables with open or reversed connections may be delivered to the surgical field. Errors can also occur in connecting the cables to the analyzer. Routine testing of the cables and the integrity of their connections is recommended. After passing the cables from the operating table, pacing is initiated from the analyzer at 5-V output. The connectors are then briefly touched to the subcutaneous tissue, with caution to minimize inhibition of the permanent pacemaker. Current measured in the analyzer should rise to 300 to 1000 ohms. If impedance is more than 5000 ohms, the circuit is faulty. The operation should not proceed until the problem is corrected, if impedance indicates the analyzer-cable circuit is defective. Connections to the analyzer should also be checked, because inadvertent reversal of polarity can make measured pacing thresholds inappropriately high. Disposable leads with polarized connectors have been delivered to us on occasion with the connectors reversed.

#### **FLUOROSCOPY**

Fluoroscopy is essential for transvenous device implantation, and personnel must be familiar with the equipment. Distracting problems with image orientation, rebooting, timers, brakes, and locks can be avoided by a knowledgeable team. Sudden failure of fluoroscopy at a critical point can occur. If a backup unit is not available, the options include "blind" endocardial lead insertion, epicardial insertion, or postponing the procedure. The use of low-dose and pulsed image options can prevent overheating of the fluoroscope, although image quality may be compromised. Radiation exposure or fluoroscopy time should be monitored and recorded.<sup>6</sup>

#### SURGICAL APPROACH

For routine implants, we prefer to approach from the patient's left. The fluoroscope is positioned carefully on the right to allow visualization of the apex, right atrium, and deltopectoral groove. The right arm is extended rightward on an arm board. The drapes are suspended from IV poles. The right-sided pole is caudad to the arm board. Proper positioning exposes the left clavicular region while leaving the patient adequate light and air. After skin preparation, towels aligned with the deltopectoral groove and clavicle define essential landmarks. Conscious sedation with 0.5 mg midalozam and/or 25.0 mcg of fentanyl may be useful. The region of the incision and underlying generator is infiltrated with 1% lidocaine, producing a field block. A 5- to 6-cm horizontal incision is created 4 cm beneath the clavicle, the lateral extent of the incision just reaching the deltopectoral groove. This allows the generator

to be positioned away from the groove and axilla, avoiding interference with motion of the left arm at the shoulder. An alternate incision overlying the deltopectoral groove is preferred for exposure of the cephalic vein in obese patients or elderly patients with atretic veins.

#### **VENOUS ACCESS**

When the deltopectoral groove is exposed, additional anesthetic is infiltrated into the lateral margin of the pectoralis and laterally into the deltoid. The dissection proceeds into the deltopectoral groove, following the lateral edge of the pectoralis, until the cephalic vein or another venous branch

is exposed. Failure to find a vein may mean the incision is too far cephalad or caudad or not lateral enough. The incision can be deepened into the subpectoral fat if necessary. If the vein is too small to pass a pacemaker lead, the curved end of the guidewire for a 7-French introducer is passed centrally. The ability to manually stiffen and extend the curve by manipulation of the tension in the guidewire is an important technical aid in tortuous veins. Hydrophilic guidewires are also useful. The method illustrated in Fig. 55-8 can be used to dilate the vein. A no. 18 Angiocath is advanced over the guidewire, and the vein is slit longitudinally, exposing larger segments more proximally. This step can be repeated until a 7 French introducer will enter the vein. If the introducer

**FIGURE 55-8** Cephalic cutdown approach to small veins passing a guidewire centrally but blocking an introducer. Resistance is from entrapment of the introducer tip and inversion of the vein. This entrapment can be harnessed to split the vein. After the guidewire is advanced (C), pass a no. 18 Angiocath over the guidewire and incise the vein longitudinally (not shown). This allows the introducer tip to enter the vein (D). If the vein does not split, the introducer becomes impaled and will not advance (E). Partially pull the introducer back, stretching the impaled vein (F). Incise the exposed vein segment longitudinally with a no. 11 blade (G). Steps (D) to (G) can be repeated, if necessary, until the introducer advances centrally. A pursestring suture approximates soft tissue around the path of the introducer to achieve hemostasis (H, I).

will not advance without invaginating the vein, pulling the introducer back exposes the impaled vein, which can again be longitudinally incised to allow the introducer to advance. If dual-chamber pacing is planned, a guidewire should be reinserted before the introducer is stripped away. These steps provide venous access for the duration of the procedure. <sup>25,26</sup> A pursestring suture in the muscle controls bleeding and stabilizes the lead(s). <sup>27</sup> Ultrasonic localizers may be useful at this stage, with appropriate sterile precautions. If a guidewire will not pass centrally, a no. 18 Angiocath can be advanced for angiography with iodinated contrast. Venography reduces the risk of hemo/pneumothorax during needle puncture.

#### RIGHT VENTRICULAR LEAD INSERTION

From the patient's left, a gentle spiral in the distal 10 cm of the stylet will guide the lead toward the tricuspid valve, right ventricle, and pulmonary artery. Advancing the lead into the pulmonary artery outside the cardiac silhouette confirms that the lead is not in the CS. For fixed-screw positive fixation leads, withdrawing the stylet 3 to 5 cm minimizes the risk of apical perforation while the lead tip is screwed into the myocardium with axial clockwise rotation. Reverse torque developing as the lead is rotated indicates the tip is in healthy myocardium and is an index of the security of fixation. We fix these leads with three consecutive 360-degree clockwise rotations of the lead shaft, and then the torque is released. This fixation sequence is repeated if necessary, until the lead is secure, with substantial reverse torque after the first 360-degree rotation. No more than three complete axial rotations are employed in any sequence. A potential problem with screw-in leads is ventricular perforation. The lead tip should be imaged during fixation looking for extra-anatomical passage along the edge of the cardiac silhouette and around the apex, tracking cephalad. If this happens, the lead should be withdrawn and repositioned. An echocardiogram should be obtained and the patient monitored for tamponade.

When the lead tip has been properly positioned, the stylet is withdrawn and thresholds are tested. Patient hyperventilation and coughing confirms fixation. The ventricular pacing threshold should be less than  $0.7~\rm V$ , with R-wave amplitude more than  $5~\rm mV$ , and impedance  $400~\rm to~1000~\rm ohms$ , depending on lead design. There should be no diaphragmatic pacing at an output of  $10~\rm V$ .

If the lead is dislodged by hyperventilation and coughing, or thresholds are not adequate, the lead should be repositioned. A positive fixation lead can be unscrewed by counterclockwise axial rotation until it floats free. Positive fixation leads can be secured almost anywhere along the margins of the right ventricular silhouette (Fig. 55-9), including the right ventricular outflow tract (Fig. 55-10).<sup>28</sup> In difficult cases, we have relocated leads as many as 15 times. The geographic center of the right ventricular silhouette is not a desirable location, as it can lead to entanglement of the lead in the chordae tendineae (see Fig. 55-9).

#### **CORONARY SINUS LEAD INSERTION**

Left ventricular pacing via the CS is a valued skill since the MIRACLE trial and subsequent studies indicated that CRT

reduces symptoms of heart failure and mortality of dilated cardiomyopathy.<sup>5</sup> Electrophysiologists are familiar with CS entry for arrhythmia mapping; steerable mapping catheters and biplane fluoroscopy are important tools. However, the technical failure rate of CS lead insertion is 5 to 10%.<sup>5,29</sup> The CS orifice is usually a posterior structure near the caudal aspect of the tricuspid valve (Fig. 55-11). Locating the os in heart failure patients may be difficult, because the CS can be angulated and distorted as a result of cardiac enlargement. Transesophageal echocardiography and venography may help locate the os. CRT candidates may be prone to ventricular arrhythmias, and

rapid defibrillation capability is desirable. Even experienced operators may require hours to insert a CS lead with present methods, although technology for both endocardial and epicardial left ventricular lead placement is improving. Over-thewire lead designs are the most successful.

We prefer to insert the CS lead first via the cephalic approach, RA and right ventricular lead insertion after via subclavian puncture. CS lead insertion involves advancing an angled cannula into the CS, followed by CS venography and lead insertion through the cannula into a lateral CS branch. The CS cannula is then removed and stripped away without dislodging the lead. Positive fixation leads are not available. A large selection of angled CS cannulas, steerable probes, and lead designs testifies to the technical challenge. The difficulty of CS lead insertion in heart failure patients should not be underestimated; special training is desirable. Recent availability of multielectrode CS leads is very helpful in preventing phrenic nerve pacing, a complication that can be minimized by high output test pacing.

#### LENGTH ADJUSTMENT

If lead length is "too short," flattening of the diaphragm during a deep breath can result in lead displacement, if "too long," a cough can force intracardiac loops that effectively shorten the lead, also potentially causing displacement. Hyperventilation by the patient under fluoroscopy helps adjust length. Vigorous coughing tests the security of lead tip fixation. This valuable feedback is lost if sedation is excessive. Minimizing sedation also promotes early detection of pacemaker syndrome.

#### ATRIAL LEAD INSERTION

For dual-chamber pacing, the atrial lead is introduced last. A J or S stylet shape is best for finding the atrial appendage from the left side. The S shape is also useful for passing a positive fixation

lead to the right margin of the atrium near the junction of the atrium and inferior vena cava (Fig. 55-12). P-wave amplitude is often best in this location. The atrial pacing threshold should be less than 2 V. In the presence of complete heart block, it may

**FIGURE 55-12** DDD pacemaker with atrial lead in low right atrium, advantageous after obliteration of the atrial appendage at heart surgery. This location, which requires positive fixation leads, often provides good P-wave amplitude when other sites fail. Phrenic nerve pacing must be excluded with 10-V pacing at this location.

be difficult to confirm atrial capture from the surface ECG. Pacing the atrium at 150 bpm results in rapid oscillation of the lead tip, which is visible fluoroscopically if mechanical function of the atrium is sufficient. Lead oscillation may thus be used to determine the atrial pacing threshold. This technique should only be used if the high atrial rate is not conducted to the ventricle. In patients with complete heart block, high-output atrial pacing can inhibit whatever temporary VVI pacing is supporting the patient, resulting in asystole.

The P-wave electrogram is the Achilles heel of dual-chamber pacing. If atrial sensing is not satisfactory, a DDD pacemaker will not function properly. The P-wave amplitude should ideally be greater than 2 mV. P-wave amplitude may vary during respiration, and the minimum value, not the maximum, determines the adequacy of sensing. P-wave amplitude is generally reduced during atrial fibrillation versus values in sinus rhythm.

Measurement of P-wave amplitude with unipolar leads can be confusing. Crosstalk or far-field sensing of ventricular depolarization from the atrial lead can occur, so that the signal measured through a pacemaker analyzer is not the P wave but the QRS complex. Simultaneous measurement and display of atrial and ventricular electrograms as well as the surface ECG can resolve this.

Atrial and ventricular electrogram telemetry provide valuable data. For example, inability to pace the atrium or to record atrial electrograms may indicate low-amplitude atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia invisible on the surface ECG but detectable in electrograms. Electrogram telemetry can confirm proper DDD pacing (Fig. 55-13).

#### **GENERATOR LOCATION**

We use a watertight, three-layer skin closure for primary implants, three layers in generator replacements. Dermabond can be used for skin closure. Cosmetic appearance is important, and technique is critical to optimize healing. Past injury to the chest wall or surgery/ radiotherapy for breast cancer can present a formidable technical problem. Bipolar systems facilitate optional generator placement behind the

Regular atrial depolarizations appear (AS) at a rate of 160 bpm. The pacemaker paces the ventricle (VP) at 80 bpm, because alternate P waves fall inside the postventricular atrial refractory period and are not detected. The circles illustrate far-field sensing of the RV pacing artifact in the RA lead. The SVT was not detected preoperatively.

pectoralis or inside the rectus sheath. Diminutive generators are available, but battery life is reduced. Innovative locations for pacemaker generators include axillary, retromammary, intrathoracic, intra-abdominal, and preperitoneal sites. These approaches are rarely indicated with present generator designs. Temporary endocardial pacing wires are removed under fluoroscopy, watching carefully for displacement of the new permanent leads.

# Length of Stay after Pacemaker Implantation

#### AMBULATORY SURGERY

Same-day hospital discharge after pacemaker insertion is reasonable in patients who have an adequate escape rhythm and positive fixation leads. After monitoring and recovery from sedation, patients are ambulated and shown range of motion exercises for the shoulder. A chest x-ray documents lead position and rules out hemothorax, pneumothorax, or increasing heart size.

#### PACEMAKER-DEPENDENT PATIENTS

Lead displacement can result from technical error, struggling of demented patients, and other factors. A small percentage of lead displacement is probably unavoidable. Gast Patients who might suffer death or injury in the event of pacemaker failure should be observed in the hospital overnight on telemetry. However, lead displacement in our ambulatory patients has not been more frequent than in hospitalized patients. Swan-Ganz catheter removal/insertion, endomyocardial biopsy, or cardiac catheterization can displace pacemaker leads, requiring a backup pacing plan.

# Pacemaker Generator Replacement

#### **PLANNING**

Complications of pacemaker generator replacement include infection, lead damage, connector problems, and asystole during the transition from the old generator to the new. Pacemaker independence at the time of initial pacemaker implant may progress to total pacemaker dependence by the time of generator replacement. Ambulatory surgery is common. As a practical matter, we do not completely reverse warfarin for pacemaker generator replacement unless lead replacement is expected.<sup>31</sup> Patients with leads more than 10 years old should be carefully evaluated for pacemaker dysfunction before the procedure; a Holter monitor should be obtained if lead dysfunction is suspected. Rising pacing threshold may indicate impending lead failure. The possibility of unexpected lead replacement should be discussed with the patient in advance.

#### **BACKUP PACING**

A backup temporary transvenous pacing wire can be inserted for pacemaker generator replacement, but this is rarely necessary. The output of the replacement unit must be higher than

the threshold of the chronically implanted leads. This can be problematic if the expiring generator is an older type with a fixed output of 5.4 V. Lack of programmability prevents preoperative threshold testing, and the 5.4-V output is higher than possible for some current generators. The pacing threshold should be determined with a pacemaker analyzer and the replacement should be programmed to appropriate output. Before disconnecting the old generator, be sure that the pacemaker analyzer, cables, and connections are intact and personnel in the operating room are aware of the cables. Some place the analyzer in a sterile bag on the operative field. With many generators, an Allen wrench placed in the header establishes electrical continuity with the ventricular lead; the pacing threshold can then be established before disconnecting the old generator. The old generator should be kept within reach as a backup in case of trouble with the new generator, the analyzer, or the connectors. Replacement generators must be programmed unipolar or bipolar to match the indwelling lead(s).

#### **LEAD SIZES**

VS-1 or IS-1 are common lead types, both 3.5 mm in diameter. The contacts do not always line up correctly across VS-1 and IS-1 generator ports, even though the connector diameter is the same. It is important to determine in advance whether adapters are needed to bridge incompatibilities. Older 5 and 6 mm leads, increasingly rare, require special adapters or generators.

# Postoperative Care

#### **WOUND CARE**

Patients are instructed to keep implant wounds dry until an office visit 7 to 10 days postoperatively. Any wound drainage at the postoperative visit is cultured, and prophylactic antibiotics are started until culture results are available. We have abandoned aspiration of the rare postoperative hematoma in favor of close observation, unless infection is an issue or spontaneous drainage occurs or appears imminent.

#### ANTIBIOTIC PROPHYLAXIS

Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics before dental work and other invasive procedures in pacemaker or ICD recipients is not recommended under AHA/ACC guidelines. We recommend prophylaxis for 3 months after device insertion, allowing time for the pacing leads to become endothelialized.

# Testing and Follow-up

#### OFFICE/CLINIC VERSUS TELEPHONE

Pacemakers require periodic testing to confirm sensing and pacing function and battery reserve. Currently these functions are tested at 1- to 3-month intervals. Follow-up can be done by transtelephonic monitoring, wireless telemetry and clinic or office visits.<sup>4</sup> Transtelephonic monitoring alleviates

transportation issues for elderly patients, but may be confusing for new subscribers. In addition to reducing travel and office visits, transtelephonic monitoring can provide 24-hour emergency service, an advantage with apprehensive or incapacitated patients. Techniques for remote management of pacemakers and ICDs are available with some current devices.

#### PACEMAKER PROGRAMMING

Trained, experienced personnel can do programming in the office. Manufacturer's representatives can provide valuable help and programmer upgrades. Remote pacemaker/ICD monitoring and programming are under development.

DDD pacemaker programming allows adjustment of electrogram sensitivity as well as pacing stimulus amplitude/pulse width for both the atrium and ventricle. Lower rate, upper rate, AV delay (AVD), and refractory periods for atrial and ventricular sensing are programmable. Rate responsiveness, unipolar/bipolar configuration, and many other options are also adjustable noninvasively.

We program newly inserted pacemaker stimulation amplitude 50% higher than nominal. At a 7- to 10-day

initial office visit, pacing thresholds are retested and amplitude and pulse width are adjusted to nominal levels if pacing thresholds are low. High initial output is less important with steroid-eluting leads. Details of pacemaker programming have been described elsewhere. Many current pacemakers provide automated threshold adjustment, but this may function inappropriately with unipolar leads.

Most problems detected by monitoring or device interrogation can be corrected by programming. The etiology of symptoms may be elicited from real-time electrograms or stored data. Adjustments can include not only sensitivity or pacing output but also pacing mode and rate for new-onset atrial fibrillation (Fig. 55-14A) or sinus node incompetence related to medication changes (Fig. 55-14B). Reoperation is required for lead displacement or fracture (Fig. 55-15), insulation degradation (Fig. 55-3), very low sensing amplitudes, and exit block (Fig. 55-16).<sup>30</sup>

Pacemaker interrogation should begin with a printout of the initial settings, an invaluable reference after involved programming. Telemetry defines time-related variation in heart rate, percentage of beats sensed and paced, the quality of the electrograms, lead impedance, and battery voltage.

**FIGURE 55-16** Right atrial (RA) and right ventricular (RV) unipolar electrograms in right ventricular exit block (*above*). Atrial (AP) and ventricular (VP) pacing are required for sinus arrest and marked first-degree atrioventricular block. Right ventricular capture is restored after RV pacing amplitude is programmed from 3.5 (*above*) to 5.4 V (*below*). Ventricular capture increases the effective heart rate, because the late, conducted ventricular electrograms (VS) in the upper tracing are sensed by the pacemaker and used to begin a new cardiac timing cycle. The circles indicate far-field sensing of the RA pacing artifact in the RV lead.

Pacing amplitude and pulse width are finely tuned for patient complaints, malfunctions on telemetry, or at 1-year follow-up visits. At least 100% safety margin is programmed on the pulse width threshold or amplitude. Parameters are adjusted to optimize patient comfort and battery life. Some pacemakers allow programmed reduction of a lower rate at night, eliminating unnecessary pacing during sleep. Very long AVD can eliminate ventricular pacing in some patients with first-degree block, but a reduction in the upper rate limit to 105 bpm may be necessary to extend AVD to 300 ms. Current pacemakers have a variety of algorithms to prevent excessive pacing in first-degree heart block, including automatic switching between AAI and DDD modes.

# Complications of Pacemaker Insertion

#### **MORTALITY**

Death is a rare complication of pacemaker implantation.<sup>30,33</sup> Lethal problems can include lead displacement, venous or cardiac perforation, air embolism, and VT or fibrillation.<sup>30</sup> A review of 650 pacemaker insertions by the author between January 1984 and April 1993 revealed one perioperative death resulting from heart failure induced by general anesthesia in a child with congenital heart disease (Table 55-3).

#### INCIDENCE OF COMPLICATIONS

The incidence of early pacemaker complications in one recent series was 6.7 and 4.9% requiring reoperation.<sup>30</sup> For patients older than 65 years, comparable figures were 6.1 and 4.4%, respectively. Lead displacement, pneumothorax, and cardiac perforation were the most common complications. The incidence of late complications was 7.2%.<sup>30</sup> The incidence of reoperation in the author's review of 480 cases was 4.0% (see Table 55-3).

#### LEAD DISPLACEMENT

The incidence of endocardial lead displacement with early lead designs was more than 10%.<sup>32</sup> With tined and positive fixation leads this has fallen to about 2%.<sup>6,30,32,33</sup> The incidence of this complication was 1.5% for atrial and ventricular leads in our review (see Table 55-3). Relevant technical issues have been described. We find that positive fixation leads can be applied in unique anatomical locations with essentially no increase in lead displacement (Table 55-4).

#### MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION

Pacemaker insertion may become an adjunct to medical therapy of angina in patients with inoperable coronary artery disease. However, angina, myocardial infarction, or death can result when heart rate increases of 10 bpm or more accompany surgical implants.

ICD, implantable cardioverter defibrillator.

#### **HEMOPNEUMOTHORAX**

Hemopneumothorax and pericardial tamponade result from injury to the heart, lungs, arteries, or veins. Errors with the Seldinger technique can cause such injuries. In patients older than 65 years, pneumothorax has been related to subclavian puncture.<sup>33</sup> In our experience with more than 1000 pacemaker insertions by cephalic cutdown, hemopneumothorax did not occur. In contrast, a recent review of 1088 consecutive implants by subclavian puncture revealed a 1.8% incidence of pneumothorax.<sup>33</sup>

#### PACEMAKER SYNDROME

Loss of AV synchrony produces symptoms related to reflex effects or contraction of the atria against closed AV valves. The resulting constellation of symptoms is known as *pacemaker syndrome*.<sup>4,8</sup> The symptoms are quite variable, but severely affected patients may refuse pacemaker magnet testing. Symptoms are relieved immediately by conversion from VVI to dual-chamber pacing.

#### LEAD ENTRAPMENT

Fixed-screw pacemaker leads can become firmly entangled in chordae tendineae beneath the tricuspid valve. Possible responses include further escalation of force, lead extraction, 6,35-37 or an open procedure. Our experience with this involved three firmly entangled leads in our first 1000 implants of fixed-screw positive fixation leads. The leads were capped and abandoned rather than escalate risk. We now avoid the anatomic center of the right ventricle when implanting these leads. This problem has not recurred subsequent to this experience and presumably is avoidable with Bisping leads.

#### INFECTION AND EROSION

Pacemaker infection manifests as frank sepsis, fever with vegetations/inflammation, and/or purulence or drainage at the pacemaker pocket. Indolent generator erosion or cellulitis are alternate presentations. Antibiotic suppression may temporarily abolish signs of infection, but the problem usually recurs weeks or months later. 6,38,39 Negative cultures and erosion may suggest moving the device to a fresh, adjacent site, but this is usually futile. Clinical resolution of recurrent device infection almost always requires removal of all hardware and insertion of a new device in a fresh site, optimally after a device-free interval. 2,38,39 The incidence of erosion, infection, hematoma, and lead displacement early after pacemaker implantation is reduced by operator experience. 6

#### PACEMAKER DYSFUNCTION

Mechanical defects in leads, lead displacement, or connection errors can cause pacemaker dysfunction. Late onset of lead dysfunction usually represents scarring at the lead—myocardial interface, changes in myocardial properties owing to tissue necrosis or drug effects, or a poor choice of lead position.

Insulation erosion can cause oversensing or, in bipolar leads, pacing failure owing to short-circuiting between the two conductors.

#### **GENERATOR DYSFUNCTION**

Electrical component failures are rare. Three pacemaker or ICD generator failures have required urgent device replacement over 10 years at our center. New pacemaker and lead designs may contain flaws that do not become apparent for many years.<sup>2</sup>

#### UNDERSENSING

Undersensing is failure to detect atrial or ventricular electrograms corresponding to P waves or R waves. The result is atrial or ventricular pacing that should have been inhibited by the unsensed beat. In a dual-chamber pacemaker, P wave undersensing may also cause failure to pace the ventricle after the P wave. Undersensing is often correctable by increasing generator sensitivity, but this can lead to oversensing. The latitude for reprogramming can be estimated by examining telemetered electrograms<sup>2,4</sup> (Figs. 55-17 and 55-18).

#### **OVERSENSING**

Inappropriate pacemaker inhibition or triggering may result from detection of myopotentials (muscular activity). This is most common in unipolar systems and may be correctable by programming reduced pacemaker sensitivity. External insulation erosion within the pacemaker pocket is a cause of oversensing (Fig. 55-3).

#### CROSSTALK AND FAR-FIELD SENSING

A deflection on the ventricular lead immediately after the atrial pacing artifact could be either premature ventricular depolarization (Fig. 55-17) or far-field sensing of an atrial depolarization (Fig. 55-13). Many pacemakers deal with this ambiguity by pacing the ventricle at a short (100 ms) AVD, an algorithm known as *safety pacing*.

Complexities of DDD programming involve blanking and refractory periods used to compensate for crosstalk or prevent retrograde AV conduction from causing pacemaker-mediated tachycardia (see the following). Crosstalk is ameliorated by bipolar lead systems.

#### **EXIT BLOCK**

Exit block is rising pacing threshold due to edema or scarring at the lead tip. Pacing threshold tends to increase over 7 to 14 days after lead insertion and stabilizes at about 6 weeks. This phenomenon is related to inflammation at the lead tip and is ameliorated by steroid-eluting leads.<sup>2</sup> Exit block may be overcome by programming increased amplitude or pulse width, but this shortens battery life. In unipolar systems, pacing of the chest wall and/or diaphragm may result from high generator output.

![](_page_17_Figure_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 55-17** Undersensing of ventricular premature depolarizations (VPD) illustrated in the upper panel of electrograms obtained by telemetry from a VVI pacemaker. The amplitude of the electrograms increases, and sensing is corrected after reprogramming to increase sensitivity to P waves from 2.5 mV (*above*) to 1.5 mV (*below*).

#### LEAD FRACTURE

Fracture of lead insulation or conductors may be demonstrable by chest x-ray (Fig. 55-15). Lead impedance less than 300 ohms suggest an insulation break, whereas impedance more than 1000 ohms suggests conductor problems, a loose setscrew, or improper connection. High impedance also can indicate incomplete extension of the fixation coil in a Bisping lead. Telemetry may detect impending lead fracture as electrical noise during hyperventilation, coughing, bending, or arm swinging. Oversensing of this type usually mandates lead replacement or repair.

At reoperation, dysfunctional leads can be capped or removed by lead extraction techniques (Figs. 55-19 and 55-20). Lead fracture has been promoted historically by design errors, bipolar construction, certain forms of polyurethane insulation, and epicardial insertion. Technical factors in fracture include ties applied to the lead without an anchoring sleeve, kinking, lead angulation, vigorous exercise programs, and subclavian crush. 6.24

#### SUBCLAVIAN CRUSH

Subclavian crush is probably caused by lead entrapment between the clavicle and first rib, in the costoclavicular ligament.

**FIGURE 55-18** Right atrial (RA) and right ventricular (RV) electrograms from DDD pacemaker during correction of atrial undersensing. Amplitude of the RA electrogram increases after atrial sensitivity is increased from 2.0 mV (*left*) to 0.8 mV (*center*) to 0.5 mV (*right*). The P-wave electrogram (*circled*) is not sensed at 2.0 mV, resulting in unnecessary atrial pacing (AP). Proper sensing is restored and the size of the electrogram increases (AS) as sensitivity is increased. VP indicates ventricular pacing. Rectangles in RA tracing identify far-field sensing of the ventricular pacing artifact.

**FIGURE 55-20** Telectronics Accufix atrial J-leads removed for retention wire fracture. Region of fracture appears benign in upper image. Lower image illustrates retention wire extrusion after percutaneous extraction. Extruded wire resembles a safety pin.

Stress during body movement is then thought to cause early lead failure. This pertains primarily to leads implanted by percutaneous puncture of the subclavian vein and seems to be minimized by cephalic cutdown. Techniques to minimize this problem have been described (Fig. 55-6).<sup>6,24</sup>

#### PACEMAKER-MEDIATED TACHYCARDIA

DDD pacemakers can propagate a reentrant arrhythmia, pacemaker-mediated tachycardia. This involves retrograde conduction through the AV node, initially triggered by a premature ventricular depolarization. If the pacemaker senses the retrograde atrial depolarization and paces the ventricle, a cycle is set up that can continue indefinitely at the upper rate limit of the pacemaker. Avoiding high upper rate limits and adjusting the postventricular atrial refractory period so that the pacemaker ignores atrial depolarizations for 300 to 350 ms after the QRS complex can mitigate this problem. Current pacemakers also attempt to break reentrant arrhythmias by periodic interruption of continuous high-rate pacing. Pacemaker telemetry provides notification of high-rate pacing suspicious of pacemaker-mediated tachycardia.<sup>4</sup>

## **Innovations and Special Problems**

#### LEAD REPAIR

Repair can extend the useful life of implanted leads for years. Most repairs are done within the device pocket or in surrounding areas. Fracture or erosion of conductors or insulation can result from normal wear or active life styles. Lead dysfunction can result from vigorous exercise including situps (abdominal insulation erosion), handball (insulation/conductor erosion), and wood chopping (conductor damage).<sup>2</sup>

Repair kits contain silicone glue and silicone tubing or unipolar tip replacements. Possible repairs differ for unipolar and bipolar leads. Unipolar leads consist of a single conductor surrounded by insulation. Insulation breaks can be overlaid with glue and tubing. Conductor fracture can be repaired by splicing a new lead tip onto the functional segment. 41 Bipolar leads contain two conductors with two levels of insulation, one to prevent short-circuiting between the conductors and the other to prevent external current leaks and conductorgenerator contact. Representative designs are shown in Figs. 55-19, 55-20, and 55-26d. External insulation repair in such leads is similar to unipolar lead repair. However, internal insulation faults require converting the lead to unipolar function and splicing on a new lead tip. Conductor fracture also can be repaired this way. The repair involves exposing and baring about 10 mm of the conductor to be preserved. The conductor to be excluded is cut back 5 to 10 mm to avoid short-circuiting. A new tip is attached to the bared conductor, using an internal setscrew, silicone glue, and ties. These repairs have been robust in our experience but are not recommended in pacemaker-dependent patients.

Unipolar and bipolar epicardial leads can also be repaired, if the break is accessible. Unipolar lead repair is similar to repair of unipolar endocardial leads. Bipolar epicardial leads generally consist of two unipolar leads connected by a Y to coaxial segments for connection. The simplest repair involves locating the unipolar segment of the good lead and splicing on a new tip. Particularly challenging is a fracture near one of the cardiac electrodes, at a point of metal fatigue. If the broken conductor is not the tip electrode, reprogramming the generator to a unipolar configuration restores function. If the cathode segment is fractured, most generators cannot be programmed to use the anode, and pacing is lost. However, function can be restored by exposing the lead, splicing a new tip on the anode, connecting that lead to generator, and capping the cathode.<sup>41</sup>

When exposing leads within the pocket for repairs, the electrocautery should be set as low as practical, to avoid melting external lead insulation. If cautery contacts a bare conductor, myocardial injury can render the lead useless because of exit block. Also, conduction of cautery to the myocardium can induce VF. Sharp dissection is preferred when close to friction points or angulation that promote conductor exposure.

#### PACEMAKER LEAD EXTRACTION

Indications for lead extraction include chronic infection or life-threatening mechanical defects. <sup>6,35-37</sup> Some recommend

that any dysfunctional pacemaker lead should be removed, but there is little objective data to support this. Until recently, extraction of transvenous leads required external traction or thoracotomy/cardiotomy with inflow occlusion or cardiopulmonary bypass. Chronically implanted leads can be densely fibrosed to the right ventricular myocardium, vena cava, innominate vein, or subclavian vein.

Lead extraction was developed by Byrd.<sup>35</sup> A locking stylet is passed inside the central channel to the tip of the lead where it uncoils, allowing traction to be applied to the lead tip. Telescoping Teflon, plastic, or metal sheaths fitting the lead are passed along the lead to mobilize it. When the long sheath reaches the lead tip, counter traction is applied to the myocardium with the sheath while traction is applied to the lead tip with the locking stylet (see Fig. 55-19). Success with this technique has been greater than 90%, with a 3% chance of serious morbidity or death. Laser or radiofrequency energy can also be transmitted through specially constructed sheaths to ablate adhesions.<sup>6,39</sup> Technical details have been described.<sup>6</sup> Extraction of leads more than 10 years old is difficult and tedious. Complete removal of lead tips is inversely related to the age of the lead (Fig. 55-21A).<sup>37</sup>

#### **ACCUFIX LEAD**

An unusual fracture affects the Telectronics Accufix lead, a bipolar, Bisping-type atrial screw-in lead. A J shape near the tip directs the lead to the atrial appendage. A curved retention wire welded to the indifferent ring electrode near the tip and bonded to the lead body with polyurethane maintains the J-shape. Fracture and extrusion of this retention wire (Figs. 55-19 and 55-20) was associated with deaths from cardiac tamponade, related to punctures of the atrium or aorta by fractured wire. More than 45,000 of these leads were implanted, and many have been surgically extracted. Because some morbidity and mortality occurred during extraction of this lead, the manufacturer recommended conservative management. Recently, conservative management has also been recommended for a fracture tendency in the Sprint Fidelis ICD lead.<sup>6</sup>

#### ATRIAL FIBRILLATION AND MODE SWITCHING

Sinoatrial node dysfunction can involve both sinus bradycardia and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Early DDD pacemakers responded to atrial fibrillation by pacing at the upper rate limit. Initially DDD pacing was avoided in atrial fibrillation for this reason. The current view that atrial pacing decreases the frequency of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and mode switching allows DDD pacing to be used despite a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Mode switching is triggered when a programmed upper rate limit is exceeded. The pacemaker then switches to VVIR mode until the atrial rate returns to the physiologic range. Successful mode switching requires bipolar leads and high sensitivity in patients with low-amplitude atrial fibrillation. Management of atrial fibrillation in elderly people may involve fewer medications and interventions than in younger patients.<sup>8</sup>

#### DATABASE SUPPORT

Pacemaker and ICD data are needed for billing, operative notes, device tracking, programming, and follow-up. Data should be available in real time in the event of an emergency room visit involving device malfunction. Commercial and homegrown software packages are available for this. Security, audit trails, 24/7 availability, and multiuser wireless capability are important characteristics for such systems.

#### GENERAL SURGERY AND PACEMAKERS

General surgery in a pacemaker-dependent patient raises important questions, 42 especially when surgery requires unipolar cautery. The following must be documented: (1) model and manufacturer of the pacemaker, from pacemaker ID card, monitoring service, medical record, or x-ray appearance; 43,44 (2) magnet mode behavior and any peculiarities related to impedance sensing monitors; (3) successful testing of programmer on the pacemaker; (4) programmed parameters, polarity, battery life, and lead characteristics; (5) degree of pacemaker dependence; (6) a backup plan transthoracic pacing or chronotropic agents if the pacemaker fails; (7) reprogramming to VOO, DOO, or VVT mode intraoperatively with rate response off to prevent inhibition or pacemaker acceleration<sup>44</sup> by electromagnetic interference (EMI); (8) a physician to deal with any intra-operative pacemaker problem; and (9) restored pacemaker program, thresholds, and function postoperatively. Regarding pacemaker dependence, if the preoperative ECG reveals 100% pacing, the pacemaker should be reprogrammed while monitoring to determine the presence and rate of an escape rhythm. Pacemaker dependence may increase during anesthesia, with withdrawal of sympathetic stimulation. The Heart Rhythm Society has defined guidelines for perioperative management of these patients.

#### **ELECTROCAUTERY**

Manufacturers recommend against using electrocautery in pacemaker patients because of possible EMI or pacemaker damage. If electrocautery must be used, unipolar cautery is likely to cause EMI, whereas bipolar cautery is not. Unipolar pacemakers are more susceptible to EMI than bipolar units. EMI effects include (1) pacemaker oversensing, confusing EMI with a rapid heart rate. Pacemaker inhibition results but reverses when the EMI stops. (2) Pacemaker reprogramming. (3) Acceleration of impedance-sensing pacemakers to the upper rate limit. (4) Reversion to a "backup mode" or "magnet mode." (5) Permanent loss of pacing, fortunately rare.<sup>43</sup>

Programming sensing off and increasing the pacing rate above the intrinsic heart rate anticipated during surgery can minimize EMI pacemaker inhibition. However, if competition with spontaneous beats does occur, there is a risk of inducing of atrial fibrillation or VT. In view of this, the pacemaker should be returned to an appropriate sensing mode as soon as possible after the completion of surgery.

#### **MAGNET MODE**

A permanent magnet placed over a pacemaker closes a magnetic reed switch and initiates "magnet mode." In some

pacemakers, magnet mode is VOO, eliminating all sensing. Other pacemakers convert to VOO for a few beats, then revert to the programmed function. A magnet may also induce a threshold margin test; this assesses the adequacy of the pacing margin by decreasing the pulse width in a predictable pattern.

#### STEROID-ELUTING LEADS

Fibrosis at the lead tip can be limited by incorporating a dexamethasone pellet that dissolves over months. This improves early pacing thresholds versus conventional leads<sup>2</sup> and has been particularly advantageous in epicardial leads.

#### ADULTS WITH CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE

Congenital heart disease may include a persistent left superior vena cava draining to the CS. This favors a right subclavian approach, although the left side can be used.<sup>27</sup> Preoperative echo-Doppler or angiography can define caval and CS anatomy. A left superior vena cava may dislocate the subclavian vein, increasing the risk of subclavian vein puncture and favoring cephalic cut down. Situs inversus and corrected transposition are disorienting, if undetected prior to pacemaker insertion.

Positive fixation leads are particularly useful for atrial pacing after a Mustard operation or a caval-pulmonary anastomosis and for pacing the smooth-walled "right" ventricle in corrected transposition of the great arteries.<sup>27</sup> A CS lead can provide ventricular pacing in some patients after Fontan surgery (Fig. 55-21). Pacing via the CS or middle cardiac vein may be useful in patients with a mechanical tricuspid valve (Fig. 55-21B).

#### PACING IN INFANTS AND CHILDREN

Transvenous leads in children should include an intracardiac loop to allow for growth (Figs. 55-4 and 55-15). Unipolar,

**FIGURE 55-21A** Duration of lead implantation (Dwell Time) versus incidence of incomplete lead extraction. Incidence decreases from 23% for 12- to 25-year leads to 6% for 0- to 3-year leads. Lead fragments left behind were solid metal tips entrapped connective tissue sheath around lead. This results in tip separation, usually at the level of the innominate vein. There were no clinical complications related to retention of these lead tips.<sup>37</sup>

![](_page_21_Figure_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 55-21B** This 31-year-old male with sinoatrial node dysfunction and third degree heart block had previously undergone closure of atrial and ventricular septal defects, a Maze procedure, and pulmonary and tricuspid valve replacement twice, most recently with a mechanical tricuspid valve. Ventricular pacing was achieved with endocardial lead in posterior cardiac vein, avoiding thoracotomy. (Reproduced with permission from Spotnitz HM, Wang DY: Middle and posterior cardiac veins: an underused option for ventricular pacing, *J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg.* 2012 May;143(5):1223-1225.)

positive fixation leads are ideal for this purpose,<sup>27</sup> but other approaches have been described.<sup>22</sup> We prefer cephalic cutdown, with optical magnification, if needed. A flexible guidewire is passed centrally and a 7-French introducer introduces the lead. A longitudinal split of the cephalic vein facilitates advancing the introducer (Fig. 55-8). In very small infants, the external jugular vein at the thoracic inlet may be useful. A catheter introduced via the femoral vein can guide subclavian vein puncture. Thoracotomy is a third option.<sup>22</sup> Infants less than 6 months of age are suboptimal candidates for transvenous pacing because of limited long-term lead utility. Subpectoral generator placement in children less than 6 years old reduces infection risk.

#### **DEMENTIA**

Dementia complicates surgery under local anesthesia. Sedation can make dementia worse and exaggerate bradycardia. A demented patient's arms should be secured to prevent groping for the surgical wound. Postoperative confusion and thrashing can cause pacemaker lead displacement. An intracardiac loop decreases this hazard. A family member at the bedside may minimize patient alarm. Every effort should be made to anticipate and avoid such issues.

#### ARRHYTHMIA ABLATION

Arrhythmia ablation is the commonest therapeutic intervention in EP laboratories, with hundreds of thousands performed annually. Ablation procedures can result in AV block or sinus bradycardia requiring permanent pacing. Ablation in the vicinity of the AV node is particularly hazardous. Most commonly, temporary pacing supports heart rate until a permanent pacemaker can be inserted. If ventricular escape rhythm is poor, overnight observation on telemetry and high

initial pacemaker output are desirable. Alternatively, a pacemaker can be inserted and allowed to heal before ablation, if high-grade block is anticipated.

#### TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS

The usual indication for pacemaker insertion in cardiac transplant recipients is sinus bradycardia or sinus arrest, managed with AAIR pacing.<sup>45</sup> Patients frequently outgrow the need for pacing within 2 years.<sup>45</sup> The surface ECG may be confusing, showing P waves from the atria of both the donor and the recipient and AV dissociation of the recipient atrium and donor ventricle. If a 1:1 ventricular response is observed with atrial pacing at 150 bpm, a ventricular lead is not essential. The atrial appendage is located toward the midline in these patients (Fig. 55-22).

# IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER DEFIBRILLATOR RECIPIENTS

In the early evolution of ICDs, crosstalk with pacemakers could lead to inappropriate ICD shocks or ICD undersensing of VF. Independent implantation of pacemakers and ICDs is described,<sup>46</sup> but with availability of integrated ICD-DDD pacemakers, such techniques are now rarely indicated.

#### LONG QT SYNDROME

Long QT is a genetically determined repolarization abnormality that is associated with sudden death. Recommended therapies include stellate ganglionectomy and/or adrenergic blockade.<sup>47</sup> In severe cases, the pacing threshold may be too high for ventricular pacing, and atrial pacing may be preferable. ICD therapy is now common, and techniques for implantation in infants have been described.

![](_page_22_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 55-22** DDDR pacing system in a cardiac allograft recipient illustrates a shift of the atrial appendage toward the midline, characteristic of these patients.

# IDIOPATHIC HYPERTROPHIC SUBAORTIC STENOSIS

Idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (obstructive cardiomyopathy), with severe left ventricular outflow obstruction, causes angina and/or syncope. Right ventricular pacing with a short AVD preexcites the ventricle and decreases outflow gradients in some patients<sup>16,17</sup> (Fig. 55-23). ICD therapy is increasingly common in this population.

#### PERMANENT BIVENTRICULAR PACING

End-stage cardiomyopathy and heart failure progress with time, leading ultimately to cardiac transplantation, cardiac assist devices, or death. CRT is a lower cost option for class III or IV and possibly class II failure. Clinical trials demonstrate modest subjective and objective benefits of CRT in dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction less than 36% and QRS intervals greater than 120 ms. 5,18,29,34 Mortality benefits are suggested by recent trials.<sup>5,34</sup> Marked clinical improvement is seen in some patients (Fig. 55-11), but up to 40% of patients are nonresponders. Endocardial LV lead insertion fails in 5 to 10% of candidates, usually because of difficulty cannulating the CS. These failures often result in referrals to thoracic surgeons for epicardial lead insertion. More than 100,000 patients undergo CRT annually in the United States, which could lead to 5000 referrals yearly for epicardial lead insertion. Minimal access<sup>48</sup> and robotic<sup>49</sup> LV lead insertion have been developed. Referrals might increase if better techniques for epicardial LV lead insertion were available.

#### TEMPORARY BIVENTRICULAR PACING

Clinical success with CRT and the potential to increase cardiac output while reducing myocardial oxygen consumption

make temporary biventricular pacing attractive for management of low-output states after cardiac surgery. Preliminary results 50,51 indicate that this approach is promising. Temporary biventricular pacing can be recommended and is readily achievable for patients in low-output states with second- or third-degree block after cardiac surgery. 18

#### ATRIAL AND VENTRICULAR TACHYARRHYTHMIAS

Overdrive pacing can be effective for ventricular tachyarrhythmias, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, or atrial flutter. Implantable defibrillators are under development for atrial fibrillation. Antitachycardia ventricular pacing for ventricular tachyarrhythmia has been integrated into ICD therapy. Ablation procedures are available for many supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias.

#### **Environmental Issues**

#### **ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE**

EMI<sup>43</sup> can be caused by electrocautery, cellular telephones, magnetic resonance imagers, microwaves, diathermy, arc welders, powerful radar or radio transmitters, and theft detectors in retail stores. Any defective, sparking electrical appliance or motor, electric razor, lawn mower, or electric light can be problematic. EMI is most concerning in pacemaker dependent patients and ICD recipients. Pacemaker recipients who are not pacemaker dependent will not be distressed by brief periods of pacemaker inhibition, but pacemaker-dependent patients can lose consciousness in 5 to 15 seconds. Bipolar pacing systems provide added protection against EMI. Cellular telephones should be separated by several inches from pacemaker generators, preferably on the contralateral side. ICD circuits are insulated against inappropriate firing precipitated by EMI. During surgery using unipolar cautery, the defibrillation circuit of an ICD should be temporarily disabled. MRI compatible pacemakers and defibrillators are now available but require specific facility protocols.

#### MECHANICAL INTERFERENCE

Lithotripsy, trauma, dental equipment, and even bumpy roads can affect pacemakers. Automobile accidents have caused pacemaker damage and disruption of pacemaker wounds. Vibration causes inappropriately high heart rates in rate-responsive units. Patients with poor escape rhythms should be discouraged from exposure to deceleration injury in contact sports, basketball, handball, downhill skiing, surfing, diving, mountain climbing, and gymnastics. Participants in these activities should realize that abrupt pacemaker failure could occur in the event of lead displacement related to trauma.

#### **RADIOACTIVITY**

The integrated circuits of current pacemakers can be damaged by radiotherapy.<sup>2</sup> If the pacemaker cannot be adequately shielded from the radiation field, it may be necessary to remove and replace it or move the pacing system to a remote site.

#### QUALITY OF LIFE

Quality of life is not a major concern for most pacemaker recipients. This preferred system involves transtelephonic monitoring, a preoperative visit, a 10-day post-operative visit, a 1-year visit to adjust output, and yearly visits unless functional problems or impending battery depletion are detected. Some recipients are never happy with their pacemakers because of body image problems, vague symptoms, or concern that life will be artificially prolonged. The value of continued pacing or generator

replacement in patients with advanced debilitation is a subject of debate.<sup>4</sup>

# IMPLANTABLE CARDIAC DEFIBRILLATORS

# **Background**

More than 400,000 deaths in the United States each year are classified as sudden and likely to be caused by arrhythmias.<sup>7</sup> Michel Mirowski conceptualized the implantable defibrillator

in the late 1960s. Overcoming theoretical, engineering, and financial obstacles, he participated in a successful clinical trial of his device in the early 1980s. <sup>52</sup> Current ICDs reflect a dramatic and expensive growth in technology. The efficacy of the ICD in prevention of sudden death is well established. Clinical trials, experience, and the passage of time emphasize survival advantages of the ICD over other modalities, including antiarrhythmic drugs and subendocardial resection. <sup>7</sup> The ICD is associated with the lowest sudden death mortality (1–2% per year) of any known form of therapy. <sup>53,54</sup> The cost of an ICD plus leads exceeds \$30,000 and has increased with incorporation of CRT. Prophylactic ICD insertion for primary prevention is increasing, despite discomfort and lifestyle issues.

Clinical trials including AVID, MUSST, MADIT I and II, SCD-HeFT, and COMPANION demonstrated benefits of ICD therapy.<sup>7,42,55-58</sup> The CABG Patch Trial,<sup>57</sup> which compared coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) to CABG+ICD, and DINAMIT, which studied ICD implantation early after myocardial infarction, failed to demonstrate advantages of ICD insertion. Trials now focus on prophylactic ICD therapy, CRT-Ds and cost-effectiveness. Accumulating evidence supports prophylactic use of CRT-Ds in patients with coronary disease or dilated cardiomyopathy.<sup>7,58</sup> The appropriate role for prophylactic CRT-Ds is still evolving. The Heart Rhythm Society will not certify surgeons to implant ICDs unless they have passed its certification exam. Patients with prophylactic device insertion are being followed in a national registry. Information about this can

be found at http://www.accncdr.com/webncdr/ICD. ICD insertion for primary prevention has doubled or tripled the number of candidates for these devices.

ICD battery life is greater than 5 years. Today's devices are highly programmable. Size and weight are similar to pacemakers of the 1970s. Lead systems have evolved from epicardial patches requiring thoracotomy to endocardial systems.<sup>7,54,59,60</sup> Defibrillation thresholds (DFTs) are reduced by biphasic shocks and "hot can" technology.7 Pectoral implantation is the current standard, some deep to the pectoralis major. Abdominal implantation is now reserved for special cases (Figs. 55-24 and 55-25). Electrograms can be downloaded to expedite decisions about antiarrhythmics, prevent inappropriate shocks, and detect oversensing. Remote monitoring of ICD function is available from some manufacturers. VVI, DDD, biventricular, and anti-tachycardia pacing have been integrated into ICDs. Accelerated development has pressured the Food and Drug Administration to rapidly approve new technology. When the US Health Care Finance Administration refused in 1995 to allow Medicare reimbursement to support device development, ICD development shifted overseas.

## Physiology

VT associated with ischemic cardiomyopathy is commonly a reentrant arrhythmia that may be prevented by drugs, catheter ablation, or surgical maneuvers that alter the timing and electrical attributes of the reentrant circuit. Myocardial

infarction creates the areas of scarring and slow conduction needed for reentry. Other forms of VT and VF involve aberrancies of automaticity related to acute myocardial ischemia, increased ventricular wall stress, and myopathic cellular injury. Some class I antiarrhythmics have been shown to increase postinfarction mortality, possibly owing to proarrhythmic effects.

#### **Indications**

Candidates for ICD insertion for secondary prevention therapy have suffered documented VT or VF in the absence of acute myocardial infarction and have been proved unsuitable for antiarrhythmic drug or surgical therapy, based on programmed electrical stimulation studies in the EP laboratory. However, many patients who suffer cardiac arrest do not have inducible VT at EP study, and many patients with a history of syncope and presyncope have inducible VT but no history of a clinical arrhythmia. Many antiarrhythmics have negative inotropic and proarrhythmic effects. Serial EP studies of drug efficacy have been discredited in clinical trials.<sup>7</sup>

In mid-1996 the Food and Drug Administration approved an indication for prophylactic ICD insertion based on early termination of the MADIT trial.<sup>55</sup> If EP studies demonstrate inducible VT in patients with nonsustained VT and a remote history of myocardial infarction, an ICD is indicated. MADIT II results support ICD insertion in all patients with a history of myocardial infarction and

left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%. Primary prevention indications include ischemic cardiomyopathy with LVEF  $\leq$  35% and NYHA Class II or III  $\geq$  40 days post MI. LVEF  $\leq$  30% and NYHA Class I  $\geq$  40 days after MI also qualifies, as does nonischemic myopathy with LVEF  $\leq$  35% and NYHA Class II or III.

# **Device Description**

ICDs usually employ one bipolar lead for ventricular pacing/rate sensing and another to deliver the defibrillation current (Fig. 55-26). These are integrated into a single lead body for endocardial insertion.<sup>7</sup> A unipolar ventricular lead paired with an "active can" delivers the defibrillation current in some designs. Rate and waveform identify malignant rhythms for treatment. Up to 30% of ICD shocks are inappropriate, for sinus tachycardia or other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. A bipolar atrial lead can help differentiate supraventricular arrhythmias from VT. Subcutaneous leads can be added for patients with high DFTs. Most implants are just caudad to the clavicle, but long lead lengths allow abdominal locations. Positive fixation leads are preferred.

The ICD contains a high-energy battery and a capacitor that steps up the output voltage to 600 to 800 V at 35 to 40 J. Shocks with positive and negative phases reduce DFTs. ICDs incorporate integrated circuits and a telemetry antenna. A broad range of programmable diagnostic and therapeutic functions are supported.

# **Surgical Procedure**

#### PATIENT PREPARATION

Most ICD recipients are at increased mortality/morbidity risk for any surgery. Preoperative optimization of therapy for ischemia, heart failure, and systemic illnesses is critical. The mortality of ICD implantation in our program has been low since 1983, with ischemia more lethal than severe cardiomy-opathy. Ischemia on stress testing mandates CABG, coronary angioplasty, intra-aortic balloon pump, or deferral of DFT testing.

#### SURGICAL APPROACH

Epicardial patch leads<sup>59,60</sup> are now rarely used. They fell into disfavor when the CABG Patch Trial demonstrated that infectious complications were more common in ICD recipients than control patients.<sup>57</sup> Extrapericardial ICD patches cause less fibrosis, less impairment of diastolic properties,<sup>61,62</sup> and less potential for graft impingement than intrapericardial patches. Biphasic waveforms, improved leads, high-output "hot can" generators, and subcutaneous leads have made the endocardial approach successful.<sup>7</sup>

#### MANUFACTURER'S REPRESENTATIVES

The complexity of current devices and a large number of spare parts, leads, and catheters have legitimized the presence of manufacturer's representatives during ICD implants.

![](_page_26_Figure_2.jpeg)

This increases influence of the manufacturer on the implant and warrants oversight. CRS regulations mandate electrophysiologist oversight of DFT measurement.

#### **TECHNIQUE**

We prefer local anesthesia, conscious sedation, and unipolar cautery for endocardial ICD insertion. Invasive, radial artery pressure monitoring is used during DFT measurement. Positioning and draping are similar to that for pacemaker insertion. Adhesive defibrillation pads are added over the right breast and beneath the left scapula. Pads should not be placed directly over the site of a possible subcutaneous ICD patch or array in the lateral axilla; this can result in serious equipment damage from arcing if external defibrillation is necessary. Cefazolin or combined vancomycin/gentamicin is used for antibiotic prophylaxis.

We prefer a cephalic vein cutdown via a 6-cm incision over the deltopectoral groove. If the vein is small, a guidewire is used to insert a 9-French introducer. Enlargement of the cephalic venotomy may be helpful (Fig. 55-8). The guidewire can be left in place if a multiple-lead system is to be employed. Introducer kinking can lead to difficulty passing ICD leads. High central pressures will cause bleeding until the introducer is removed. Aligning the introducer with the course of the subclavian vein before removing the obturator minimizes this.

As the lead enters the ventricle, VT or VF may be triggered. This is less disruptive if an external defibrillator is connected and precharged, with a capable OR nurse or electrophysiologist at the controls. The ventricular lead should be advanced gently as far as possible to the apex. Positive fixation ICD

leads are best for both atrium and ventricle. Fluoroscopic and impedance checks for lead displacement are warranted during DFTs, particularly if external defibrillation is necessary. Intravenous norepinephrine is useful for blood pressure support. In patients under general anesthesia, transesophageal echocardiography is useful for monitoring LV function during DFTs. Swan-Ganz catheters are not useful for monitoring—their removal can dislodge the ICD leads.

If CRT is indicated, we insert the LV lead first, via cephalic cutdown. RV and RA leads are inserted via subclavian puncture. CS localization can be expedited by steerable EP catheters, dye injection to detect blood flow out of the CS, transesophageal echocardiography, and other techniques.<sup>5</sup> The left subclavian location is now the standard of care for generator location, in a subcutaneous or subpectoral pocket.

The left upper quadrant abdominal or posterior rectus sheath (Fig. 55-24) is now a rare pocket option and requires long leads, general anesthesia or sedation/local anesthesia to tunnel leads to the abdomen from the subclavian incision. The tunneler must pass anterior to the costal margin. The lead is looped at the shoulder and firmly secured against displacement by a tug on the abdominal end (Figs. 55-24 and 55-25). A limited thoracotomy may be required to add an epicardial lead for CRT if endocardial CS lead insertion fails (Fig. 55-27).

#### **DEFIBRILLATION THRESHOLD**

DFT testing was previously the standard of care but is increasingly controversial, particularly in primary prevention implants, and should be done in consultation with an electrophysiologist. Vulnerability testing is a described option. DFT testing is also less important as technological advances have

![](_page_27_Picture_12.jpeg)

**FIGURE 55-27** Epicardial LV leads inserted in 45-year-old man for treatment of congestive heart failure after two failed endocardial attempts. PM-ICD was required for complete heart block and cardiomyopathy after aortic and mitral valve replacement for bacterial endocarditis.

increased the probability of success. The DFT is the point of maximum risk in ICD insertion and is usually induced twice and reversed by the ICD to confirm a 10-J safety margin and adequate sensing of VF. Backup defibrillation is available through defibrillation pads. If the DFT is too high after optimizing RV lead location, a subcutaneous axillary patch or wire is used to distribute the defibrillation current over the posterolateral left ventricle. High-output generators and reversed shock polarity may also help. DFT testing can depress cardiac function and cause a low-output state. <sup>5,46</sup> The mortality of ICD insertion is about 1%. Complications include myocardial infarction, heart failure, infection, lead displacement, venous occlusion, tamponade, hemopneumothorax, and pocket hematoma.

#### REFRACTORY VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION

VF may become refractory to external defibrillation as a result of iatrogenic pneumothorax, myocardial ischemia, electromechanical dissociation, and inappropriate ICD lead location. Refractory VF rarely may require open cardiac massage or cardiopulmonary bypass until a solution can be found.

#### POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Same day discharge or telemetry and an overnight stay are both current practice after ICD insertion for secondary prevention, and DFT testing is controversial. Pacing and sensing properties confirm lead stability before discharge. In some cases, DFTs are also retested. An ICD magnet should be available for treatment of patients with freshly implanted ICDs. The magnet is used to inhibit inappropriate shocks caused by ventricular lead displacement or supraventricular arrhythmias. Patients undergoing ICD insertion for primary prevention may be discharged on the day of surgery. We administer ciprofloxacin for 5 days after discharge to complete prophylaxis based on a historical precedent. A postoperative office visit is scheduled 7 to 14 days after implant.

#### SURGICAL FOLLOW-UP

At the postoperative office visit, lead position, patient symptoms, EP follow-up appointments, and the surgical site are assessed. If drainage is present, the wound is cultured and treated. For sterile drainage, ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is administered for 10 days, and the patient is asked to keep the site dry until healing is complete. Refractory infection requires hospitalization and ICD removal.

#### **DEVICE FOLLOW-UP**

ICDs require outpatient EP evaluation at 1- to 3-month intervals to cycle the capacitors, confirm battery life, test pacing thresholds, and download electrograms. Data are reviewed for aborted charging cycles arrhythmias. Programming is adjusted accordingly. For any shocks reported, telemetry can confirm proper function, detect inappropriate shocks, and demonstrate electrical noise or oversensing that requires lead revision. Wireless ICD monitoring from home is now a clinical reality for some ICDs.

# Late Follow-up and Generator Replacement

#### **BATTERY DEPLETION**

ICD battery life is now typically more than 60 months. Complications of generator replacement include infection, myocardial infarction, and death. Progression of heart failure and/or coronary artery disease increases the risk of replacement. Replacement is done under local anesthesia, with sedation during DFTs. DFTs may be deferred if the risk is excessive. Patients are discharged on the same day with antibiotic coverage, unless leads are replaced.

#### LEAD DYSFUNCTION

The incidence of lead failure increases with time. About 50% of ICD recipients have some lead revision by 10 years of follow-up.<sup>63</sup> Problems include lead fracture,<sup>64</sup> high DFTs, oversensing, undersensing, and exit block. Oversensing can be caused by insulation damage. Oversensing can be corrected by adding a transvenous rate-sensing lead, preferably of the positive-fixation type. Visible insulation damage inside the defibrillator pocket may be repairable with silicone glue, tubing, and ties.

Patch leads can fail because of conductor fracture or distortion by fibrosis. With endocardial leads, DFTs may increase as a result of cardiac enlargement, which shifts the left ventricle laterally, away from the right ventricular lead. Insertion of a subcutaneous patch or array (Fig. 55-28) and/or a highoutput generator can correct high DFTs.

#### Additional Issues

#### **BRIDGE TO TRANSPLANT**

CRT-D therapy is increasingly common for amelioration of symptoms and protection against VT/VF in patients awaiting cardiac allografting. Cost is an important concern.

#### QUALITY OF LIFE

Issues include the discomfort and distress of shocks and inconvenience of outpatient visits. These are particularly trying for elderly patients. ICD generators, though shrinking in size and weight, are bulky compared with pacemakers. Many patients are elated to be rescued by their ICD from a malignant arrhythmia, but others find this distressing. 40,65,66 Many ICD patients do not comply with recommended limitations on driving automobiles. 67,68 Fortunately, the rate of driving accidents in ICD recipients is reportedly low.

#### **COST-EFFECTIVENESS**

ICD therapy is expensive, but VT/VF management in the absence of an ICD is also costly.<sup>69</sup> Low cost of ICD generators and leads would increase the economic appeal of ICD prophylaxis.

**FIGURE 55-28** This illustrates posterolateral accessory lead inserted in chest wall for failure of ICD to defibrillate. Patient is 62-year-old female with prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction. ICD function was initially satisfactory, but progressive CHF and LV dilatation created excessive ICD energy requirement.

#### **NEW TECHNOLOGY**

ICDs and pacemakers that do not require endocardial leads are available or in clinical trials. Functionality of these systems is limited but valuable for selected patients.
