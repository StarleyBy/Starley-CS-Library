## Percutaneous Catheter-based Mitral Valve Repair

Mani Arsalan • J. Michael DiMaio • Michael Mack

Mitral valve repair (MVR) remains the standard of care for patients with severe valve incompetence. MVR is usually accomplished by either an open surgical (sternotomy) approach or by minimally invasive (right lateral minithoracotomy) access techniques. Recently there has been an intense interest in developing percutaneous catheter-based techniques, especially for high-risk patients.<sup>1-4</sup>

Although the success of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been rapid, progress toward percutaneous correction of mitral regurgitation (MR) has been much more modest.<sup>5</sup> The success of catheter-based treatment of aortic stenosis can be attributed to a number of factors: the singular pathophysiology of the diseased valve, the aortic valve's anatomical location that allows for precise valve stent implantations at the annular level, and the successful development of delivery systems using conventional imaging techniques. The field of percutaneous MVR, however, has not progressed so rapidly for a host of reasons including the complex pathophysiology of MR with a diversity of etiologies, as well as challenges in imaging and delivery and secure anchoring of the valve without impingement on surrounding cardiac structures. These obstacles have led to slower than anticipated clinical adoption of catheter-based approaches for the treatment of MR. To understand the potential for successful therapy, it is first instructive to examine the pathophysiology of the various mechanisms of the disease.

## PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF MITRAL REGURGITATION

The mitral valve (MV) is a complex structure composed of two leaflets, a fibrous annulus with varying degrees of continuity and integrity, and a subvalvular apparatus consisting of chordae tendineae and papillary muscles attached to the wall of the left ventricle (LV). The etiology of MR can be categorized into two ways: primary also called degenerative or organic, and secondary or functional MR.

In primary MR (Carpentier Type II), the intrinsic disease is a result of leaflet degeneration, ranging from fibroelastic deficiency to an excess of connective tissue called Barlow's disease, in patients with MV prolapse. Although MR of intrinsic

disease occurs initially as isolated leaflet disease, secondary annular dilatation occurs in the majority of patients by the time that they present for treatment.

The largest proportion of patients who present with MR, however, are those with secondary MR (Carpentier Type IIIB), in which the valve is anatomically normal but has been stretched by tethering and ventricular dilatation.<sup>6</sup> Secondary MR is not a primary valvular pathology but is a result of a cascade of events initiated by this ventricular dilation. Ventricular dilation leads to apical and lateral distraction of the papillary muscles, which results in tethering of the mitral leaflets. This tethering causes central regurgitation secondary to failure of coaptation of the anatomically normal leaflets during systole. The causes and prognosis of secondary MR are inherently different from intrinsic disease. Although annular dilatation also occurs in this disease, it is a secondary phenomenon. The principle utilized during surgical repair of secondary MR is based upon overcorrection of the annular dilatation component by performing an undersized annuloplasty to restore leaflet coaptation. To date, it is still unknown whether correcting secondary MR has any impact on the underlying pathology or affects longterm survival.8-11

# CURRENT TRANSCATHETER APPROACHES TO THE TREATMENT OF MITRAL REGURGITATION

There is a wide spectrum of devices and approaches to manage MR from a percutaneous or transcatheter approach (Table 41-1).<sup>12</sup> Most catheter-based repair techniques are based on techniques that have been proven to be effective in open surgical MVR. Examples include the edge-to-edge technique, placement of artificial chords, and annular remodeling. However, the challenges in adapting these techniques to catheter-based treatment are significant and center mainly on device delivery and imaging. In contrast to open surgical therapy which employs a combination of techniques, transcatheter approaches have not yet successfully combined these different techniques, and, thus, complex pathologies are hard to correct.

Although many different strategies and devices have been developed, only three have received European (CE Mark) approval to date. These are the MitraClip (Abbott Vascular, Irvine, CA), NeoChord DS 1000 (NeoChord, Inc., Louis Park, MN), and Carillon Mitral Contour System (Cardiac Dimensions, Inc., Kirkland, WA). MitraClip has also received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for commercial sale in the United States, but only for patients with primary MR who are at high risk for surgical repair. Other devices are in various stages of development.

Some devices such as the MitraClip have been employed to treat both primary and secondary MR. Most, however, have been designed to treat only one etiology or the other, with the majority devoted to secondary MR because of the larger clinical need and the existence of excellent surgical repair techniques for primary disease. We will first review the procedures and devices for the management of primary mitral disease.

## **Primary Mitral Regurgitation**

#### PERCUTANEOUS EDGE-TO-EDGE REPAIR

The MitraClip system is the only device with extensive clinical application, now with over 19,000 implantations worldwide. The MitraClip mimics the surgical edge-to-edge repair technique of Alfieri (Fig. 41-1). The device received CE approval in 2008, and FDA approval in 2013. However, the FDA approved the MitraClip only for primary MR in high surgical risk patients and not for patients with secondary MR.

The MitraClip system is designed to allow off-pump endovascular reconstruction of the regurgitant MV. It includes a clip device (MitraClip) and a steerable guiding catheter that enables placement of the clip on the free edges of the MV leaflets. The clip ensures permanent leaflet approximation and creates a double orifice MV (Fig. 41-2). The procedure is performed percutaneously via the femoral vein with transseptal puncture in a cardiac catheterization laboratory or in a hybrid suite with echocardiographic guidance under general

![](_page_1_Picture_14.jpeg)

anesthesia. The addition of three-dimensional and X-plane echocardiography has significantly facilitated the procedure, as the improved visualization allows for more accurate Mitra-Clip positioning (Fig. 41-3).

Without any strict recommendations from the manufacturer on type or duration of postoperative antiplatelet therapy, several anticoagulation regimens have been proposed. In the Everest I and II trials, aspirin 325 mg daily for 6 months to 1 year was implemented with 75 mg of clopidogrel daily for 1 month. <sup>14-16</sup> In Europe 100 mg of aspirin daily for 3 months and 75 mg of clopidogrel daily without a loading dose for 4 weeks are more commonly used. <sup>14,17</sup>

The primary benefit associated with the use of the Mitra-Clip is reduction of MR with elimination of the needs for open chest surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass, and cardiac arrest. The potential risks include those associated with cardiac catheterization and transseptal puncture. The major concern regarding this technique is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of a procedure that results in a less complete correction of MR than is usually accomplished surgically. This concern is based on the knowledge that surgical edgeto-edge repair without annuloplasty is associated with a higher rate of recurrent severe regurgitation if the residual MR is greater than 1+ postoperatively.<sup>18</sup> Whether partial reduction of MR is sufficient to translate into ventricular reverse remodeling and, more importantly, any clinical benefit remains to be determined. 9,11 Additional concerns have been raised regarding the potential impairment of the ability to perform a subsequent surgical valve repair should this become necessary. 19-21

There is a recent trend to implant multiple clips during a single procedure to achieve better coaptation and, thus, improved outcomes. <sup>22</sup> Of note, there have been very few reports of mitral stenosis necessitating intervention following MitraClip repair. <sup>23,24</sup> Even after multiple clip implantations in the same patient, mitral stenosis has rarely occurred.

MitraClip has undergone significant clinical testing. In the initial clinical feasibility trial (Everest I: Endovascular Valve Edge-to-Edge REpair STudy), 55 patients were enrolled, and both the safety and efficacy of the device were demonstrated. The pivotal Everest II trial was a multicenter randomized controlled trial to evaluate the benefits and risks of MVR using the MitraClip device compared with open MV surgery in 279 relatively low-risk patients with moderate or severe MR. It was conducted as a per-protocol analysis on a noninferiority hypothesis. Although transfusion was the major component of the composite safety endpoint in the surgical arm, the device met the safety noninferiority hypothesis criteria even if transfusion was eliminated. The primary effectiveness endpoint was determined as freedom from the combined outcome of death, MV surgery or reoperation, and MR greater than 2+ at 12 months. The trial also met the clinical success noninferiority hypothesis, which set a prespecified margin of 31%, at 12 months. The clinical success rate in the device group was 72.4% compared with 87.8% in the control group, an absolute observed difference margin of 15.4%. However, most likely due to the early learning curve with this device, acute procedural success (MR ≤ 2+ at discharge) was achieved in only 77% of patients, and 21% required subsequent open MV surgery. Ultimately, the Everest II trial showed that the MitraClip is safer, particularly by reducing the frequency of postoperative transfusions, but not as effective in reducing MR as compared to conventional MV surgery.<sup>25</sup>

The EVEREST II High-Risk Registry and REALISM Continued Access Study High-Risk Arm investigated the outcome of MitraClip therapy in 351 high-risk patient with 3 to 4+ MR. MR was reduced to ≤2+ in 86% of patients at discharge. Despite a mean STS-predicted operative mortality risk of 11.3 ± 7.7% for mitral replacement, the Kaplan-Meier freedom from death was 77.2% at 12 months. Freedom from MV surgery was 97.8% over this interval, even though 16.4% of patients had MR > 2+ at 12 months. This result

may have been inflated, however, by the high operative risk in these patients.

Since MitraClip was approved in Europe, several registries have demonstrated high rates of procedural success and favorable short-term outcomes. The Transcatheter Mitral Valve Interventions (TRAMI) Registry with 1064 patients (71% with secondary MR) showed that the procedure can be performed at a high success rate (95% device success) with no procedural deaths in a high-risk patient cohort (median STS mortality score 10; 69% of the patients with LVEF <50%).<sup>27</sup> In the ACCESS-EU registry, the MitraClip was implanted in 567 patients at 14 sites.<sup>28</sup> The mean logistic EuroSCORE was 23%, and 77% of patients had secondary MR. Multiple clips were used in 40% of patients. MR was reduced to ≤2+ in 91% of patients without any procedural deaths. NYHA class and 6-minute walk distance had both improved at 1-year follow-up. The European Sentinal Pilot Registry, with a similar rate of secondary MR patients (71% of 628), confirms these results while maintaining high procedural success (95.4%) and low mortality rates (inhospital mortality 2.9%). Although the rehospitalization for heart failure was more common in the secondary MR group (25.8 vs 12.0%, p = .009), recurrence of severe MR was present only in 6% of patients at 1 year following the procedure.29

The current guidelines are largely influenced by the encouraging results of these clinical trials. The 2012 ESC/EACTS Valve and HF guidelines provide a class IIb (LOE C) recommendation to consider MitraClip use in symptomatic patients with both severe primary and secondary MR.<sup>30</sup> The patients need to be judged inoperable or at high surgical risk by a "heart team" and should have a life expectancy greater than 1 year. Patients with secondary MR additionally need to be under optimal medical therapy and cardiac resynchronization therapy, if indicated.

Despite the fact that MitraClip has CE mark approval in secondary MR and has achieved good results in the large European registries for this disease category, the FDA has approved MitraClip only for the treatment of patients with primary MR in high surgical risk patients. Thus, in the 2014 ACCF/AHA Valve guidelines, MitraClip is recommended with class IIb (LOE b) guidance for severe primary MR in symptomatic patients at prohibitive risk for MV surgery.<sup>31</sup>

The future role of MitraClip in the management of both primary and secondary MR remains unclear. Particularly, high-risk patients with secondary MR may benefit from MitraClip therapy. Three large ongoing randomized trials (COAPT, RESHAPE-HF, and Mitra-Fr) comparing Mitra-Clip plus guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) versus GDMT alone in secondary MR may further elucidate the optimal role for MitraClip. The results of these trials should be available by 2017. However, even in the healthiest subgroup of patients—those with primary MR, no annular calcification, and optimal initial medical MR reduction—freedom from recurrent MR is only 60% after 9 years if annuloplasty is not performed. This might be acceptable for

older or high-risk patients, but not for patients who are suitable for surgery.

### Leaflet Repair Using Artificial Chords

The NeoChord DS1000 device allows off-pump implantation of artificial neochordae to repair prolapsing or flail mitral leaflets. The access for this procedure is a left minithoracotomy through which a purse-string is placed at the apex of the beating heart. A delivery device that contains an infrared sensor to detect tissue supports optimal grasping of the free edge of the prolapsing leaflet. Via indirect visualization with 3D echo, a suture is passed through the grasped free edge of the leaflet. The two ends of this suture are then brought through the apex of the heart and tied on the epicardial surface (Fig. 41-4). Proper chordal length is determined by adjustment under direct transesophageal echocardiographic guidance. The chords can be appropriately lengthened or shortened based on the color jet seen on echo.

Current experience with the NeoChord DS1000 is limited to slightly more than 100 patients. The Transapical Artificial Chordae Tendinae feasibility trial showed acute procedural success in 26 out of 30 patients (86.7%), deemed as overall reduction of MR from  $\geq$ 3+ to  $\leq$ 2+. Four patients (13.3%) had to be converted to conventional MV repair.<sup>34</sup> At 30-day follow-up, only 17 patients maintained MR grade  $\leq$ 2+, and four patients with recurrent MR had surgical MV repair during the 30-day follow-up. Results improved with experience: durable reduction in MR to  $\leq$ 2+ at 30 days was achieved in 5 (33.3%) of the first 15 patients and 12 (85.7%) of the last

14 patients. Furthermore, the implantation of two or three chords led to an improved MR reduction, which has been similarly demonstrated in the surgical loop technique. Larger studies are needed to prove efficacy and durability of this technique. Of note, a technique to perform edge-to-edge repair with this device may be under development.

### Secondary Mitral Regurgitation

#### MITRAL ANNULAR REMODELING TECHNIQUES

Although there is dilatation of the entire mitral annulus in patients with secondary MR, the greatest degree of dilation is in the posterior annulus and the greatest increase in dimension is in the septal-lateral (or anterior-posterior) diameter.<sup>8,35</sup> Therefore, secondary MR is most commonly surgically managed by reduction in the septal lateral diameter of the dilated mitral annulus by an undersized, complete, and rigid annuloplasty ring. A key element of this surgical repair includes anchoring a complete ring to the central fibrous skeleton of the heart at the fibrous trigones because anchoring the ring away from the mitral annulus in the atrial wall or in the leaflet tissue leads to less effective reduction in annular dimensions. Similarly, it has been well proven in the surgical arena that a partial posterior annuloplasty is less effective in annular reduction to treat MR. 36-38 On the other hand, correction of the septal lateral diameter by as little as 5 to 8 mm has been demonstrated to reconstitute leaflet coaptation and improve MR. Transcatheter approaches to secondary MR are based on this concept of mitral annulus remodeling to decrease the septal lateral diameter. There is no shortage of novel strategies to accomplish this goal (see Table 41-1). Some devices take advantage of the anatomical relationship between the coronary sinus and posterior mitral annulus; other devices take a more direct approach by plicating the posterior annulus; still others rely on distraction of the LV or left atrial walls to decrease the septal lateral diameter.

## Coronary Sinus Annuloplasty

Its proximity to the posterior mitral annulus makes the coronary sinus an attractive access point for placement of devices to remodel the mitral annulus (Fig. 41-5).<sup>39-43</sup> The ease of transvenous access led to early optimism. However, variability in the anatomic relationship of the coronary sinus to the mitral annulus has made it a challenge to obtain consistent decreases in annular dimensions. Although the coronary sinus is most commonly located adjacent to the posterior annulus, it is frequently located along the free wall of the left atrium, superior to the mitral annulus therefore relying on traction on the left atrial free wall for annular remodeling. 44,45 The smallest distance between the coronary sinus and the mitral annulus is usually at the entry to the sinus. Separation of the coronary sinus from the mitral annulus is maximal at the posterolateral commissure, as demonstrated in an anatomical study by Miselli of coronary sinus anatomy in 61 human cadaver hearts. 46 In this cohort, the distance between the inferior border of the coronary sinus and the mitral annulus at the P2 and

![](_page_5_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 41-5** Concept of a posterior mitral annulus plication performed by a device placed through the coronary sinus.

P3 mitral segments averaged 9.7 mm. It is important to note that in patients with severe MR, the distance between the coronary sinus and the mitral annulus is usually much greater than in patients without severe regurgitation. In addition, the path of the circumflex coronary artery and/or its branches between the coronary sinus and mitral annulus is of significant concern. The left circumflex artery or major branches have been reported to course between the coronary sinus and the mitral annulus in up to 80% of patients (Fig. 41-6). 46 Due to all of these concerns, the Carillon Mitral Contour System, a fixed-length device designed for plication of the coronary sinus between deployable anchors placed via internal jugular access, is the only remaining device employing the coronary sinus approach. Its proximal anchor is released near the coronary sinus ostium, and its distal one is deployed near the anterior commissure, deep on the coronary sinus. In case of insufficient MR reduction, the device can be repositioned.

In the AMADEUS feasibility study, the device was successfully implanted in 30 of the 48 enrolled patients (62.5%).<sup>47</sup> In these patients the mitral annular diameter was significantly reduced, leading to MR reduction by at least 1 grade and improvement in functional class at 2-year follow-up. In the TITAN trial, which investigated a second-generation device, 36 of 53 patients underwent successful device implantation (67%).<sup>48</sup> In both studies a high number of patients (17% in the AMADEUS, 15% in the Titan trial) did not receive the device due to unwanted interaction with the left circumflex artery. In the remaining patients with unsuccessful intervention, the Carillon device was retrieved, as it did not reduce MR by at least one grade. The major adverse events rate in the two studies decreased from 13 to 1.9%, but, due to low success rates, limited reversal in LV remodeling, and lack of control groups, the results of the initial Carillon Mitral Contour System trials remain controversial.<sup>49</sup>

## Direct Mitral Annular Remodeling

There are a number of devices designed to remodel the mitral annulus by direct plication. The Mitralign system (Mitralign, Inc., Tewksbury, MA) consists of polyester pledgets, a suture, and a stainless steel lock. A suture-based plication of the posterior annulus is placed retrograde through the aortic valve on the ventricular side of the mitral annulus. Two sutures are placed to plicate P1-P2 and P2-P3 (Fig. 41-7). Sixty-one patients were enrolled in the EU study for CE mark approval which was completed in 2014. In 45 patients (73.8%), the device was implanted with improvement in MR, quality of life, and NYHA classification at 30-day follow-up. A larger implant with a 50% increase in cinching distance, which may result in a stronger annulus diameter reduction and enhanced outcome, is now available, but CE mark approval is pending.

Another device, the Valtech Cardioband (Valtech, Inc., Tel Aviv, Israel), places a tensioning band with anchoring screws placed into the mitral annulus via a transseptal atrial access. <sup>52</sup> The tensioning band is then adjusted under echocardiographic

guidance until the regurgitant jet disappears as leaflet coaptation is restored. Early results of a multicenter study involving 29 symptomatic patients with moderate-to-severe secondary MR showed a 100% successful implant rate and 93% acute MR reduction postoperatively with sustained results over 6 months (91% MR  $\leq$  2+). <sup>53</sup> Both 6-minute walk test and NYHA classification improved in 11 patients (37.9%) at 6-month follow-up, but improvement did not reach statistical significance. CE mark approval is still pending for the Valtech Cardioband.

## Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement

Perhaps the most intriguing concept currently for the percutaneous treatment of secondary MR is transcatheter MV replacement (TMVR). One of the disadvantages of surgical annuloplasty for secondary MR is the recurrence of regurgitation in approximately one third of patients by one year. Even if the annuloplasty performed by a surgical or percutaneous approach leads to complete correction of MR at the time of the index procedure, the ongoing ventricular disease process may eventually cause further dilation of the ventricle. This leads to further tethering of the papillary muscles and free edges of the leaflets, resulting in return of MR some time after repair. In fact, the recurrence rate at 12 months after MVR is reported to be higher as compared to MV replacement (32.6 vs 2.3%).54 MV replacement, instead of repair, could theoretically prevent recurrence of MR even if further left ventricular dilation occurs after the procedure because LV dilatation should not affect an implanted prosthesis.

After the TAVR evolution, rapid adoptation of TMVR was anticipated. However, the development of TMVR has been delayed by the complex structure of the MV, composed of the left ventricular outflow tract, ventricular myocardium, papillary muscles, chordae, and native MV leaflets. Because the MV is a much more complex structure than the AV, many different variables must be considered during TMVR in comparison to the relatively straightforward TAVR technique. Most importantly, unlike the aortic annulus in aortic

stenosis, the mitral annulus is not calcified in MR, so there is no good anchoring zone for the implanted valve. However, the solid ring structure of a biological MV prosthesis or complete annuloplasty ring can be an ideal anchoring zone for a TAVR valve to be placed in the mitral location. Thus, in recent years, valve-in-valve (VinV) and valve-in-ring (VinR) procedures have become routine in many centers worldwide for high-risk patients. Both, VinV and VinR can be performed safely with transapical or transfemoral access. 55-59 But, without prior surgical MV or annuloplasty ring implantation, fixation of a TMVR is difficult.

Several devices have been developed to perform TMVR, of which some have recently initiated compassionate and early feasibility human trials and others have yet to initiate trials. These include the CardiAQ device (CardiAQ Valve Technologies, Inc., Winchester, MA), the Tiara device (Neovasc, Inc., Richmond, BC, Canada), the Tendyne device (Tendyne Medical, Inc., Roseville, MN), and the Fortis transapical device (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA).

The CardiAQ is a self-expanding, stent-based, bovine pericardial bioprosthesis. The device self-anchors without radial force and grabs the native MV leaflets (Fig. 41-8a). In 2012, it was the first TMVR device to reach human implantation using a transfemoral/transseptal access. After redesign, the second-generation CardiAQ device was implanted transapically in three patients 2014. The CE mark trial with 100 patients at 10 sites is anticipated to start in early 2015. 60

The Tiara device is a self-expanding, nitinol-based, bovine pericardial bioprosthesis (Fig. 41-8b). It can be implanted transapically, facilitated by a 32F sheathless system. The device captures the native mitral leaflets and has a full atrial skirt to minimize paravalvular leak. The D shape of the valve could help to prevent LV outflow obstruction. After three successful implantations in the first-in-man (FIM) trial, the TIARA-I feasibility study started in late 2014. 61,62

The Tendyne device is an apical, self-expanding, nitinol-based, porcine pericardial bioprosthesis with a ventricular tethering fixation system anchoring the valve to the left ventricular apex (Fig. 41-8c). It is fully retrievable and repositionable, and it is available in multiple sizes. After three patients

were successfully treated under a compassionate use protocol, the device was implanted in the first patient of an early feasibility study in November 2014. The patient recovered quickly and was released from the hospital on day 5.63

The Fortis transapical device is composed of a cloth-covered nitinol stent with three anticalcification-treated bovine pericardial leaflets. At present, only the 29 mm size valve is available, suitable for patients with a native annular diameter (A2-P2) between 30 and 44 mm. Valve fixation is performed by two paddles that capture the mitral leaflets. An atrial flange is designed to prevent paravalvular leaks. Rapid pacing is not necessary because normal blood flow is maintained throughout the entire procedure. All seven reported implantations of the Fortis device have led to a MR Grade ≤1+. One of the patients died after a partial displacement of the valve because the posterior paddle failed to capture the posterior mitral leaflet. Enrollment for a clinical feasibility study started in August 2014.<sup>64,65</sup>

#### CONCLUSION

There are a host of unique and intriguing concepts for transcatheter treatment of MR. Although progress in the transcatheter treatment of aortic stenosis was rapid and promising,

progress with MR has been much slower due to the complex MV anatomy, the variable MR pathologies, the necessity for complex delivery systems, the limited early success in clinical trials, and the existence of an effective, established therapy (open surgery). In addition, proper trial design has proven to be challenging, with the demonstration of clinical benefit remaining particularly difficult. However, the clinical unmet need is sizable, and with a host of unique concepts under early investigation, significant progress can be expected in the near future. The MV will be one of the most interesting targets for therapeutic cardiac device innovations in the coming years.
