# Mitral Valve Replacement

Tsuyoshi Kaneko • Maroun Yammine • Dan Loberman • Sary Aranki

This chapter discusses the surgical indications, operative techniques, and early and late follow-up after implantation of mechanical and bioprosthetic mitral valve devices. The valves that are discussed are those that are currently (2015) approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Figure 42-1 shows the former and current FDA-approved prosthetic mechanical mitral valve devices, including the Starr-Edwards ball-and-cage valve (historical relevance only), the Omnicarbon tilting-disk valve, the Medtronic Hall tilting-disk valve, the St. Jude Medical bileaflet valve, the Carbomedics bileaflet valve, the ATS bileaflet valve, and the On-X bileaflet valve. The FDA-approved bioprosthetic valve devices are shown in Fig. 42-2 and include the Hancock II porcine valve, the Carpentier-Edwards porcine valve, the Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valve, the Mosaic porcine valve, and the Biocor porcine valve.

Heart valve prostheses are continually undergoing iterative advancement by the manufacturers; however, the ideal valve has yet to be developed. This ideal replacement prosthesis would have longevity of a mechanical prosthesis combined with the superior hemodynamic function of the native biologic tissue valve. As a result, this hypothetical ideal replacement device would not require lifetime anticoagulation and carries no risk of either thromboembolic events or valve thrombosis. Achieving this goal will require major advancements to currently available designs.

## INDICATIONS FOR MITRAL VALVE REPLACEMENT

The indications for mitral valve replacement (MVR) are variable and undergoing evolution. Because of increasing use of reparative techniques, particularly for mitral regurgitation (MR), replacement or repair of a mitral valve often depends on the experience of the operating surgeon. Current indications for valve replacement pertain to the types of valve problems that are unlikely to be repaired by most surgeons or which have been shown to have poor long-term success after reconstruction. Indications are discussed according to (1) pathophysiologic states and (2) type of valve required (ie, mechanical or bioprosthetic).

#### **MITRAL STENOSIS**

Mitral stenosis (MS) is almost exclusively caused by rheumatic fever even though a definite clinical history can be obtained in only about 50% of patients. The incidence of MS has decreased substantially in the United States in the last several decades because of effective prophylaxis of rheumatic fever; nevertheless, in certain developing countries MS is still very common. Two-thirds of patients with rheumatic MS are females.

The pathologic changes associated with rheumatic valvulitis are mainly fusion of the valve leaflets at the commissures, shortening and fusion of the cordae tendineae, and thickening of the leaflets owing to fibrosis with subsequent stiffening, contraction, and calcification. Approximately 25% of patients have pure MS, but an additional 40% have combined MS and MR.<sup>1</sup>

Stenosis usually develops one or two decades after the acute illness of rheumatic fever with no or slow onset of symptoms until the stenosis becomes more severe. Limitation of exercise tolerance usually is the first symptom, followed by dyspnea that can progress to pulmonary edema. New-onset atrial fibrillation and the risk for thromboembolism, hemoptysis, and pulmonary hypertension are other common symptoms in patients with MS.

Besides echocardiographic imaging, the diagnostic workup of the symptomatic patient with MS should include a complete cardiac catheterization, including coronary angiography in any patient older than 40 years old. In younger patients, echocardiographic assessment of the mitral valve suffices in most symptomatic patients unless there is a history of chest pain or coronary artery disease. Typically echocardiogram establishes the extent of MS by determining valve gradients and valve area, but in complex cases cardiac catheterization with direct measurement might be more beneficial.

Recently published 2014 American Heart Association/ American College of Cardiology guideline has a new staging system for MS.<sup>2</sup> The criteria for severe MS has changed from mitral valve area of 1.0 cm<sup>2</sup> or less to a mitral valve area of 1.5 cm<sup>2</sup>, the normal native mitral valve area being 4 to 6 cm<sup>2</sup>, and/or a diastolic half pressure time more than 150 ms. Symptomatic severe MS is considered stage D while asymptomatic severe MS is stage C. Finally, a mitral valve area of less than 1.0 cm<sup>2</sup> or diastolic half pressure time more than 220 ms is considered "very severe MS."

Currently, the first option for MS is percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty and certain anatomic characteristics allow a more successful valvuloplasty (Table 42-1).<sup>2</sup> The Wilkins score is used to predict the success rates of this procedure by taking into consideration valve thickness, valvular calcification, leaflet mobility, and subvalvular thickening. Each category has a score of 1 to 4 and a total score of 8 or less predicts higher success rate with balloon valvuloplasty. If the score is higher than 8, MVR is recommended.<sup>3</sup> Subsequently, the 2014 ACC/AHA guidelines gave class I recommendation for

mitral valve surgery in severely symptomatic patients (NYHA class III/IV) with severe MS (stage D) who are not high risk for surgery and who are not candidates for previous balloon valvuloplasty or have failed a previous balloon valvuloplasty and in patients with severe MS (stage C or D) undergoing other cardiac surgery. Class IIa recommendation is given for severely symptomatic patients (NYHA class III/IV) with severe MS (stage D) provided there are other operative indications and Class IIb recommendation for patients with moderate MS (MVA 1.6-2.0 cm²) undergoing other cardiac surgery and patients with severe MS (stages C and D) who have had recurrent embolic events while receiving adequate anticoagulation. We must also mention that the degree of pulmonary artery pressure elevation secondary to MS continues to be

an area of concern for the mitral valve surgeon but it has been known for more than 40 years that after MVR for MS, pulmonary artery pressure decreases within hours in most patients and decreases more gradually over weeks to months in others.<sup>4-6</sup>

Historically, the success with closed commissurotomy after World War II and the development of the Starr-Edwards

valve in the early 1960s led to an enormous increase in operations for rheumatic mitral valve disease. It was until the 1990s that the balloon dilation of fibrotic stenotic mitral valves became increasingly common.<sup>6-8</sup> Open mitral commissurotomy and valvuloplasty also became an alternative for MS patients, <sup>9,10</sup> but some studies have shown better long-term

results with MVR using a mechanical valve.<sup>11</sup> Many patients with chronic MS now require valve replacement because the valve has developed significant dystrophic changes including marked thickening and shortening of all chordae, obliteration of the subvalvular space, agglutination of the papillary muscles, and calcification in both annular and leaflet tissue. Aggressive decalcification and heroic reconstructive techniques for these extremely advanced pathologic valves generally have produced poor long-term results; nevertheless, some surgeons still advocate aggressive repairs in this subset of patients.<sup>12</sup>

#### MITRAL REGURGITATION

The etiology of MR is very diverse and the decision to operate on patients with MR is more complex than for patients with MS, except in patients with acute ischemic MR and endocarditis in whom indications are more straightforward. The pathologic events that produce MR are related to a number of metabolic, functional, and anatomical abnormalities. These can be categorized into degenerative (eg, mitral prolapse and ruptured/elongated chordae), rheumatic, infectious, and ischemic diseases of the mitral valve. The recent AHA/ACC guideline separates MR into primary MR and secondary MR and is later graded based on patient symptoms and severity of the disease.<sup>2</sup>

The preferred surgical approach for primary MR is mitral valve repair which is described in a different chapter in this book. Mitral valve surgery has class I recommendation for symptomatic severe MR with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) over 30% or asymptomatic severe MR with decreased LVEF (30-60%). It is important to stress that depressed ejection fraction is a poor indicator of left ventricular function in patients with MR. Ejection fraction can be preserved in patients with irreversible left ventricular failure because of regurgitant flow through the valve. 13,14 Depressed cardiac function (LVEF < 40%) therefore usually indicates severe left ventricular dysfunction, and results of surgery are not as favorable in these patients as they are in those with normal ventricles.<sup>15,16</sup> Measurements of end-systolic volume and diameter have lately surfaced as more reliable noninvasive parameters to evaluate the status of the left ventricle and determine the optimal time for operation.<sup>17,18</sup> Therefore, LV end-systolic diameter over 40 mm is also considered Class I indication in patients with asymptomatic MR.

Mitral valve repair is indicated in patients with primary MR due to a degenerative prolapsing myxomatous valve especially if the prolapse is generalized and local findings that decrease the probability of a successful repair are absent. When the probability of successful repair is low as is the case with the encounter of rheumatic MR, calcific deposits throughout the leaflet substance and shortened chordae and papillary muscles, MVR is often the most

prudent operation.<sup>24</sup> However, good results with reconstructive surgery in this patient group have been reported.<sup>25</sup> In patients with endocarditis, MVR may be required because of destruction of the valve leaflets, subvalvular mechanisms and annular abscess formation. Although repair of the valve and avoidance of prosthetic material are very desirable in septic situations, the extent of the destruction may preclude repair. Therefore, MVR is required after careful debridement of the infectious tissue and reconstruction of the valve annulus.<sup>26-28</sup>

For secondary MR, severe secondary MR in the setting of cardiac procedure has Class IIa, and symptomatic severe secondary MR has class IIb recommendation to undergo mitral valve surgery. Recently published randomized control study that compared MVR and MV repair in patients with severe ischemic MR showed no difference in mortality and LV remodeling.<sup>29</sup> However, MV repair group had 33% recurrence of moderate or severe MR compared to 2% in MVR. Other specific findings that preclude satisfactory repair include restrictive valve motion from shortened, scarred papillary muscles, acutely infarcted papillary muscle, and rupture of chordae associated with extensive calcification of valve leaflets.<sup>30-32</sup>

#### **CHOICE OF VALVE TYPE**

## Indications for Mechanical Valve Replacement

For young patients, patients in chronic atrial fibrillation who require long-term anticoagulation, and any patient who wants to minimize the chance of reoperation, a mechanical prosthetic valve should be chosen if valve replacement is required. The St. Jude Medical bileaflet valve is the most widely used prosthetic mitral valve at present because it has good hemodynamic characteristics and is easy to insert. Recent interest in the On-X mechanical valve relates primarily to the possibility for limited anticoagulation, although this remains to be borne out from current clinical trial.<sup>33</sup> Indications to choose one prosthetic or another vary primarily by surgeon preference and occasionally depending on the state of the annulus and whether or not there have been multiple previous operations. The most recent 2014 AHA/ ACC guideline has changed its recommendation from class I recommendation of mechanical valve in age 65 years to "shared decision-making process with patients preferences and risks of reoperation."2 There is a class IIa recommendation for mechanical valves in patients under age 60 years and either bioprostheses or mechanical prostheses for age between 60 and 70 years.

We have performed a propensity matching analysis in patients younger than 65 years who underwent MVR. Our results showed higher reoperation rate in bioprostheses group and higher survival in mechanical prostheses group (11 vs 13 years, p = .004; Fig. 42-3). Therefore, we recommend mechanical prosthesis in this patient group.<sup>34</sup>

## Indications for Bioprosthetic Valve Replacement

Patients in any age group in sinus rhythm who wish to avoid anticoagulation may prefer a bioprosthetic valve. Recent 2014 AHA/ACC guideline gave Class I recommendation for bioprostheses in patients at any age in whom anticoagulation therapy is contraindicated, cannot be managed appropriately or is not desired. A bioprosthetic valve is preferred in patients greater than age 65 years and in sinus rhythm because these valves deteriorate more slowly in older patients.<sup>35</sup> In addition, some 60-year-old patients may not outlive their prosthetic valves because of coexisting comorbidities. 36,37 Specifically, patients who require combined MVR and coronary bypass grafting for ischemic MR and coronary artery disease have a significantly reduced long-term survival as compared to patients who do not have concomitant coronary artery disease.<sup>38-43</sup> In these individuals with little risk of reoperation, anticoagulation may better be avoided.

As 20-year results have become available for various bioprostheses, it is clear that structural valve degeneration (SVD) is the most prominent complication of these valves. 44-49 The durability of porcine mitral valves is less than that of aortic bioprostheses which is directly proportional to age. 45 Deterioration occurs within months or years in children and young adults and only gradually over years in septuagenarians and octogenarians. 44,50 Essentially, all valves implanted into patients younger than 60 years of age have to be replaced ultimately, and valve failure is prohibitively rapid in children and adults younger than 35 to 40 years of age; therefore, bioprostheses are not advisable in these age groups.<sup>51</sup> Nevertheless, there are still indications for mitral porcine bioprosthetic valves in young patients. In a woman who desires to become pregnant, a bioprosthesis may be used to avoid warfarin anticoagulation and fetal damage during pregnancy. 52-55

Over the last decade several publications, mainly from European centers, reported on the use of unstented cryopreserved homografts<sup>56-59</sup> and stentless heterografts<sup>60-63</sup> for MVRs, particularly in patients with endocarditis. The prosthetic valve is transplanted so that donor papillary muscles are reattached to recipient papillary muscles and the annulus is sutured circumferentially. This technique has been shown to be safe and reproducible, but it does not always provide durable results and therefore should not be used in young patients.<sup>60</sup> Other reports suggest that these operations may be a feasible alternative to stented valve replacement in patients with endocarditis. Pulmonary autografts also have been used for replacing the mitral valve (Ross II procedure), but these series are small, and follow-up is relatively short.<sup>64-66</sup>

#### TRENDS IN MITRAL VALVE SURGERY

Mitral valve surgery has been in a state of constant evolution since its inception. Data regarding all cardiac surgical procedures reported to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (STS ACSD) demonstrate this dynamic state as more surgeons begin to repair rather

than replace mitral valves. Gammie et al evaluated trends in mitral valve surgery in the United States using the STS ACSD evaluating the years between 2000 and 2007.<sup>67</sup> In this time period, 210,529 mitral valve procedures were performed in all settings. From the study population, 58,370 patients undergoing primary mitral valve operations were identified. Over this 7-year study time line, a 50% increase in repair rates was documented. When considering the valve replacement, a 100% increase in use of bioprosthetic devices coincided with a decline in the use of mechanical valves.

Gammie and coworkers identified clear trends with respect to patient selection as well. Compared with patients undergoing mitral valve repair, those undergoing mitral replacement tended to be older, females, more likely to have multiple comorbidities (eg, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic lung disease, stroke), concomitant tricuspid valve disease, MS, and were less likely to be asymptomatic. With respect to survival, overall risk adjusted mortality was lower for mitral valve repair versus replacement (OR 0.52, 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.59, p < .0001). The outcome with respect to choice of valve type and survival was not addressed but was felt to be confounded by patient factors that led to the initial device selection.

## HEMODYNAMICS OF MITRAL VALVES DEVICES

### **Mechanical Prostheses**

The designs of mechanical and bioprosthetic heart valves have evolved over the last five decades in an effort to develop the ideal replacement device for the pathologic mitral valve. The optimal heart valves exert minimal resistance to forward blood flow and allow only trivial regurgitant backflow as the occluder closes. The design must cause minimal turbulence and stasis in vivo under physiologic flow conditions. The valve must be durable enough to last a lifetime and must be constructed of biomaterials that are nonantigenic, nontoxic, nonimmunogenic, nondegradable, and noncarcinogenic. The valve also must have a low associated incidence of thromboembolism.

The opening resistance to blood flow is determined by the orifice diameter; the size, shape, and weight of the occluder; the opening angle; and the orientation of leaflet or disk occluders with respect to the plane of the mitral annular orifice for any given annular size. Least resistance to transvalvular blood flow during diastole for valves in the mitral position is provided by a large ratio of orifice to total annular area. A wide opening angle also improves the effective orifice area and results in decreased

diastolic pressure gradients. Table 42-2 shows hemodynamic assessments of each of the FDA-approved mitral valve prostheses for the most commonly used mitral valve sizes.<sup>68-71</sup> The results of in vivo assessments at rest by invasive (catheterization) or noninvasive (Doppler echocardiography) techniques are tabulated.

Blood turbulence flowing across mitral valve devices results from impedance to forward or reverse flow. This impedance can be minimized by occluder design and orientation, central flow through the orifice and limited struts or pivots extending into flow areas (Fig. 42-4). Hemolysis is the product of

red blood cell destruction that is caused by cavitation and shearing stresses of turbulence, high-velocity flow, regurgitation, and mechanical damage during valve closure. Areas of perivalvular blood stagnation and turbulence increase platelet aggregation, activation of the coagulation proteins, and thrombus formation.

Dynamic regurgitation is a feature of all prosthetic valves and is the sum of the closing volume during occluder closure and the leakage volume that passes through the valve while it is closed. The closing volume is a function of the effective orifice area and the time needed for closure. Leakage volume is inherent to the design of the valve and depends on the amount of time the valve remains in the closed position.<sup>73</sup> A small amount of regurgitant volume can be beneficial by minimizing stasis and reducing platelet aggregation; this decreases the incidence of valve thrombosis and valve-related thromboembolism.

#### **BALL AND CAGE MECHANICAL VALVES**

Starr-Edwards. Introduced in 1965, the Starr-Edwards Model 6120 was the only ball-and-cage mitral valve prosthesis approved by the FDA; however, the production was discontinued in 2007 (see Fig. 42-1A). The occluder is a barium-impregnated Silastic ball in a Stellite alloy cage that projects into the left ventricle. This valve has a large Teflon/polypropylene sewing ring that produces a relatively smaller effective orifice and larger diastolic pressure gradients than other prosthetic valves of similar annular sizes. Leakage volumes are not inherent in the ball-and-cage design, and in contrast with other mechanical valves, the presence of regurgitation may indicate a pathologic process. The central ball occluder causes lateralization of forward flow and results in turbulence and cavitation that increase the risk of hemolysis and thromboembolic complications (see Fig. 42-4A). 74-76

#### MONOLEAFLET MECHANICAL VALVES

Medtronic-Hall. Tilting-disk mitral valve prostheses had better hemodynamic characteristics than ball-and-cage valves (see Fig. 42-4B) but with the development of new valve designs and technology they were taken off the market. The Medtronic Hall central pivoting-disk valve was available between 1977 and 2009 and it was based on engineering design modifications of the earlier Hall-Kaster valve<sup>77</sup> (see Fig. 42-1B). The opening angle of 70° produced regurgitation volumes of less than 5% of left ventricular stroke volume without significantly compromising forward flow. The disk occluder was allowed to slide out of the housing at the end of the closing cycle to provide a gap through which blood could flow to minimize stasis at the contact surfaces.<sup>78</sup> The large opening angle and slim disk occluder, along with a thinner sewing ring, provide improved hemodynamics with comparably larger effective orifice areas and lower mean diastolic pressure gradients for each valve size.

Omniscience-Omni Carbon. The Omniscience tiltingdisk valve was first introduced in 1978 as a second-generation device derived from improvements to the design of the Lillehei-Kaster pivoting-disk valve.<sup>79</sup> It had a larger orifice to annular ratio, a larger opening angle of 80° and better hemodynamics compared to its predecessor. A special disk design reduced the regurgitant volume, the turbulence and the areas of stasis and shear stress. Clinical studies, however, opened a huge debate concerning this valve's hemodynamics since there was reports of a postoperative mean opening angle between 44.8<sup>69</sup> and 75.9°.<sup>80</sup> Implicated factors causing this variation included valve sizing, orientation during implantation, and anticoagulation status. 80,81 A subsequent generation of the Omniscience valve is the all-carbon Omnicarbon monoleaflet valve that was released in 2001 in the United States but has been in clinical use in Europe since 1984 (see Fig. 42-1C). The housing material is made of pyrolytic carbon instead of titanium. As a result of this change, the incidence of thromboembolism, valvular thrombosis, and reparations was decreased significantly compared with the Omniscience valve prostheses.<sup>82</sup> Since 2005, however, the production of the Omnicarbon valve ended as the company decided to stop this production line.

Currently the only valve design available for implantation in the United States is the bileaflet design; it is being provided by many manufacturers.

#### **BILEAFLET MECHANICAL VALVES**

St. Jude Mechanical Valve. The unique design of the bileaflet St. Jude Medical valve was introduced in 1977, and it is currently the prosthesis used most commonly worldwide (see Fig. 42-1D). Two separate pyrolytic carbon semidisks in a pyrolytic carbon housing are attached to a Dacron sewing ring. The housing has two pivot guards that project into the left atrium. The bileaflet design produces three different flow areas through the valve orifice that provide overall a more uniform, central, and laminar flow than in the caged ball and monoleaflet tilting-disk designs. The improved flow results in less turbulence and decreased transmitral diastolic pressure gradients<sup>73,83</sup> (see Fig. 42-4C) at any annulus diameter size and cardiac output compared with the caged ball and single-leaflet tilting valves.<sup>84</sup> The favorable hemodynamics in smaller sizes makes it especially useful in children. The central opening angle is 85°, with a closing angle of 30 to 35°, which along with a thin sewing ring, provides a large effective orifice area for each valve size at the expense of greater regurgitant volumes, especially at low heart rates. Asynchronous closure of the valve leaflets in vivo also contributes to the regurgitant volume.85 The design of this prosthesis provides excellent hemodynamic function even in small sizes in any rotational plane.86 The antianatomical plane, however, with the central slit between the leaflets oriented perpendicular to the opening axis of the native valve leaflets decreases the potential risk of leaflet impingement by the posterior left ventricular wall.<sup>87</sup> Rotatable cuff designs are available on newer generation models.

Carbomedics Valve. The Carbomedics bileaflet valve was approved by the FDA in 1986 (see Fig. 42-1E). This lowprofile device is constructed of pyrolytic carbon and has no pivot guards, struts, or orifice projections to decrease blood flow impedance and turbulence through the valve.<sup>73</sup> It has a rotatable sewing cuff design and is available with a more generous and flexible sewing cuff (the OptiForm variant) that conforms more easily to different patient anatomies and allows subannular, intraannular, or supraannular suture placement. The leaflet opening angle is 78°, which with the bileaflet design provides a relatively large effective orifice area and transvalvular diastolic pressure differences only slightly greater than the St. Jude Medical bileaflet valve. Because of its narrow closing angle and large leakage volume, the Carbomedics valve does not reduce the relatively large regurgitant volume associated with the bileaflet design. Although this valve has good hemodynamic function overall, in the mitral position, the 25-mm Carbomedics valve has a relatively high diastolic pressure gradient and large regurgitant energy loss across the valve, especially at high flows. Hemodynamic

studies suggest that the Carbomedics valve should be avoided in patients with a small mitral valve orifice.<sup>73</sup>

Advancing the Standard (ATS) Valves. The ATS Open Pivot® bileaflet mechanical prosthesis has been in clinical use in the United States since 2000. Similar to the Carbomedics valve, the ATS valve is a low-profile bileaflet prosthesis with a pyrolytic housing and pyrolytic carbon leaflets containing graphite substrate (see Fig. 42-1F). The pivot areas are located entirely within the orifice ring, and the valve leaflets hinge on convex pivot guides on the carbon orifice ring. This design minimizes the overall height of the valve and provides a wider orifice area, and the absence of cavities in the valve ring theoretically reduces stasis or eddy currents that may develop. Valve noise, a bothersome problem for some patients, also is reduced by this design.87 The opening angle is up to 85°, and the sewing cuff is constructed of double velour polyester fabric that is mounted to a titanium stiffening ring, which enables the surgeon to rotate the valve orifice during and after implantation.

On-X Prosthesis Valves. The On-X prosthesis was approved by the FDA in 2002. It has a bileaflet design similar to the St. Jude Medical, Carbomedics, and ATS prostheses with comparable hemodynamic performance, that is, a relatively large orifice diameter and a wide opening angle (90°) (see Fig. 42-1G). Instead of silicon-alloyed pyrolytic carbon, as used in the other mechanical prostheses, the On-X valve is made of pure pyrolytic carbon. This material is stronger and tougher than silicon-alloyed carbon and allows incorporation of hydrodynamically efficient features into the valve orifice, such as increased orifice length and a flared inlet that reduces transvalvular gradient. Early clinical results are promising and the valve produces very little hemolysis with postoperative levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase in the normal range.<sup>88,89</sup>

## **Anticoagulation for Mechanical Valves**

Warfarin remains to be the mainstay of anticoagulation after mechanical valve replacement in both aortic and mitral positions.<sup>90</sup> The need for anticoagulation with mechanical valves has been the leading cause of people shying away from this type of valves because of the life style changes this treatment instills. In fact, this has also been a major driving force in the recently observed shift in use of the bioprosthetic valves in younger patients despite its decreased lifespan compared to mechanical valves. 90,91 Given the time needed to heparin-warfarin bridging as well as the frequent need of monitoring during Warfarin treatment, efforts are being made to find an alternative. The new oral anticoagulants (dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban ...) are promising substitutes to the warfarin therapy due to their shorter half life and the lack of need to constant monitoring.90 Those drugs have been FDA approved for use in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and in treatment or prevention of deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism but not for anticoagulation in

patients with mechanical valves. dabigatran was the only drug to be compared to warfarin in patients with mechanical valves during a phase 2 trial, the RE-ALIGN trial that was initiated in 2012. Unfortunately, this trial was terminated prematurely owing to an increase in stroke, myocardial infarction and major bleeding in the dabigatran group. The FDA declared, after this study, that dabigatran is contraindicated in this patient population. In the absence of other randomized controlled studies comparing a new oral anticoagulant to warfarin in patients with mechanical valves, warfarin still holds the crown of oral anticoagulation in this patient population.

## **Bioprostheses**

#### **PORCINE VALVES**

The porcine bioprosthetic mitral valves are designed to mimic the flow characteristics of the in situ aortic valve. The Hancock I mitral valve bioprosthesis was introduced in 1970. It has three glutaraldehyde-preserved porcine aortic valve leaflets on a polypropylene stent attached to a Dacron-covered silicone sewing ring. The design allows for central laminar flow through the valve, which tends to decrease diastolic pressure gradients and minimize turbulence. <sup>83</sup> The stent, however, impedes forward flow and results in relatively large diastolic pressure gradients across the bioprosthesis. The stent and the large sewing ring contribute to effective orifice areas that are smaller than those of size-matched mechanical valves (see Table 42-2).

The Hancock II porcine bioprosthesis (see Fig. 42-2A) is the more modern version of the Hancock I prosthesis. The stent is made of Delrin with a scalloped sewing ring and reduced stent profile. The leaflets are fixed in glutaraldehyde at low pressure then at high pressure for a prolonged period. To delay calcification, the leaflets are treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate.

The Carpentier-Edwards porcine valve uses a flexible stent to decrease the stress of leaflet flexion while maintaining its overall configuration (see Fig. 42-2B). The effective orifice-to-total-annulus-area ratio for the Carpentier-Edwards valve is relatively small, but exercise studies show that the effective orifice area increases significantly with increased blood flow across the valve; diastolic

gradients also increase but to a lesser degree. 70,71,93 Porcine bioprostheses in the mitral position should be avoided in patients with small left ventricles because of the possibility of ventricular rupture or left ventricular outflow obstruction caused by the large struts. 94

The Mosaic porcine bioprosthesis is a third-generation bioprosthesis using the Hancock II stent (see Fig. 42-2C). It was introduced in the United States in 2000 and has a Delrin stent, scalloped sewing ring, and reduced stent profile. The valve tissue is pressure-free fixed with glutaraldehyde, and the prosthesis is treated with alpha-oleic acid to retard calcification.

In 2005, the FDA approved the Biocor porcine bioprosthesis (St. Jude Medical) (see Fig. 42-2E); however, it has been used and investigated for almost two decades in Europe. It belongs to the third generation of bioprostheses, and the valve tissue is pretreated in glutaraldehyde at very low pressure (<1 mm Hg), making the valve cusps less stiff with less tendency to tissue fatigue. A newer generation of this valve, the St. Jude Medical Epic valve, is identical to its precursor except that the later is treated with Linx AC ethanol-based calcium mitigation therapy.

#### PERICARDIAL VALVES

Previous studies indicated poor durability of pericardial valves, namely the Ionescu-Shiley valve, caused by leaflet tearing. This led to significant changes in design, including mounting of the pericardium completely within the stent, causing less leaflet abrasion and increased durability. The Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valve uses bovine pericardium as material to fabricate a trileaflet valve and that is cut, fitted, and sewn onto a flexible Elgiloy wire frame for stress reduction (see Fig. 42-2D). The tissue is preserved with glutaraldehyde with no applied pressure and the leaflets are treated with the calcium mitigation agent XenoLogiX. Compared to the Carpentier-Edwards porcine bioprosthesis, the stent profile is reduced. Long-term durability for the Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valve is strong and compared to third-generation porcine valves, valve-related complications are similar (see Discussion later in this chapter).

Hemodynamically, pericardial valves provide the best solution to flow problems. The design maximizes use of the flow area, which results in minimal flow resistance. Figure 42-5A

![](_page_9_Figure_14.jpeg)

FIGURE 42-5 Flow patterns for bioprosthetic valves. (A) Pericardial bioprosthesis. (B) Porcine bioprosthesis.

shows how the cone shape of the open valve and circular valve orifice minimizes flow disturbance compared with the more irregular cone shape of the porcine valves that allow for central unimpeded flow (see Fig. 42-5B).

Structural valve deterioration is seen after long-term follow-up of patients with both porcine and pericardial bioprostheses and results in MS or MR or both. Hemodynamic studies early after operation and at 5 years reveal higher average diastolic pressure gradients and smaller effective orifice areas when compared in the same patients at the follow-up study. In some patients, these changes are sufficiently severe to require reoperation as soon as 4 to 5 years postoperatively and by 10 years the rate of primary tissue failure averages 30%. It then accelerates, and by 15 years postoperatively, the actuarial freedom from bioprosthetic primary tissue failure has ranged from 35 to 71%44,46,48,49,68 (Table 42-3). Most of these patients show hemodynamic evidence of valvular deterioration before any clinical signs or symptoms.<sup>71</sup> Bioprosthetic valves have the advantage of low thrombogenicity, which must be weighed against poor long-term durability and subsequent hemodynamic deterioration and the risk of reoperation.

#### **OPERATIVE TECHNIQUES**

# Preoperative Management and Anesthetic Preparation

Congestive heart failure (CHF) secondary to MS usually can be treated with aggressive diuretic therapy and sodium restriction preoperatively. If the patient is in rapid atrial fibrillation digoxin, beta blockers, and calcium channel antagonists can be used to slow down the ventricular rate. Patients with acute MR often are in cardiogenic shock, and they can be stabilized preoperatively with inotropes and arterial vasodilators to reduce systemic afterload. Intraaortic balloon counterpulsation also can be used for this purpose. Symptoms of CHF in patients with chronic MR are treated with diuretics and oral vasodilators. The vasodilators lower the peripheral vascular resistance, forward cardiac flow is hence increased and the regurgitant volume into the left atrium reduced.

Preferred anesthesia for MVR typically involves a combination of narcotic and inhalational agents. Ultimately, anesthetic management is dictated by the wide range of functional

disabilities and hemodynamic abnormalities of patients who present for  $\ensuremath{\mathsf{MVR}}.^{94}$ 

Preoperative intravenous prophylactic antibiotics are administered to all patients. Monitoring should include arterial and venous lines, a urinary catheter and a pulmonary artery catheter placed before bypass to measure pulmonary pressures and cardiac output. Transesophageal echocardiography is also critical throughout the entire operation. Last but not least, temporary ventricular pacing wires are placed postoperatively, and in many instances temporary atrial pacing wires are placed for possible pacing or diagnosis of various atrial arrhythmias.

### Cardiopulmonary Bypass for Mitral Valve Replacement

Cardiopulmonary bypass is instituted by placing two rightangled cannulas into the superior and inferior venae cavae. A small (22 French) plastic or metal cannula is placed directly into the superior vena cava, above the sinoatrial node. The inferior caval cannula is placed at the entrance of the inferior vena cava, low in the right atrium. These insertion sites keep the caval catheters out of the operative field and yet maintain excellent bicaval drainage. An arterial cannula is placed in the distal ascending aorta. Bypass flows are approximately 1.5 L/m<sup>2</sup> per minute, and mild hypothermia is used with vacuum-assisted suction. Myocardial protection includes antegrade and retrograde blood cardioplegia and profound myocardial hypothermia.<sup>95</sup> Retrograde cardioplegia is useful for all valve surgery to protect the ischemic left ventricle and help remove ascending aorta bubbles. Antegrade cardioplegia, used as an initial loading dose, is augmented by intermittent retrograde cardioplegia every 20 minutes. This provides safer delivery of cardioplegia because when the atrium is retracted during valve replacement, the aortic valve is distorted, and antegrade cardioplegia tends to fill the ventricle due to aortic regurgitation.

## **Exposure of the Mitral Valve**

Evolution of meticulous and complicated methods of mitral valve repair and reconstruction has required optimal exposure of the mitral valve. In primary operations, median sternotomy, development of Sondergaard's plane, and incision of the left atrium close to the atrial septum provide excellent exposure<sup>96,97</sup> (Fig. 42-6). This incision is a ubiquitous one, and occasionally other incisions, such as the superior approach through the dome of the left atrium, 98,99 the so-called biatrial incision popularized by Guiraudon and colleagues, 100 division of the superior vena cava 101,102 and the less common but occasionally useful trans-right atrial septal incision<sup>103</sup> are used to obtain exposure. The trans-right atrial incision has in some studies been related to higher incidence of junctional and nonsinus rhythm postoperatively, 104 although this has not been confirmed by other studies.78

### Intracardiac Technique

Operation entails secure fixation of a valve prosthesis to the annulus by reliable suture techniques without damage to adjacent structures or myocardium and without tissue interference with valve function. Implantation should prevent injury to anatomical structures surrounding the mitral valve annulus. Figure 42-7 shows the proximity of important cardiac structures near the mitral valve annulus. These include the circumflex coronary artery within the atrioventricular (AV) groove, the left atrial appendage, the aortic valve in continuity with the anterior mitral curtain and the AV node.

An accumulation of laboratory and clinical evidence indicates that preservation of papillary muscle-chordal attachments to the annulus is important for maintenance of left ventricular function. In patients with MS with agglutinated, fibrotic chordate, and papillary muscles, preservation of these structures probably has little effect on left ventricular dysfunction but does protect the AV groove from rupture by preserving the posterior leaflet. If fibrotic, placement of artificial Gore-Tex chordae to reattach the papillary muscles to the annulus may improve early and late preservation of cardiac output.<sup>21</sup> In patients with MR, however, it is important to preserve as much of the papillary muscle and annular interaction as possible. This can be achieved by a variety of techniques, as shown in Fig. 42-8. The anterior leaflet may be partially excised and brought to the posterior leaflet (see Fig. 42-8A) or can be partially excised and "furled" to the anterior annulus by a running Prolene suture 105,106 (see Fig. 42-8B).

Experimental and clinical evidence suggest that preservation of the conical shape of the ventricle is important to maintain normal cardiac output 107-110; cutting the papillary muscles is therefore deleterious to left ventricular function because it assumes more of a globular shape. Furthermore, preservation of the posterior leaflet and chordae has dramatically reduced the incidence of perforation of the left ventricle and AV separation during MVR. 10,111,112

Suturing techniques vary according to the type of valve that is implanted. The bioprosthetic valve is inserted preferentially with the sutures placed from ventricle to atrium (noneverting or subannular). This has been shown to be the strongest type of suturing technique to the mitral annulus and is used with this valve (Fig. 42-9A).

To ensure adequate function of bileaflet or tilting-disk valves, everting sutures (atrium to ventricle to sewing ring) should be used (see Fig. 42-9B). This technique pushes the prosthetic valve out into the center of the orifice and minimizes any tissue interference of the prosthetic valve leaflets. This is particularly important if annular-chordal attachments are preserved. Teflon-pledgeted sutures, particularly with the thin sewing rings of the currently available bileaflet and tilting-disk valves, should be used. If a bioprosthetic valve is inserted, a dental mirror is used to ensure that no annular suture is wrapped around a stent strut. A running Prolene suture for implantation of mitral valves has been advocated

by some surgeons.<sup>113,114</sup> This technique makes a very clean suture line with minimal knots but runs the risk of valve dehiscence if an infection occurs.<sup>115</sup>

Before closure, the left atrial appendage is ligated by suture or stapled to prevent clot formation in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, enlarged left atrium, or left atrial thrombus. <sup>116</sup> The atrium is closed by a running Prolene suture, making sure that endocardial surfaces are approximated. If needed, a left atrial catheter can be inserted through the suture line.

### ASSOCIATED OPERATIONS/ PROCEDURES

Coronary bypass is the most common procedure performed with MVR and the distal anastomosis should be performed first. This reduces lifting of the heart after the rigid mitral

![](_page_13_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 42-8** Techniques to maintain annular-papillary muscle continuity. (A) An ellipse is removed from the posterior leaflet, and a flap is cut from the central portion of the anterior leaflet. The anterior flap is flipped to the posterior annulus and tacked to the caudad edge of the posterior leaflet and the posterior annulus. Sutures anchoring the prosthesis include the annulus and anterior and posterior leaflet remnants to which chordae are attached. (B) The anterior leaflet is partially excised, and remnants are "furled" to the annulus by sutures used to insert the prosthesis.

valve prosthesis is in place, which can cause rupture of the myocardium or the AV groove. This also allows cardioplegia to be delivered through the bypass grafts.

Tricuspid valve repair or replacements usually are performed after replacing the mitral valve. In these cases, the mitral valve can be approached through the right atrium and a transseptal incision. After the mitral valve prosthesis is in place, the septum is closed, and the aortic cross-clamp is removed before proceeding with the tricuspid valve procedure. 117

When both the aortic and mitral valves are replaced at the same operation, most surgeons begin with excising the aortic valve before proceeding with the mitral valve procedure. It is extremely difficult to expose the mitral annulus especially the anterior annulus with aortic prosthesis in place. When excising the anterior mitral valve leaflet, care must be taken not to injure the aortic annulus and the intraannular region. The aortic valve then is sewn in after the mitral valve is in place.

## Weaning Off Cardiopulmonary Bypass

We use transesophageal echocardiography for every valve operation and particularly for mitral valves, where excellent images can be obtained. If transesophageal echocardiography is contraindicated (eg, because of esophageal disease), direct epicardial echocardiography can be used. The echocardiograms provide information about valve and left ventricular function, possible retained material in the left atrium including thrombus and removal of intracardiac air.

A careful de-airing at the end of the operation is essential and can be completed using special maneuvers. Rewarming the patient comes next and then venous return is partially occluded and the heart is gradually volume loaded. Pulmonary artery pressures are monitored carefully and pharmacologic agents, such as amrinone or dobutamine can be used particularly for right ventricular overload.

#### **POSTOPERATIVE CARE**

Postoperative care is directed toward the resumption of normal cardiac output, respiratory function, temperature control, electrolyte management, adequate renal flow and prophylaxis against bleeding. Patients with low cardiac output are managed with a variety of pharmacologic agents after providing adequate volume loading. Left atrial and especially pulmonary arterial catheters are of particular help in determining optimal balancing of volume loading and myocardial function in the first hours postoperatively.

In the intensive care unit, reduction in pulmonary interstitial fluid is aggressively pursued by diuretics in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension. Most patients with severe pulmonary hypertension can be extubated within 48 hours of surgery. Many patients with severe, longstanding mitral valve disease are cachectic and severely catabolic at the time of operation despite preoperative nutritional support. These patients generally require longer periods of ventilatory support owing to the lack of respiratory muscle strength. In patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and cardiac cachexia who require prolonged intubation, tracheostomy may be necessary to reduce ventilatory dead space and facilitate faster weaning and better pulmonary toilet.

Postoperative atrial arrhythmias are so common that their absence is unusual. Arrhythmias vary from rapid supraventricular tachycardias, usually atrial fibrillation, to junctional rhythm and heart block. These arrhythmias are treated by pharmacologic agents, pacemakers, or both. If rapid atrial fibrillation cannot be controlled pharmacologically and is destabilizing hemodynamically, emergency cardioversion is done to improve cardiac output. Pharmacologic management of supraventricular tachycardia usually is required but may precipitate the need for a prophylactic transvenous pacemaker if severe slowing of the heart rate occurs.

Anticoagulation is prescribed for all patients undergoing MVR with either a mechanical or bioprosthetic valve. In the first 6 weeks after operation, the incidence of atrial and other arrhythmias is high; thus, these fluctuating rhythms mandate anticoagulation even if the basic rhythm is sinus. In addition to rhythm concerns, the left atrial incisions and the possibility of stasis in the left atrial appendage justify full anticoagulation with warfarin for all patients. Some surgeons advocate immediate intravenous heparin until therapeutic warfarin doses can be reached. 118,119 Low molecular weight heparin also can be used. 120,121

The therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) after MVR is 2.5 to 3.5 depending on the type of valve, cardiac rhythm, and presence or absence of the aforementioned intraoperative risk factors for thromboembolism. 116,119,120 Anticoagulation levels are in the low range for patients in sinus rhythm who received tissue valves. Patients who have mechanical valves need lifelong anticoagulation. Patients who have bioprosthetic valves are evaluated at 6 to 12 weeks for cardiac rhythm abnormalities. If they are in predominantly sinus rhythm, warfarin is stopped, and one aspirin tablet is given daily indefinitely. If the patient has continuous atrial

fibrillation or fluctuating rhythms, anticoagulation with warfarin is continued. Warfarin usually is started on the second postoperative day. Addition of aspirin, 80 to 150 mg daily, to the warfarin may reduce the risk of thromboembolism<sup>122,123</sup> and may have a role in patients with prosthetic valves.<sup>124</sup>

#### **RESULTS**

### **Early Results**

The hospital mortality for MVR with and without coronary bypass grafting has decreased significantly since the inception of mitral valve surgery. The current risk (2006) of elective primary MVR with and without coronary bypass grafting is 5 to 9% in most studies (range 3.3 to 13.1%).<sup>68</sup> Operative (30-day) mortality is related to myocardial failure, multisystem organ failure, bleeding, respiratory failure in the chronically ill, debilitated individual, diabetes, infection, stroke, and, very rarely, technical problems.<sup>20,40</sup> Mortality is correlated with preoperative functional class, age, and preexisting coronary artery disease.<sup>125</sup>

Published results on mitral valve surgery have improved in recent years, 126 probably because of preservation of papillary muscles, preventing midventricular rupture, 111,112 and preservation of the normal geometry of the left ventricle, which aids in the maintenance of early postoperative cardiac output. 107,108,127 MVR and coronary artery bypass surgery 20 to 25 years ago had an associated mortality of about 10 to 20%.39,128 This mortality risk also has decreased as myocardial protection has improved with the use of blood cardioplegia and retrograde methods of administration.95,129 Some studies have indicated that the risk of combined MVR-coronary artery bypass grafting is now no greater than that of mitral valve repair with an annuloplasty ring or MVR without coronary artery bypass grafting.<sup>107,130</sup> Other studies have shown significantly increased morbidity and mortality with the addition of coronary artery bypass grafting. 43,131 Figures from the database of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons indicate that both reoperation and emergency operation increase operative mortality<sup>132</sup> (Fig. 42-10).

#### Late Results

#### **FUNCTIONAL IMPROVEMENT**

In more than 90% of patients after MVR, functional class improves to at least class II. A small group of patients remains in class III or IV depending on left ventricular function before surgery or other comorbidities.

#### **SURVIVAL**

The causes of late death in patients after MVR are primarily chronic myocardial dysfunction, thromboemboli and stroke, endocarditis, anticoagulant-related hemorrhage, and coronary artery disease. The extent of left ventricular dysfunction and patient age, particularly if myocardial and coronary diseases are combined, correlate with late mortality. The probability

**FIGURE 42-10** Operative mortality for elective, urgent, emergency, and salvage procedures for primary operations and reoperations for mitral valvular replacements. (Data from Society of Thoracic Surgeons.)

of survival after MVR at 10 years is usually around 50 to 60% (range 42 to 81%)<sup>68</sup> (Table 42-4). Long-term patient survival seems to be similar for patients with biologic and mechanical mitral valves. <sup>133-135</sup> Unlike patients with severe aortic regurgitation or aortic stenosis, arrhythmias seldom cause sudden death in patients after MVR; however, few patients die from thromboembolic stroke owing to chronic atrial fibrillation. The fact that more than 50% of patients after MVR are in chronic atrial fibrillation increases the propensity for thromboembolic stroke despite anticoagulation and for mechanical valve thrombosis if the anticoagulation protocol is altered. In addition, patients with older types of prosthetic valves who receive higher-intensity anticoagulation may develop severe anticoagulant hemorrhage. <sup>136</sup>

In patients with bioprosthetic valves, one of the important determinants of mortality is reoperation secondary to SVD<sup>48,49,68</sup> (Table 42-5). Reoperative MVR mortality has decreased significantly in the last 15 years to under 10%, even in patients who have required multiple mitral valve reoperations. <sup>129</sup> At the Brigham and Women's Hospital, operative mortality was less than 6% for reoperative mitral valve operations from 1990 to 1995. <sup>129</sup> Improved myocardial protection, earlier selection of patients for reoperation, and better perfusion techniques, including frequent femorofemoral bypass to protect the right ventricle during incision and dissection of the heart, are factors contributing to decreased mortality. <sup>107,129,137-139</sup>

#### LATE MORBIDITY

The major morbidity in patients after MVR is structural valve deterioration of a bioprosthetic valve and thromboembolism and anticoagulant hemorrhage with a mechanical prosthesis. Both valve types develop perivalvular leak and infection.

Thromboembolism. Thromboembolism is perhaps the most common complication of both biologic and mechanical mitral prostheses but is more frequent in patients with mechanical valves. Chronic atrial fibrillation and local atrial factors, discussed earlier, increase the risk of thromboembolism

in patients with mitral prostheses. A number of recent studies have summarized the thromboembolic potential of various valves (Table 42-6), and it appears that the better the valve hemodynamics, the lower is the probability of thromboemboli. The incidence of thromboemboli in currently available bileaflet and tilting-disk valves is similar to that in bioprosthetic valves—about 1.5 to 2.0% per patient-year. Thromboembolism in patients with MVR is lower in those with a small left atrium, sinus rhythm, and normal cardiac output. It is much higher in patients with a large left atrium, chronic atrial fibrillation, and the presence of intraatrial clot. 116,140 Thrombosis of a mechanical valve, once a feared complication of tilting-disk valves, 141,142 is now relatively rare unless anticoagulation is stopped for any period of time. Valve thrombosis can be treated with thrombolytic agents if the patient is not in cardiogenic shock but requires surgery if the circulation is inadequate. 143,144

Anticoagulant Hemorrhage. Bleeding related to anticoagulation is seen most commonly in the gastrointestinal, urogenital, and central nervous systems, and usually is proportionate to the INR. The incidence of anticoagulant-related hemorrhage has decreased markedly with hemodynamic improvements in mitral valve prostheses. New valves do not require the intensity of anticoagulation of older prostheses. Patients with streamlined bileaflet or tilting-disk valves require an INR of between 2.5 and 3.5; thus, the incidence of anticoagulant hemorrhage is reduced significantly in the newer, hemodynamically improved prostheses. <sup>145</sup> Table 42-6 lists the incidence of anticoagulant hemorrhage with various bioprostheses and mechanical valves.

#### STRUCTURAL VALVE DEGENERATION

Structural valve degeneration (SVD) is the most important complication of the bioprosthetic valve. The probability of structural failure with currently available porcine valves (Hancock or Carpentier-Edwards) begins to increase 8 years after operation and reaches more than 60% at 15 years. 46,48

y indicates years.

This finite durability is a major impediment to long-term success of these biologic prostheses, even though the failure rate in a patient 70 years of age or older is significantly less than in younger age groups (Table 42-7). SVD presents as MR from leaflet tear, calcific MS owing to calcification of valve leaflets or both. The appearance of a new murmur with new congestive symptoms should prompt a noninvasive investigation of the prosthesis and elective re-replacement if dysfunction is documented. SVD leading to reoperation is the cause for at least two-thirds of the reoperations in patients with bioprostheses. <sup>137,138</sup> The probabilities of SVD at 5, 10, and 15 years of the most commonly used biologic prostheses are shown in Table 42-3. With current quality controls, the incidence of SVD is virtually zero for bileaflet mechanical valves.

#### PROSTHETIC VALVE ENDOCARDITIS

Mitral valve endocarditis is considerably less common than aortic prosthetic valve endocarditis, <sup>146</sup> but when it occurs, it may present as septicemia, malignant burrowing infections, abscess formation, and septic emboli. With better antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of mitral surgery and improved prophylaxis for all patients having dental or other surgical procedures, the incidence of endocarditis has been reduced substantially.

The incidence of prosthetic endocarditis is highest during the initial 6 months after surgery and thereafter declines to a lower but persistent risk.<sup>1</sup> The probability of freedom from this morbid event is shown in Table 42-8 for both mechanical and bioprosthetic valves. Biologic and mechanical valves have a similar incidence of endocarditis, except for the initial months after valve implantation, when mechanical prostheses carry a greater risk of infection.<sup>147</sup>

The diagnosis of prosthetic endocarditis is made by the presence of symptoms, appearance of a new murmur, a septic embolus, or large vegetation on echocardiogram. Blood cultures usually are positive, although a small percentage of patients have culture-negative endocarditis. Echocardiograms may show a rocking motion of the prosthesis and the presence of vegetations. The most frequent organisms are still Streptococcus and Staphylococcus; the latter is usually hospital acquired. Antibiotic therapy depends on the sensitivity of the organisms, but immediate high-dose intravenous therapy must begin as soon as possible. Experience indicates that a number of patients with bioprosthetic valvular endocarditis can be "cured" of low-potency organisms such as Streptococcus. However, it is unlikely that antibiotics alone can sterilize more virulent mitral valve infections, particularly Staphylococcus. These infections usually require urgent and

sometimes emergent surgery because of invasion of the cardiac exoskeleton.

The indications for surgical intervention in mitral valve prosthetic endocarditis are persistent sepsis, organism, congestive failure, perivalvular leak, large vegetations, or systemic infected emboli. 27,28,148 Operative technique is similar to other mitral procedures with respect to anesthesia, monitoring, cardioplegia, left atrial incision, and exposure of the valve. Critical to successful resolution is the complete excision of the prosthetic device and debridement of all infected tissues. Surgical technique is described in a different chapter "Surgical treatment of Mitral Valve Endocarditis." Postoperative care should include at least 6 weeks of appropriate intravenous antibiotics. Hospital mortality is related primarily to ongoing sepsis, multisystem organ failure, or failure to eradicate the local infection and subsequent recurrent perivalvular leak. 149,150 Recurrence of infection depends on the type of organism and the surgeon's ability to remove all areas of infection completely. Recurrence of infection is the single most important long-term complication.

#### MITRAL ANNULAR CALCIFICATION

Calcification of the mitral annulus is a process commonly associated with increased age<sup>151,152</sup> and stress to the mitral valve apparatus. 153,154 Based on routine echocardiographic screening, the Framingham study group reported an incidence of mitral annular calcification of 2.8%<sup>155</sup> among the study population. Calcium deposition is most commonly observed along the posterior mitral annulus but might extend to involve the whole annulus, intervalvular fibrous body, papillary muscles and left ventricle. 154,156 Despite rare direct involvement of valve leaflets, 151 the disease process affects leaflet coaptation, restricts leaflet motion, and prevents contraction of the AV annulus. 156 Severe mitral annular calcification, by itself, is not an indication for mitral valve surgery; however, it confers high operative risks in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery due to increasing risks of developing serious complications (intractable hemorrhage, AV disruption, ventricular rupture). 156 The major challenge valve surgeons face in those operations is ensuring a strong suture line to attach the prosthesis during MVR. Sutures within the calcium deposits would almost always lead to paravalvular leaks or valve dehiscence and extensive debridement

may warrant annular reconstruction hence complicating the procedure further.

Surgical exposure should not be compromised in this situation and access should always be done through a complete median sternotomy. Preoperative and intraoperative echocardiographic imaging maps the calcifications and surgeon preference dictates how to best approach the mitral valve to ensure optimal visualization of the leaflets, annulus and, if needed, the left ventricle. Previously described approaches include standard left atriotomy, 157 transseptal access, 158 and finally through aortic root and dome of left atrium if concomitant AVR is required. 156 Since the disease is limited to the annulus in most cases, adequate debridement can be enough to ensure satisfactory valve replacement. In cases of extensive annular calcifications, patch reconstruction of the annulus may be required. The long-term benefits of annular reconstruction have been extensively studied, proven to be excellent when used by surgeons of adequate expertise and subsequently strongly recommended whenever applicable. 159-161 Despite being technically demanding, this technique ensures a strong suture line and gives the option of annular enlargement to fit a larger valve. Another approach described in 1994 by Nataf and colleagues is the intraatrial insertion of the mitral prosthesis. 162 Patients undergoing this procedure benefit from minimal calcium debridement at the expense of a higher implantation of the valve which may transfer the ventricular pressure into the atrium putting the valve at risk of dehiscence. A more recent and promising technique described by Hussain and colleagues mixed the two above-mentioned techniques. It requires the sandwiching of an annular washer posteriorly from trigone to trigone between the annulus and the sewing ring of the prosthesis. 158 Annular calcium debridement in this technique is limited to minimal amounts enough to fit a

prosthesis of reasonable size. Sutures can be taken through or around the calcium deposits and the washer is subsequently attached to the left atrium with running sutures to ensure adequate seal. Authors argue that the washer technique confers a superior annular support and minimizes the risk of ventricular rupture and paravalvular leak. 158

#### UNCLAMPABLE ASCENDING AORTA

Calcifications in the ascending aorta are a common finding in cardiac surgery patients with varying severity. In the majority of cases, safe sites for cannulation and cross-clamping can still be found and surgeries conducted with adequate cerebral, systemic, and coronary perfusion. Porcelain aorta represents the extreme of the aortic calcification spectrum, where the traditional cross-clamping technique cannot be applied due to the very high risks of embolization and subsequent mortality. 163-166 Affecting 2 to 5% of the overall cardiac surgery patients, porcelain aorta is being increasingly encountered with the increasing elderly population. 167-169

Preoperative screening for porcelain aorta is not routinely done which makes it sometimes an incidental intraoperative finding that warrants a change in the whole surgical approach. There is no current uniformly applicable practice as to how to address the mitral valve. 170-172 Maintaining cerebral and coronary perfusion, while minimizing the risk of embolization, should dictate the best approach and the initial decision as to whether find a way to clamp the aorta or not. The general approach to MVR we adopt in this patient population is schemed in Fig. 42-11. In the absence of a significant aortic valve insufficiency, the preferred approach to an isolated MVR is moderate hypothermia with ventricular fibrillation without any aortic clamp. 173 It will ensure adequate valve exposure and coronary perfusion

with minimal aortic manipulation.<sup>173</sup> It is important to keep perfusion pressure high to maintain the aortic valve closed and prevent air embolism. In patients with aortic insufficiency, many approaches have been described and include endoaortic balloon occlusion,<sup>174,175</sup> hypothermic

abandoned by Zingone and colleagues after publishing disappointing results where the use of this device was associated with a higher than expected incidence of unfavorable events ranging from silent emboli to death. The major drawback was the incomplete occlusion happening frequently and attempts to over inflate the balloon were associated with balloon protrusion. The interventionists should keep in mind that if peripheral access for the balloon is sought, it should be well assessed since diffuse calcification of the femorals iliacs or descending aorta are common findings in patients with porcelain aorta.

The use of a hypothermic low flow bypass has been mostly emphasized in patients with minimal aortic valve insufficiency that worsens upon heart manipulation to obtain adequate mitral valve exposure. <sup>174,176</sup> It usually accompanies the previous technique to ensure the operative field does not get flooded with blood jeopardizing the practicality and diligence of the repair/replacement.

Eventually, replacement of the ascending aorta under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest came to be a preferred technique especially in patients with minimal comorbidities. It was first described in patients with porcelain aorta requiring aortic valve replacement in 1992<sup>168</sup> and with growing expertise, surgeons have extrapolated its applicability to mitral valve surgeries. Despite being a more invasive and radical approach, multiple studies have shown that it can be safely and effectively done. 170-172 It is not risk free and benefits need to be carefully weighed especially in elderly or patients with significant comorbidities, requiring multiple valve surgery or concomitant coronary artery bypass graft. Of specific concern is the cannulation strategy and cerebral perfusion. Arterial cannulation should be done under direct epiaortic guidance in the ascending aorta, common brachiocephalic trunk or axillary artery and the venous cannulation can be done directly into the right atrium or through the femoral vein. Cerebral perfusion can be instituted through antegrade or retrograde blood flow into the brain or not adopted at all while monitoring cerebral oxygenation indeces. 172,176

#### Patient-Prosthesis Mismatch

The concept of patient-prosthesis mismatch is not new, but was first described in relationship to aortic valve replacement by Rahimtoola in 1978. 177 Since his introduction, the deleterious effects of patient-prosthesis mismatch on LV remodeling, function, and early and late survival with aortic valve replacement have been well documented. The notion of mitral valve patient prosthesis mismatch (MVPPM) in the adult was first proposed in a case report in 1981 again by Rahimtoola.<sup>178</sup> Most MVPPM was described in relation to pediatric mitral valve surgery, resulting in re-replacement rates approaching 30%, largely the result of somatic growth versus fixed prosthesis size. Recently, the possibility of such patient prosthesis mismatch in the mitral position has become an area of increased interest among adult cardiac surgeons. At this time, MVPPM has been studied through in vitro pulse generator analysis demonstrating that an index geometric orifice area

less than 1.3 to 1.5 cm²/m² could potentially result in any patient having a high postoperative transprosthetic gradient. Similar studies performed in the clinical arena suggest that an index effective orifice area (IEOA) less than 1.3 to 1.5 cm²/m² as measured by the continuity equation may increase the risk for MVPPM. Using this criterion, Lam and coworkers demonstrated a potential for MVPPM of roughly 32% in a recent series of 884 patients. In this population, patients at elevated risk for MVPPM measured at IEOA 1.0 to 1.25 cm²/m² were at a significantly higher risk for development of postoperative CHF than those with IEOA greater than 1.25 cm²/m². Although a weak association with CHF and pulmonary hypertension was noted, no direct correlation was found between MVPPM and the development of postoperative pulmonary hypertension.

Jamieson and coworkers recently evaluated the potential impact of MVPPM and long-term survival.<sup>179</sup> In contrast to prior reports, this study of nearly 2500 patients refuted the notion that MVPPM had any relation to mortality. Instead predictors of overall mortality included age, New York Heart Association III or IV, competent coronary artery disease, ventricular dysfunction, prosthesis type, body mass index, and preexisting pulmonary hypertension.

Certainly some degree of patient prosthesis mismatch may occur as a result of MVR. The surgeon should be aware of the potential for MVPPM, particularly in the setting of particularly small annulus size in patients resulting in the need for implantation of a small prosthetic device resulting in a high transprosthetic gradient. As such, foreknowledge of the devices specific IEOA may assist allowing the surgeon to choose a device that might minimize MVPPM. Unfortunately, unlike the aortic position, in which aortic root enlargement will allow for valve upsizing, the mitral position cannot be corrected as simply. As a result, in patients with particularly small mitral valve area, some degree of patient prosthesis mismatch may be unavoidable. This phenomenon remains an area of active clinical investigation.

#### Mitral Prosthetic Paravalvular Leak

Paravalvular leaks occur after valve replacement surgeries with an incidence of 7 to 17% in the mitral position and minimal clinical sequelae in the majority of cases. 134,180 It is estimated that only 1 to 5% of those patients develop serious clinical consequences (heart failure, endocarditis, and hemolysis) and require reintervention to modify their outcomes. 181,182 This leak arises whenever there is an incomplete seal between the prosthesis sewing ring and the mitral annulus and it has been associated with risk factors including technical (suturing technique and size and shape of the prosthesis), annular calcification, and infection.<sup>183</sup> Early occurrence of this leak has been linked to the technical risk factors, whereas late occurrence seem to happen as a results of suture dehiscence caused by infectious processes or suturing through annular calcifications.<sup>183</sup> A paravalvular leak should be therefore suspected in any patients with a new onset murmur after valve surgery or symptoms of anemia or heart failure and cardiac echocardiography is needed to confirm the finding of a systolic jet into the left atrium.

Once complications arise, patients should be evaluated for operative or transcatheter closure of the leak. Until few years ago, resternotomy was the only option available where the leak can be repaired through direct resuturing or patching or the whole valve replaced. <sup>184-186</sup> The main drawback of surgical reentry, however, is its association with high rate of procedure failure (12-35%) and mortality (4-13%). <sup>187,188</sup> The underlying disease process is still present in addition to the tissue frailty and the fact that this is a reoperation would drive surgeons away from this procedure especially in the presence of multiple comorbidities. <sup>189</sup> Recently, however, highrisk patients with paravalvular leak were offered an alternative percutaneous option.

Percutaneous paravalvular leak repair is a catheter-based technique during which a closure device is deployed to obliterate and seal the leak area. This procedure is not free of risk and requires advanced technical expertise in catheter-based closure-device implantations. The approach to the mitral valve can be transseptal, transaortic, and/or transapical, and the decision on the approach depends mainly on the location of the leak, the vascular access, the presence of mechanical valves, the presence of paravalvular calcification, and the size and shape of the orifice. 183,190 The optimal goal of this technique is to ensure maximal closure with minimal impingement on the valve leaflets and the challenges include the ability to adequately visualize the leak, estimate its spatial characteristics, and find the device that best suits this type of leak. 183,190-192 Angiography, transesophageal echocardiography, 3D echocardiography, and 3D-4D computed tomography angiography are available for use during this procedure to ensure best estimation of the device geometrics and flow hemodynamics.<sup>183</sup> In the absence of devices specifically designed for this purpose, the Amplatz family of occluder devices, commonly applied for ASD, VSD, and PDA closure, are used off-label. Two disk devices like the Amplatz Vascular plug (AVP II most used in USA and AVP III) are preferred because they hold a lower risk of embolization and are better suited for the commonly encountered geometrics of the leak. 183,192 In certain instances multiple small devices are used to close one single defect. Long-term benefits of this technique have been reported by multiple case series which included also paravalvular aortic leaks as well. These studies reported acceptable successful implantation rates (63 and 91%) as well as favorable short- and midterm outcomes in groups of very high operative risk patients. 191,193,194 Long-term mortality, however, remains very high in this patient population because of the baseline high-risk profile they have.

#### TRANSCATHETER TREATMENT

Introduction of transcatheter valve replacement has reshaped the treatment strategy for aortic valve replacement. In the United States, it is currently approved for aortic stenosis patients with high or prohibitive risk. Transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) has been performed by means of valve-in-valve technique.<sup>195</sup> This technique uses the stent of the previous bioprostheses as an anchor for the transcatheter valve; however, it not yet approved by the FDA. Some series report excellent outcome with improvement in the postprocedural gradient. This technique is commonly performed through transapical approach,<sup>195</sup> but other approaches via transfemoral/transseptal and transjugular are reported.<sup>196</sup>

There are many hurdles for the native TMVR. Currently, native mitral annulus is not rigid enough to hold the transcatheter valve. Also, the varied etiology, the complex anatomy, the difficulty in measuring the size of the valve, the exposure to increased pressure in case of paravalvular leak, the risk of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and the excellent result of mitral valve repair are some of the difficulties that TMVR will face. Nonetheless, the technology will evolve and we may see a new transcatheter valve which will solve all these issues in the near future.
