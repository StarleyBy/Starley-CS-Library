# Mitral Valve Repair: Rheumatic

Javier G. Castillo • David H. Adams

After recovery from an initial episode of rheumatic fever, approximately 60 to 65% of patients will develop heart valve disease (rheumatic heart disease, RHD) and possibly secondary conditions such as atrial fibrillation, endocarditis, and heart failure.¹ Rheumatic heart disease is one of the leading noncommunicable diseases in developing countries with a global prevalence of up to 19.6 million in 2005 and an incidence of 282,000 new cases per year.²

In Western countries, economic and sociopolitical changes together with prophylactic initiatives led by the American Heart Association and the World Heart Federation contributed to eliminate rheumatic fever by the 1980s (current prevalence in the United States is 0.05/1000). Much of the morbidity and mortality due to RHD has been proven to be effectively prevented by secondary prophylaxis including long-acting penicillin, oral anticoagulants, and surgical interventions.<sup>3</sup> However, the costs of prophylaxis continue to burden low-income and middle-income countries as well as certain concentered populations of higher-income countries (demographic shifts due to immigration).<sup>4</sup> In this context, an estimated of up to 468,164 patients die each year from RHD and or its clinical complications. Interestingly, recent

echocardiographic data have shown that the true prevalence of the disease is significantly higher than the current global estimate if we take into consideration subclinical RHD.<sup>5</sup>

Rheumatic heart disease is unarguably the most common cardiovascular disease among individuals aged <25 years worldwide, and has a peak age group of 25 to 35 years (female predominance) in developing countries<sup>6</sup> (Fig. 36-1). Conversely, patients with RHD in industrialized countries are either old (mostly above 50 years of age) or young immigrants. In this setting, the mitral valve is affected in 50% of patients and results in mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis, or both.<sup>7</sup> In younger patients, mitral regurgitation is predominant, but mitral stenosis becomes more prevalent with age and calcification of tissues. Regurgitant mitral valves are edematous with fibrotic thickening, and annular dilatation and anterior leaflet pseudoprolapse are often seen, whereas stenotic mitral valves present with stiff, nonpliable, and severely restricted leaflets, fusion of the subvalvular apparatus and commissures and often annular calcification<sup>8</sup> (Fig. 36-2). Clinical assessment and two-dimensional echocardiography are paramount to detect and assess mitral stenosis, particularly in asymptomatic patients.9

The most common lesions encountered are commissural thickening and fusion, leaflet restriction and retraction, and chordal fusion and retraction.

## PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS

The main consequence of RHD and more particularly rheumatic mitral valve disease (RMVD) is mitral stenosis. <sup>10</sup> This circumstance results in an increase of diastolic gradients across the mitral valve with invariable measurements of the mitral area due to moderate-to-severe commissural fusion. From a hemodynamic standpoint, transvalvular flow and heart rate

are considered to play an important role in the perioperative management of patients with RMVD.<sup>11</sup> Mean mitral gradient increases in parallel with cardiac output (importance of atrial contraction) or with fast heart rates.

Increasing mitral gradients trigger left atrium enlargement due to chronic escalating left atrial pressures. This in turn favors the occurrence of atrial fibrillation leading to annular dilatation and thrombus formation. The logical rise in pulmonary artery pressure leads to pulmonary hypertension and late in the course to right ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular dilatation, secondary tricuspid regurgitation and eventually right ventricular dysfunction (inherent surgical risk). This is important to understand why patients undergoing mitral valve repair often receive adjuvant tricuspid valve repair and a Maze procedure. Finally, it is important to emphasize on the role of rhythm control therapies and central vasodilators during the preoperative period and medical optimization for surgery.

#### SURGICAL CONSIDERATIONS

Although mitral stenosis was the first mitral valve dysfunction treated surgically (Elliot Carr Cutler performed a closed transventricular mitral commissurotomy with a cardiovalvulotome in 1923), nowadays most of the patients with mitral valve stenosis receive a percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty unless the lesions are not amenable to balloon dilatation (or there is a high risk of embolic events), there is concomitant regurgitation, or a previous balloon valvuloplasty has failed. 13 When surgery is indicated, mitral valve repair is always preferred to mitral valve replacement due to lower perioperative mortality rates, 14,15 superior preservation of left ventricular function, 16 lower thromboembolic complications<sup>17</sup> and risk of endocarditis (critical in patients with deficient socio-economic conditions), and greater long-term durability.<sup>18</sup> This is particularly important in young patients. However, although repair rates have been shown to be near a 100% in prolapsing valves or patients with isolated annular dilatation, repair techniques are feasible in only 50 to 75% of patients with RMVD (percentage varies according to age, leaflet dysfunction and degree of calcification). 19,20 This difference is attributable to the vast spectrum of lesion complexity found in patient with RHD and therefore the need for more complex surgical techniques that often cannot guarantee long-term durability. In addition, when deciding about repair versus replacement, the evoluting nature of the rheumatic process, which implies a progressive distortion of the subvalvular apparatus even beyond a successful repair, needs to be part of the equation. In this context, it is crucial to distinguish between the lesions in patients from developing countries (the histological rheumatic process is active) and that of patients from industrialized countries were the process is controlled.

From a strictly technical point of view, several aspects have recently transformed the field of mitral valve repair in patients with RMVD. The first one is introduction of polytetrafluoroethylene neochordoplasty to either replace diseased chords or reinforce leaflet segments which has significantly impacted surgical outcomes.<sup>21</sup> Neochordoplasty has actually replaced many of the subvalvular techniques originally described and promoted by Carpentier such as chordal shortening, chordal transfer, or papillary muscle reposition.<sup>22</sup> Additionally, although leaflet extension is not a new technique,<sup>23</sup> the relatively recent introduction of gluteraldehyde-fixed pericardium has avoided shrinkage, thickening and calcification of the autologous pericardium potentially leading to more durable results.<sup>24</sup>

## Type I Dysfunction

Two mechanisms may lead to type I dysfunction<sup>25</sup> in patients with RHD. The first one is rapid left ventricular dilatation and subsequent mitral annular dilatation due to pancarditis (early stages), which often impacts left ventricular contractility due to an acute inflammatory reaction (myocarditis). The second mechanism is annular dilatation secondary to chronic atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation (very common in patients with RHD) impairs atrial contraction thus increasing left atrial pressures. This in turn results in left atrial dilatation and pure mitral annular dilatation.

## Type II Dysfunction

The most frequent lesions encountered leading to type II dysfunction<sup>25</sup> are true prolapse and pseudoprolapse of the anterior leaflet. In the setting of true prolapse of the anterior leaflet, the leaflet overrides the coaptation plane during systole resulting in mitral regurgitation. Causes of true anterior prolapse in patients with RMVD include elongation or rupture (secondary to an acute inflammatory reaction) of the chordae tendinae or papillary muscles, or secondary rupture caused by bacterial endocarditis (facilitated and exacerbated by a dysfunctional rheumatic valve as occurs in patients with severe underlying degenerative mitral valve disease).

In the setting of anterior leaflet pseudoprolapse, as opposed to true anterior leaflet prolapse, the anterior leaflet does not override the plane of coaptation during systole (minor prolapse of the free edge of A2 due to distention and posterolateral displacement of the paramedical chordae). This lesion is often found in patients with opposing dysfunction, this being a combination of type IIIb dysfunction of the posterior leaflet (restricted motion) and consequent anterior leaflet pseudoprolapse (also known as type IIa/IIIp). In this case, mitral regurgitation is secondary to the lack of coaptation between the anterior and the posterior leaflets, which permits full unfolding of the anterior leaflet (there is no coaptation surface against the posterior leaflet) without overriding the plane of coaptation or annular plane.

## Type III Dysfunction

Type III is the most frequent dysfunction<sup>25</sup> in patients with RMVD. In the early stages of rheumatic valve involvement, mild degrees of leaflet fibrosis (incipient symmetric bileaflet restriction) might create mild mitral regurgitation and very subtle hemodynamic changes. Moreover, mitral regurgitation at this stage might be often aggravated by certain degree of annular dilatation. When the inflammatory process induces a more significant fibrotic reaction both leaflets present greater degrees of restricted motion with important hemodynamic consequences. This circumstance might certainly impede leaflet coaptation in systole leading to severe mitral regurgitation. However, in this setting, the more advanced fibrotic thickening of both leaflets as well as the fusion of both commissures and the subvalvular apparatus also impedes leaflet opening in diastole resulting in mitral stenosis. When restricted motion

mainly affects valve opening during diastole owing to isolated commissural fusion or further rheumatic changes pure mitral stenosis is predominant.

#### MITRAL VALVE REPAIR TECHNIQUES

The use of a prosthetic-ring or prosthetic-band annuloplasty is currently a standard technique in all patients receiving mitral valve repair (obviously pediatric patients are an exception requiring biodegradable or pericardial rings or bands) regardless of the etiology of mitral valve disease.<sup>26</sup> Except in rare cases of pure mitral stenosis (with preserved ventricular function and mild atrial enlargement and therefore no secondary annular deformation), annular dilatation is present in the majority of patients with RMVD and mandate correction with a prosthesis size based on the surface of the anterior leaflet or on the intertrigonal distance (any discrepancy between two sizes should lead the surgeon to choose the larger size always). The use of ring annuloplasty has been shown to reduce the incidence of both mitral and tricuspid regurgitation (and subsequent reoperations) in patients with RMVD. In the setting of pure mitral stenosis with obvious annular dilatation, ring annuloplasty contributes to prevent commissural leaks by providing better surface of coaptation between both leaflets (commissurotomy might result in valve regurgitation in the presence of severe annular dilatation).

#### Commissurotomy

Commissural fibrosis and fusion leading to mitral valve stenosis is by far the most frequent lesion encountered in patients with RMVD. According to the severity of commissural fusion, three categories have been described: Grade I—partial fusion of the commissures with chordal preservation; Grade II—complete fusion of the commissure with preserved delineation between the anterior and the posterior leaflets; and Grade III—complete fusion of the commissures with absence of leaflet delineation and calcium deposition (Fig. 36-2).

Commissural fusion is treated by a commissurotomy (Fig. 36-3). Traction of the anterior leaflet with a nerve hook helps to identify the commissural line that delineates anterior and posterior leaflets. Subsequently, using a #11 blade, an incision is made about 5 mm from the annulus (preservation of tissue equivalent to a commissural leaflet) and extended towards the mitral orifice. The incision is then discontinued about 5 mm from the orifice and the commissural chordae are identified and isolated with a nerve hook. The incision is then carried down to the head of the papillary muscle (leaving chordae on each side of the defect) thus creating a subcommissural orifice (the papillary muscle splitting can be further completed by a fenestration). In cases of severe commissural fusion (where an aggressive commissurotomy and debridement might be required), cases of concomitant excessive annular dilatation, or in the setting of acute bacterial

endocarditis (additional commissural destruction and prolapse), commissural resuspension or reconstruction might be necessary (Fig. 36-4). This is best accomplished with a "magic suture" or commisuroplasty (4-0 polypropylene sutures).

# Leaflet Resuspension (Subvalvular Techniques)

Leaflet mobilization and resuspension is achieved with subvalvular techniques, mainly chordal resection and fenestration. In dramatic cases of excessive fibrosis and fusion of the subvalvular apparatus, splitting of the papillary muscle as well as resection of marginal chords and subsequent replacement (neochordoplasty) are considered valid repair options (Fig. 36-5).

Identification of secondary chordae is critical to achieve leaflet mobilization without inducing leaflet prolapse.

The secondary chordae to be resected should be identified and isolated with a nerve hook. The attachment to the papillary muscle is usually cut first (easier visualization) to subsequently expose the leaflet attachment by gentle traction. In severe cases (rarely amenable to repair), marginal chordae can be also resected as long as there is one marginal chordae every 4 mm to support the free edge of the leaflet. If this axiom is not possible, chordal replacement with polytetrafluoroethylene artificial chordae (neochordoplasty) is required (the use of artificial chordae has displaced classic techniques such as chordal transfer or chordal transposition in advanced disease). Fused marginal chordae contributing to subvalvular obstruction are not resected but fenestrated. Fenestration is usually carried down thus spilling the corresponding papillary muscle.

Finding a healthy chord in the setting of RMVD might be more than challenging, therefore techniques such as chordal

![](_page_5_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 36-5** Subvalvular techniques include resection fo secondary chords (top) and chordal fenestrationm (bottom).

transfer, chordal transposition or the posterior leaflet flip have been abandoned. The alternative is polytetrafluoroethylene neochordoplasty (and variants such as the loop technique or the loop in loop technique), which has been increasingly used in mitral valve repair. A CV-5 double-armed polytetrafluoroethylene suture is passed and looped through the fibrous tip

of the papillary muscle. Next, the two ends of the artificial chord are passed through the leaflet margin (approximately with a 3-mm distance between them) and a two slip knots are tied (Fig. 36-4). After functional adjustment (insufflation of saline test after remodeling annuloplasty to assess the plane of coaptation and chordal height), a minimum of six knots are then completed to secure the new chord.

#### Leaflet Augmentation with a Gluteraldehyde-fixed Autologous Pericardial Patch

Although leaflet augmentation with autologous pericardium was introduced in the 1960s,<sup>23</sup> optimal results were not achieved until the late 1980s due to the introduction of gluteraldehyde fixation. Briefly, a piece of autologous pericardium (approximately 5 cm × 5 cm) is freed from adhesions, unfolded onto cardboard (secured with clips), and immersed in 0.625% buffered gluteraldehyde solution for 10 minutes. Subsequently, the patch is rinsed in saline for 10 to 15 minutes (some authors recommend different baths of 5 minutes each).<sup>27</sup> Fixation prevents shrinkage (stabilizes collagen cross-linkages), reduces tissue antigenicity, and minimizes enzymatic degradation and cell viability (avoidance of calcification and fibrosis).

Leaflet augmentation, most commonly of the posterior leaflet (depending on the type and extent of lesions), is performed to increase leaflet surface area in patients with type IIIa dysfunction and severe leaflet retraction (when mobilization cannot be achieved with subvalvular techniques) or to replace leaflet segments where severe calcification has led to a significant defect after resection that cannot be closed primarily. Before proceeding with leaflet augmentation, pliability of the anterior leaflet is assessed by pushing the anterior leaflet with a pair of forceps; if the leaflet rebounds into position then fibrosis probably precludes repair techniques (Fig. 36-2). The technique starts with placement of traction sutures in order to unfold the leaflet as much as possible (Fig. 36-6). Next, a transverse incision is made about 5 mm from and parallel to the annulus (the extent of the incision depends on the degree of leaflet retraction). All secondary chordae are then resected

**FIGURE 36-6** Posterior leaflet augmentation with a gluteraldehyde-fixed autologous pericardial patch.

to free and resuspend the leaflet. Finally, a semilunar autologous pericardial patch is tailored to the leaflet defect adding a 2-mm margin for suturing. The height of the patch should provide a 15-20-mm posterior leaflet. The patch is then sutured using continuous 4-0 polypropylene sutures. Interlocked bites are used on the leaflet side to prevent a potential purse-string effect. An oversized ring (one size larger) is selected in order to fully accommodate the posterior leaflet.

Pericardial patch augmentation of the anterior leaflet is similar to that of the posterior leaflet with an only particular difference, the leaflet incision might be transverse or vertical (rare occasions) depending on the leaflet morphology. The resulting opening after incision will guide our decision about the size and shape of the corresponding patch.

#### **Decalcification Techniques**

The main goal before proceeding with mitral valve repair in patients with RMVD is ensuring (as much as possible) leaflet mobility and pliability. This is achieved with a multistep repair algorithm that should be tailored to every individual patient. The initial step is to interrogate the commissures and the subvalvular apparatus. Subsequently, if the leaflets are not pliable, decalcification techniques can be applied including leaflet shaving, leaflet peeling or leaflet (cuspal) thinning. The latter should be always performed in leaflet areas amenable to a potential patch augmentation (leaflet thinning may lead to secondary windsock deformity and perforation). Calcified areas can be shaved off the leaflet and the annular hinge to facilitate leaflet excursion. Additionally, the thick fibrotic layer of tissue that accumulates on the atrial surface of the leaflet can be peeled off. Finally, if all these techniques do not compensate for leaflet retraction and scarring, leaflet extension is performed.

#### **OUTCOMES**

Mitral valve replacement has been traditionally considered as the predominant procedure for patients with RMVD,

particularly if we take into account that unfortunately many patients with prolapsing valves (a mitral lesion with a near 100% repair rate) still receive mitral valve replacement.<sup>28</sup> However, relatively recent sophistication in reconstructive techniques has contributed to the expansion of mitral valve repair, and this has had a potential impact on outcomes regardless of disease etiology.<sup>29</sup> The most current series on rheumatic mitral valve repair reported an increment of the repair rate from 42 to 69% (within the same surgical group) in the last decade.<sup>30</sup> This represents a great improvement in comparison with previous series which have reported repair rates around 25% in experienced hands.<sup>31</sup> However, the literature needs to be interpreted with meticulous caution. If one analyzes the study population in every large series, can see that those with lower repair rates include a significant larger percentage of patients with mitral stenosis (more complex lesions of uncertain durability if repaired) and older patients (more likely to have subvalvular fibrosis and calcified lesions)<sup>32</sup> (Table 36-1).

It is well known that repair for RMVD (particularly in the setting of pure or concomitant mitral stenosis) cannot be consistent.<sup>33</sup> Regardless of geographical location and length of follow up, reoperation rates (when adjusted to survival) are higher in patients receiving mitral valve repair mainly due to fibrosis (particularly commissural) and calcification of the subvalvular apparatus and the disease progression.<sup>34</sup> Other authors have reported age and mitral regurgitation at the acute phase as significant factors for repair failure.<sup>35</sup> The estimated failure rate of mitral valve repair in patients with RMVD is 2 to 5% per year (vs 1 to 2% per year in patients with degenerative mitral valve disease).<sup>30,36</sup>

There is scarce data comparing outcomes (particularly late outcomes) after mitral valve repair to those achieved with mitral valve replacement, especially in the adult population. In this context, Shuhaiber et al conducted a systematic meta-analysis of clinical outcomes following surgical correction of mitral valve disease (including RMVD) and demonstrated consistent findings favoring a lower operative mortality in patients receiving mitral valve repair with the one exception of those patients with active RMVD (OR
