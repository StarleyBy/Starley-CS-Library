# Aortic Valve Replacement with a Mechanical Cardiac Valve Prosthesis

Robert W. Emery • Rochus K. Voeller • Robert J. Emery

In 1931, Paul Dudley White stated "There is no treatment for aortic stenosis." Even today the medical therapy of aortic stenosis has not significantly advanced.1 Conversely, patients may tolerate aortic insufficiency for many years, but as the ventricle starts to dilate, a progressive downhill course begins and early operation is warranted.2 Definitive therapy for aortic valve disease was unavailable until the advent of cardiopulmonary bypass. Innovative cardiovascular surgeons then began to develop cardiac valve prostheses. Over the subsequent 60 years,3 the variety of prostheses that have become available for use have expanded greatly. Available aortic valve substitutes include mechanical valve prostheses, stented biologic valve prostheses, stentless biologic valve prostheses, human homograft tissue (both as isolated valve replacement and a combination of a biologic valve utilizing a pulmonary autograft and pulmonary outflow tract replacement with heterograft prostheses (Ross procedure). Most recently, innovative transarterial/apical aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has gained approval in Europe and North America with acceptable intermediate term results.4 Reports of the use of novel sutureless bioprosthetic valves are appearing.<sup>5</sup> This chapter focuses on the use of mechanical valve replacement in the aortic position.

#### **HISTORY**

In 1952, Hufnagel used an aortic valve ball and cage prosthesis heterotopically in the descending thoracic aorta to treat aortic insufficiency.<sup>6</sup> After the advent of cardiopulmonary bypass, initial attempts at aortic valve replacement (AVR) consisted of replacement of the individual aortic cusps with Ivalon gussets or fascialata sewn to the annulus or repair of aortic valve by bicuspidization.<sup>7</sup> When successful, these prostheses often calcified and results were short-lived. Shortly thereafter, surgical pioneers Starr, Braunwald, and Harkin began replacement of the aortic valve in the orthotopic position. First-generation aortic valve prostheses, the ball and cage, became the standard for AVR for over a decade (Fig. 27-1).

Many of these prostheses have remained durable for up to 40 years.<sup>8,9</sup> Multiple modifications ensued including changing the material of the ball from Silastic to Stellite, changes in the shape of the cage, depression of the ball occluder, the addition of cloth coating to the sewing ring and the cage, and changes in the sewing ring itself. These valves, however, required intense anticoagulation.<sup>10</sup> Hemodynamic performance was compromised, as there were three areas of potential outflow obstruction: the annular size of the sewing ring (the effective orifice area of the valve), the distance between the cage and the walls of the ascending aorta (particularly in the small aortic root), and obstruction to outflow by the ball itself distal to the aortic annulus. Flow patterns were also abnormal (Fig. 27-2). These problems led to the development of the next generation of a rtic valve prostheses: the tilting disc valve. Innovators such as Bjork, Hall, Kastor, and Lillehei developed three models of tilting disc prostheses that became the second generation of commonly implanted aortic valve replacement devices between 1968 and 1980. The low-profile

Note the laminar flow with the bileaflet aortic valve as opposed to other clinically available prostheses and the flow similarity between the bileaflet valve and the tissue valve in the lower left corner. Tilting disk valves show directional flow, stasis at the minor flow orifice, and eddy current formation distally. The ball valve demonstrates stasis beyond the ball and eddy current formation around the ball itself. Note that the ball is obstructive to outflow, as is the proximity of the ball cage to the walls of the outflow chamber.

configuration simplified surgical implantation (Fig. 27-3). Problems with the tilting disc valve included stasis and eddy current formation at the minor flow orifice (see Fig. 27-2), and sticking or embolization of the leaflet, the latter leading to discontinuation of the Bjork prosthesis in spite of otherwise good long-term results. The Lillehei-Kastor prosthesis evolved into the Omniscience valve, now discontinued. The Medtronic Hall valve, the third tilting disc prosthesis, is also now discontinued (Fig. 27-4A).

Kalke and Lillehei developed the first rigid bileaflet valve, but it had very limited clinical use. In 1977, the St. Jude Medical (SJM) prosthesis was developed and implanted by Nicoloff and associates (Fig. 27-4C).<sup>3,12,13</sup> Over the following decades, the dramatic step of a bileaflet prosthesis nearly obviated the use of all other kinds of mechanical prosthetic valves in the United States and to a large extent elsewhere. The SJM valve demonstrated low aortic gradients, minimal aortic insufficiency, and low rates of thromboembolism (TE).<sup>12,14</sup> Anticoagulation continued to be necessary but to a lesser extent than with previous design models.<sup>15</sup> Because of the low-profile design and lesser need for orientation, surgical implant was further simplified. Following the introduction of the SJM valve, several other third-generation models of bileaflet prostheses were introduced, including the Sulzer CarboMedics valve (Fig. 27-4B), the ATS Medical prosthesis (Fig. 27-4D), and the On-X prosthesis (Fig. 27-4E). Since the introduction

of the bileaflet valve, over 2 million implants on a global basis have been accomplished and extensive literature has developed. Surgeons have become more confident in earlier aortic valve replacement and guidelines for anticoagulation necessary for all mechanical valves have been developed for each generation of prosthesis at progressively decreasing target levels. <sup>15,16</sup>

The lowest profile is that of the bileaflet valve, and orientation of the leaflets is most commonly not necessary, as compared to tilting disc prostheses, for which the major flow orifice should be directed along the greater curvature of the aorta.

FIGURE 27-4F St. Jude Medical Regent valve.

Over the past 25 years, design and configurational changes have been made in bileaflet prostheses. The ATS Medical valve changed the "rabbit ears" pivot style of other bileaflet prostheses, incorporating a convex or open-pivot design allowing more complete washing of the moving parts of the valve and possibly a quieter valve closing. <sup>17,18</sup> The sewing ring of the SJM valve has changed (SJM HP) to allow a larger valve size implantation for any given tissue annulus, as has ATS Medical with its AP design. The sewing ring of the Sulzer CarboMedics valve has been modified such that this valve is implanted in a supravalvular position (top hat model). The On-X valve incorporates advanced pyrolytic carbon technology using a purer, more flexible coating to allow flanging of the inflow portion of the valve housing, better mimicking the normal flow pattern.

The most recent development in bileaflet valve design was the introduction of the SJM Regent valve (Fig. 27-4F). This valve model not only modified the sewing ring, but also redefined the external profile in a nonintrinsic structural portion of the valve, increasing the effective flow orifice area. Thus, a larger prosthesis could be implanted for any given tissue annulus diameter. This was the first mechanical prosthesis to demonstrate left ventricular mass regression across all valve sizes. <sup>19,20</sup> The Regent valve is seated supra-annular with only the pivot guards protruding into the aortic annulus. <sup>21</sup>

In spite of advances in the design and performance of AVR with a mechanical valve prosthesis, the use of mechanical aortic valves has decreased over the last decade. This is due to improvements in the longevity of bioprosthetic aortic valves, the introduction of TAVR, and the theoretical potential of valve-in-valve TAVR for failed bioprosthetic valves. More importantly, however, is the fear of chronic anticoagulation with warfarin by both patient and physician essential over the long term in patients having mechanical aortic valve prostheses.

#### **PATIENT SELECTION**

As with any medical therapy, AVR with a mechanical prosthesis is not indicated for all patients. Several prospective randomized studies have shown no difference in survival in patients having biologic or mechanical valve prostheses or among mechanical prostheses per se.<sup>22-27</sup> However, follow-up was limited to less than 15 years. Conversely, in other nonrandomized studies of patients followed over longer time frames, freedom from all valve-related events and from reoperation were improved in patients with mechanical valve prostheses as compared to patients with biologic prostheses.<sup>11,28</sup>

Most recently several publications have shown improved survival in patients having bileaflet mechanical valve prosthesis, most likely related to improved anticoagulation regimens and longer patient follow-up.<sup>29,30</sup> Importantly quality of life was similar to that of a biologic prosthesis, even in the elderly.<sup>30</sup>

While the advantages of large effective flow orifice and durability with a mechanical valve are paramount, the confounding effects resulting from the necessity for anticoagulation

continue. Patients that are transient, noncompliant, or incapable of managing medications are not good candidates for long-term chronic anticoagulation, nor are those with dangerous lifestyles or hobbies.<sup>31</sup> Patients with higher levels of education, and those from geographic areas with a sophisticated medical infrastructure and a static population have better compliance with necessary medication, anticoagulant monitoring, and those with fewer risk factors for TE are good candidate for AVR with a mechanical valve prosthesis.<sup>32</sup>

Home monitoring of anticoagulation has become an important adjunct in managing international normalized ratios (INRs) in Europe, but is unfortunately lesser used in North America.

A mechanical valve prosthesis is recommended to patients having second valve reoperations regardless of the nature of the first procedure, as re-reoperative risks increase substantially.<sup>33,34</sup> Some studies report low mortality for reoperation of patients with failed biologic valves, but failures can occur abruptly, creating more risk.<sup>35</sup> Reoperative risk is also higher in those patients having combined procedures<sup>33,36</sup> or after prior coronary bypass.

Many surgeons have opted for an age of >70 years as the indication for bioprosthetic AVR, based on data by Akins.<sup>33</sup> In patients younger than 60 years of age, most would opt for a mechanical prosthesis based on prosthesis durability.<sup>37</sup> In the decade between 60 and 70 years of age, other factors have to be taken into account.<sup>38,39</sup>

#### **SURGICAL TECHNIQUES**

Implantation of mechanical valve prostheses has been previously described and is straightforward.<sup>14</sup> Historically, highprofile aortic valve prostheses could be difficult to implant, particularly in small aortic roots. In such cases, a hockey-stick aortotomy is used to "unroll" the aorta and expose the annulus. While the implantation of low-profile bileaflet prostheses is simpler, problems can still arise in the small aortic root. If a tilting disc prosthesis is utilized, orienting the major flow orifice toward the greater curve of the aorta is necessary. Because bileaflet prostheses are the most commonly utilized, the surgical technique for implantation of these devices is described: A midline incision and sternotomy is made and a pericardial well created. Alternatively, a right anterior thoracotomy approach with femoral cannulation may be used. A partial sternotomy is also an alternative in thin patients, creating a sternal "T" at the fourth inter-space.<sup>40</sup>

These alternative techniques are particularly amenable to the implantation of low-profile aortic valve prostheses. The patient is cannulated via the aorta and a single atrial venous cannula. Most commonly, retrograde cardioplegic solution is utilized and a left ventricular vent is placed via the right superior pulmonary vein to maintain a dry operative field. After cross-clamping of the aorta, a transverse aortotomy is made approximately 1 cm above the take off of the right coronary artery, slightly above the level of the sinotubular ridge (Fig. 27-5). The incision is extended three-quarters of the way around the aorta, leaving the posterior one-quarter of

**FIGURE 27-5** A transverse aortotomy has been made above the level of the sinotubular ridge. The diseased valve can readily be visualized and excised in toto.

the aorta intact allowing excellent visualization of the native aortic valve and annulus. The leaflets of the aortic valve are excised to the level of the annulus and the annulus is thoroughly débrided of any calcium. Extensive de-calcification will minimize the risk of paravalvular leak, particularly in newer-generation prostheses with thinner sewing rings, and allows for better seating of the valve prosthesis. Braided 2-0 sutures with pledgets are utilized. Beginning at the noncoronary commissure, the annulus is encircled with interrupted mattress sutures (Fig. 27-6) extending from the aortic to the ventricular surface (everting). Recently, a technique of placing sutures from the ventricle to the aorta has been used to place the prosthesis in a supra-annular position. Alternatively, multiple single interrupted sutures may be placed. After placement, the suture bundles are divided into two equal portions and two individual sutures placed into the sewing ring at the level of the pivot guards, orienting the pivot guard toward the ostia of the left and right coronary artery (Fig. 27-7). Next, each half of the suture bundles are inserted through the sewing ring and the prosthesis seated (Fig. 27-8).

The pivot guard sutures are tied first followed by the sutures beginning at the left coronary cusp extending to the mid-portion of the right coronary cusp. Lastly, the sutures of the noncoronary cusp are secured, seating the valve appropriately. In a small aortic root, should a valve not be able to be seated, paravalvular leak can be prevented if the unseated area of the valve is in the noncoronary cusp. External aortic sutures can be placed from outside the aorta to the valve sewing ring, securing the prosthesis and preventing paravalvular regurgitation. Because of the low-profile nature of the leaflets, opening and closing can still occur unimpeded. Leaflet motion should always be checked and the surgeon must be assured that the coronary arteries are not obstructed. The aortotomy is closed with a double layer of polypropylene suture consisting of

**FIGURE 27-6** The annulus has been encircled with multiple interrupted pledgeted mattress sutures of 2-0 braided suture. The annulus can be readily visualized and all calcification has been extensively débrided.

an underlying mattress suture and a more superficial overand-over suture. The patient is placed in the Trendelenburg position and the heart filled with blood and cardioplegic solution, vented, and the cross-clamp removed. After resuscitation and de-airing of the heart, the procedure is completed and the patient transferred to the intensive care unit. On the first postoperative day the chest tubes are removed if output is less than 125 mL in the previous 8 hours. Following the removal of the chest tube, the patient is begun on subcutaneous heparin (5000 U every 8 hours) or lowmolecular-weight heparin (1 mg per kg twice a day), and warfarin therapy started. Valve implantation can usually be accomplished in under 40 minutes of aortic cross-clamping and with cardiopulmonary bypass times of approximately 1 hour, allowing limited coagulopathic and homeopathic alterations.

**FIGURE 27-7** The pivot guard sutures have been placed aligning the pivot guards with the right and the left coronary artery.

![](_page_5_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 27-8** All sutures have been passed through the sewing ring and the valve is lowered to the aortic annulus and seated appropriately by placing gentle leverage on the valve sewing ring and traction on the suture bundles.

When coronary bypass grafting is indicated, the order of the operation changes. The diseased valve is excised, distal vein or free arterial grafts constructed, the valve is replaced, and the aortotomy closed. Proximal anastomoses are then completed, with one left untied for de-airing. The distal anastomoses of pedicled grafts (internal maxillary artery, IMA) are then completed. De-airing is accomplished through the untied proximal anastomosis.

#### **ANTICOAGULATION**

The durability and function of mechanical valve prostheses, particularly those of the modern generation, is unquestioned.<sup>28,37,40-44</sup> It is the process of anticoagulation that is key and drives long-term success. INR is the standard to which anticoagulation levels should be targeted. 31,45 Anticoagulation is begun slowly following removal of the chest tubes, as the danger of overshooting target INR to dangerous levels is common. 46 Current data on anticoagulant regimens indicate that a one-size-fits-all recipe is inadequate to obtain excellent long-term results. 15,32,47 Horstkotte noted that complications occur during fluctuations in the INR, and less often during steady-state levels, be they high or low.<sup>48</sup> When levels of INR increase, bleeding episodes become more common, and when levels of INR decrease, thromboembolic episodes become more common, both on the slope of the change. These events are opposite ends of the continuum of anticoagulation-related complications. The presence of a mechanical valve prosthesis is also not the only risk factor for TE.32,46

Traditional risk factors for TE listed in Table 27-1 predispose patients to thromboembolic episodes, and as such higher therapeutic INRs are warranted. Similarly, as shown in Table 27-2, nontraditional risk factors for TE will also predispose patients to embolic events. <sup>32,46-49</sup> Butchart has noted that the more of these risk factors patients have, the greater the

- · Increased age

incidence of events and the greater the need for a higher target INR (Fig. 27-9). 19,32 Thus, it is imperative in the modern era that patient risk factors be taken into account and the INR individualized for a given patient. 15,16,47 Recommendations for INR target levels in our practice are shown in Table 27-3. These levels are more liberal than those offered by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines, but more conservative than those recommended by the European self-anticoagulation trials. 50-52 These later reports are especially relevant, because they demonstrate that a lower INR is consistent with a lower incidence of TE if patients are maintained in the therapeutic target range. 50,53 Patients with home testing were maintained in the therapeutic range a substantially greater percentage of the time than those whose status was monitored at anticoagulation clinics.<sup>50,53</sup> Starting self-management early after mechanical valve replacement further reduced valve-related events.46 Puskas et al in a prospective FDA approved randomized trial substantiated theses data and showed that in patients using home INR monitoring between target INR of 1.5 and 2.0 with the addition of low-dose aspirin in these without contraindication. 16 This report documented a significantly lower risk of bleeding without a significant increase in thromboembolic events. In the United States, home testing has not become commonplace or popular. However, home testing can certainly be expected to lower the incidence of valve-related thromboembolic and bleeding events. It has been approved for reimbursement for weekly testing in patients with a mechanical valve prosthesis

or atrial fibrillation, but only after a 3-month waiting period. Obtaining appropriate funding for access in the immediate postoperative period would be an important initiative that could acutely reduce the incidence of valve-related events.

In a report of patients followed over 25 years noted that approximately 40% of the bleeding episodes occurred in the first year following surgery. It is thus important during this initial postoperative time frame when the patient's anticoagulant levels are more likely to fluctuate, that INR be measured more frequently.<sup>37</sup> In the early postoperative period, INR can occasionally jump to supratherapeutic levels and result in significant bleeding events. This is an independent risk factor for mortality at 60 days.<sup>54</sup> Furthermore, the most important independent predictor of reduced survival is anticoagulant variability.<sup>31</sup> We and others therefore recommend in the early postoperative period that one proceed slowly to bring the INR to target levels while the patient is under the protection of subcutaneous enoxaparin (100 IU/kg twice a day) or heparin (5000 U every 8 hours) until the INR is therapeutic. 15,16,37,55,56 Recent data based from emerging genotype technology indicate an improved therapeutic ratio can be obtained using a pharmacogenetic algorithm for initial warfarin dosage required in transition to stable dosage.47

The addition of aspirin to a warfarin regimen can be expected to result in a lower incidence of TE at any given therapeutic INR with a low probability for bleeding events and so is recommended in those without contraindication. <sup>16,57,58</sup>

An educational program to teach patients how to manage their anticoagulation is an important part of the overall operative process. Patients should be instructed on the influence of alcohol and diet on anticoagulant levels, the need for regular dosing, and the potential impact of travel and gastrointestinal illnesses on fluctuations in anticoagulant levels. Warfarin, the world's most commonly used anticoagulant, is well known to be high risk, as is insulin, yet both drugs can be managed with proper compliance and education so that the impact on lifestyle and quality of life is minimal. 10,30,59 Patient age does not appear to be a risk factor for anticoagulation<sup>56,60-62</sup> as long as there are no specific contraindications to anticoagulation due to the importance of regular testing cannot be overstated. The presence of a mechanical valve per se is not a risk factor for long-term neurocognitive dvsfunction.<sup>63</sup>

Newer antithrombin agents may obviate several of the issues discussed above. These agents are showing promise in the treatment of atrial fibrillation, with a lower incidence of embolism and bleeding complications. The drugs are expensive, require multiple administrations per day, and may cause hepatic dysfunction, yet they do not require blood testing or physician visits to maintain the therapeutic effect<sup>64</sup>, Their application to mechanical valve prostheses is as yet unknown. One trial was stopped early due to a high incidence of cerebrovascular events, but trial design has been criticized. More data are necessary.

Notably, platelet activation may be more important in the long-term therapy of an aortic prosthesis than mitral where areas of stasis predominate.<sup>13</sup> This is likely the reason there is no difference in the freedom from embolic events in mechanical verses biologic prosthesis over the long term. 16,28 Thus aortic valve prostheses could in theory be managed with newer strong anti-platelet therapy. Garcia-Rinaldi has tested this theory in 178 patients followed out to 7.8 years treated only with clopidogrel. Results were excellent with few bleeding episodes and minimal thromboembolic events. 65 Importantly, the authors note the majority of patients having thromboembolic events when tested for platelet inhibition were resistant to the drug or had been removed from the drug by themselves or by a physician. They stressed the importance of measurement of platelet responsiveness if only anti-platelet therapy is utilized. 60,65 A prospective randomized trial is warranted to confirm those results.

#### RESULTS

Outcomes from aortic valve replacement with mechanical valve prostheses vary among reports depending on the patient population. Patients with higher risk factors for TE and those with risk factors for anticoagulation will have a higher incidence of valve-related events, making meta-analyses less meaningful. 66 Older patients are at higher risk for valve-related events, particularly thromboembolic episodes, because of the greater number of risk factors that accumulate with aging. The incidence of valve-related events is also determined by the intensity with which the

investigators follow their patients. A higher incidence of early hemorrhagic events may also be diluted over the longer periods of follow-up.<sup>67</sup> Compliance is key to good long-term outcomes. Traditional and nontraditional risk factors for embolism and risk factors for anticoagulation and valverelated events must be considered.<sup>32,46</sup> Several trials have indicated no significant differences in events among various mechanical prostheses, but follow-up was limited.<sup>23,25,27,68</sup> There are, however, certain standards within which one should expect a mechanical valve to perform, and within which the medical decisions for anticoagulation must be made. The majority of valve-related morbidity is related to TE and anticoagulation-related hemorrhage (ARH).<sup>26,29,39</sup> The sections below deal with specific valve-related complications and acceptable current incidence.

Improvements in mechanical valve prostheses and in anticoagulation regimens, along with maintaining and lowering target INR has led to updating of objective performance criteria (OPC) for heart valves.<sup>69</sup> Current criteria for events for both mechanical and biologic valves have been lowered (Table 27-4). Events including TE and perivalvular leak are similar between mechanical and bioprosthetic valves, but the OPC for hemorrhage and thrombosis is higher in mechanical valves, in spite of being quite low but prosthesis longevity favors mechanical prostheses.<sup>69</sup>

#### Valve Type

Freedom from all valve-related events over the long term is shown in Fig. 27-10. In the early follow-up period, ARH is the most common untoward event for mechanical valve prostheses. Thus, over the first 10 years of follow-up there

is a higher incidence of valve-related events in patients with mechanical prostheses as opposed to those with biologic valves.<sup>28</sup>

However, over the subsequent period of 10 to 20 years, the incidence of biologic valve failure changes this ratio such that the valve-related complications of biologic prostheses become more common than those with mechanical valve prostheses. In a series of aortic reoperations, Potter has noted that the time to biologic valve failure was only 7.6 years. This failure rate will increase over time. Overall, freedom from valve-related events is more strongly influenced by preexisting comorbidities than the presence of a mechanical prosthesis per se. 28,32,37,41

### Anticoagulant-related Hemorrhage

ARH is the most common valve-related event. The more intense the anticoagulation regimen, the higher the incidence of valve-related hemorrhage. Most commonly ARH will occur during fluctuations in INR values especially related to changes in warfarin dosing or medical or drug interactions. 48 The most common site for ARH is the gastrointestinal tract, the second being the central nervous system.<sup>32</sup> ARH also accounts for the highest incidence of patient mortality for valve-related events. Acceptable ARH rates range from 1.0 to 2.5% per patient-year in long-term reports. 11,28,37,41-44 Recent data indicate the OPC for major hemorrhage to be 1.6%.69 The long-term reports dilute the short-term impact, as ARH risks are higher early after valve replacement.<sup>37,44,67</sup> With individualized and home monitored anticoagulant regimens, both related events, TE and ARH, are diminished.<sup>50</sup> Freedom from anticoagulation at 10 and 20 years is 75 to 80% and 65 to 70%, respectively. Importantly, one long-term

study noted that nearly 40% of all ARH that occurred over a 25-year follow-up period occurred during the first year of anticoagulation (Fig. 27-11), indicating that a slow increase to therapeutic levels, coupled with close follow-up during this early period is warranted. 15,37,54,55 Results of the European self-anticoagulation study indicate that a lower INR target is appropriate if home testing is initiated, as a greater time is spent in the therapeutic range. This was recently verified by Puskas et al indicating the value of lowered target INR and the importance of home monitoring of INR. Mortality more commonly occurs in relation to bleeding events than in relation to thromboembolic events. 15,37

#### **Thromboembolism**

Thromboembolic episodes (TE) are the second most common valve-related event and are the major reason that chronic anticoagulation is warranted. Khan and associates reported in a large series of patients that the incidence of thromboembolic events between bioprostheses and mechanical prostheses are the same (Fig. 27-12), but the mechanical valve patients are on warfarin.<sup>28</sup> Wu et al in a meta-analysis confirms that TE rates are similar between aortic mechanical and bioprosthesis as does Puskas.<sup>16,69</sup> Acceptable thromboembolic rates range between 0.8 and 2.3% per patient-year.<sup>11,28,37,41-44,70-71</sup> Approximately one-half of these events are neurologic events, 40% are transient, and 10% peripheral.<sup>37</sup> Freedom from thromboembolic events at 10 and 20 years is approximately 80 to 85% and 65 to 70%, respectively.

TE is a continuous risk factor that is present throughout the life of the mechanical valve prosthesis. As patients age, risk factors for TE increase, so one must be on guard to maintain therapeutic anticoagulant levels. Changes in the target INR may be necessary as individual risks increase.

Interestingly, not all neurologic events classified historically as embolic are indeed embolic. Piper et al reported a study of patients prospectively admitted to a single institution with a neurologic event postmechanical valve replacement and intensively worked up. More than 75% were found

**FIGURE 27-12** Freedom from thromboembolism in patients followed for 20 years. Note that there is no difference in the incidence of thromboembolic events between mechanical and tissue valves.

to have intracerebral hemorrhage as the etiology of the event as opposed to embolism. These data would indicate target anticoagulant levels may be artificially high, that not all neurologic events that appear to be embolic in fact are not<sup>72</sup> and support efforts for lower target INR. <sup>15,16</sup>

#### Valve Thrombosis

Valve thrombosis in the aortic position is an unusual event that most commonly occurs late after valve replacement and is due to inadequate anticoagulation or noncompliance. <sup>73,74</sup> In bileaflet valves, thrombus formation impinging valve function occurs at the pivot guards and in the crevices of the valve. Only one bileaflet design does not have convexities into which the leaflets fit. <sup>75</sup>

In tilting disc valves, thrombus is most common at the minor flow orifice. The incidence of thrombosis is approximately <.3% per patient-year and freedom from valve thrombosis at 20 years is >97%. 11,28,37,41-44 Thromboses is rare in biologic valves but does occur. 69

#### Prosthetic Valve Endocarditis

Prosthetic valve endocarditis is also a rare event in the modern era with prophylactic antibiotics. Approximately 60% of events occur early and are associated with staphylococci. The mortality for this event is high. The remainder appear late (>60 days). Prosthetic valve endocarditis is also a continuous variable, and patients must be cautioned to take prophylactic antibiotics for any invasive procedure. Freedom from endocarditis with mechanical valve prostheses is 97 to 98% at 20 to 25 years.<sup>37,44</sup>

The expected incidence is similar between mechanical and biologic valves .<sup>69</sup> The major reason for re-replacement of mechanical valves is endocarditis as opposed to degeneration of the prosthesis in biologic valves.<sup>35</sup>

#### Paravalvular Leak

Paravalvular leak is an operative complication and is most commonly related to implant technique but occasionally to endocarditis. With annular decalcification and closely placed sutures, these events can be minimized. The Silzone experience showed an increased incidence of paravalvular leak wherein the silver impregnated in the sewing ring not only impeded bacterial growth, but also healing of the annular ring, doubling the accepted rate of this complication.<sup>76</sup> The Silzone-coated sewing ring was removed from the market. There may be an anatomic predisposition to paravalvular leak in the area of the annulus extending from the right and noncoronary commissure, one-third the distance along the right coronary cusp, and two-thirds the distance to the noncoronary cusp, due to intrinsic weakness in this area of the annulus.<sup>77</sup> The acceptable range of paravalvular leak is approximately less than 0.1% per patient-year, with early postoperative occurrence predominating. 34,37,69

#### Structural Failure

Structural failure of bileaflet aortic prostheses due to wear has not been observed or reported in long-term studies totaling more than 50,000 patient-years of follow-up. This indicates the high structural integrity of these modern aortic devices. <sup>28,37,44</sup> In a single study totaling 21,742 patient-years with 94% complete follow-up, there was no structural failure. <sup>55</sup>

#### Freedom from Reoperation

The long-term durability of modern mechanical valve prostheses is excellent, and a valve replacement rate of less than 2% over 25 years (Fig. 27-13) can be expected, and re-reoperation after AVR replacement is even more rare. Subvalvular pannus formation is also rare with aortic bileaflet valves. The most common reasons for prosthetic valve reimplantation are pre- and postoperative endocarditis, paravalvular leak, and valve thrombosis.

#### SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES

#### **Technical Considerations**

While the technique of implanting a mechanical valve prosthesis is very straightforward, special circumstances arise. Because of the large size of the valve housing of the St. Jude Medical Regent valve compared to the tissue annulus, entry into the aorta annulus can sometimes be difficult. Occasionally, patients have the smallest diameter of their aortic root at the sinotubular ridge. While the sizer will pass readily through the aortic annulus, seating the Regent valve itself into the annulus can sometimes be difficult and frustrating. It is important to gently rock the valve back and forth through the sinotubular ridge, tilting the valve circumferentially through the narrowest part. Once the valve is below the level of the sinotubular ridge, it will seat readily in the annulus if sizing has been correct. When tying the valve into the annulus, sutures in the pivot guards and the left and right coronary cusps should be first completed. The last sutures ligated are those of the noncoronary cusp for two reasons. It may seem like the Regent valve will not seat because of the large-sized valve housing; however, with gentle persistence seating can be completed as long as sizing has been correct. The Regent valve sits supra-annular and only the pivot guards lie inside the annulus (Fig. 27-14).

Therefore, one should leave the last sutures to be tied in the mid-part of the noncoronary cusp with the valve oriented so the leaflets are parallel to the ventricular septum.<sup>78</sup> With proper annular decalcification and flexibility of the annulus, we have not seen a Regent valve that has not been able to be seated properly.

Similarly, when using the On-X valve one has to be sure that the flare of the valve inflow is seated properly in the left ventricular outflow tract. Gentle manipulation and patience may be necessary. Walther and colleagues note that exact sizing requires some experience.<sup>24</sup>

**FIGURE 27-14** The St. Jude Medical Regent valve on the right as compared to the St. Jude Medical HP valve on the left. With the Regent valve only the pivot guards insert into the annulus, allowing a larger valve housing for any given tissue annulus diameter.

If an oversized bileaflet valve has been implanted purpose-fully in a small aortic root, a bileaflet valve can be tilted and will still function without coronary obstruction as long as the highest portion of the valve is in the noncoronary cusp. Pledgeted sutures placed from outside the aorta through the sewing ring of the valve can prevent paravalvular leak, and opening and closing can still occur due to the low-profile nature of the prosthetic valve. In our review of nearly 3000 bileaflet aortic valve replacements, no annular enlarging procedures were completed. 55

### Patient-prosthesis Mismatch

Patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM) is a concept first described by Rahimtoola and popularized by Pibarot and Dumesnil.<sup>79,80</sup> Unfortunately, views are varied on the importance of PPM.<sup>81-84</sup> This is due to the fact that virtually all contributions to the literature study mixtures of mechanical and biologic prostheses and varying types of each. In a

25-year follow-up of patients with a single-model mechanical valve prosthesis, no difference was found in overall valverelated mortality for patients who had severe PPM, moderate PPM, or insignificant PPM according the criteria described by Blais and associates.<sup>83</sup> This similarity in long-term survival was sustained whether the effective area was measured by in vitro (internal geometric valve area) or in vivo criteria (echocalculated valve area) as shown in Figs. 27-15 and 27-16. This study also found no difference in valve-related events, including operative mortality, long-term cumulative mortality, ARH, TE, valve thrombosis, paravalvular leak, or diagnosis of congestive heart failure. Follow-up in this study was 94% complete and extended over 13,000 patient-years.85 Therefore, with bileaflet mechanical valve prostheses, PPM does not appear to be an issue. This retrospective study was limited in that it did not address patient age (ie, younger vs older), patient activity, or ventricular function. Thus, it is likely that PPM is important in patients with small biologic prostheses, because as the valve leaflets stiffen, clinically significant aortic stenosis becomes prominent early in the postoperative follow-up period, affecting symptoms and survival in younger and more active patients and in those with depressed ventricular function. If one is, however, concerned about PPM, the indexed effective orifice area can be calculated for any given prosthetic valve and a determination made whether an annular enlarging procedure or a different model prosthesis with a larger effective orifice area is warranted.  $^{86}$  PPM has been minimized by the new-generation Regent valve and is very rare with this prosthesis.  $^{20,55}$ 

#### **Stopping Anticoagulation**

Anticoagulation is recommended in all patients with mechanical valve prostheses. Limited trials have been undertaken with low-risk patients, but only after a several-month course of systemic anticoagulation. An increased incidence of valve thrombosis but with little increase in the incidence of TE has been reported in patients not taking chronic anticoagulation if antiplatelet agents are utilized. 73,87,88 One study found no significant differences in valve-related events in patients on warfarin as compared to antiplatelet therapy alone, but follow-up was limited.89 One prospective study is currently ongoing consisting of a randomized trial of antiplatelet therapy versus warfarin after 3 months of formal anticoagulation, but the results are not yet available. 90 Certainly one can expect that highly selected patients with bileaflet mechanical valve prostheses will do well off warfarin on antiplatelet agents, but this is unproven.<sup>21,91</sup>

In a prospective nonrandomized trial of clopidogrel along after bileaflet aortic valve replacement, Garcia-Rinaldi et al as noted above, found thromboembolic events limited to those patients that had clopidogrel discontinued or were

Numbers at the bottom of the figure represent patients available for follow-up.

nonresponders.<sup>65,90</sup> While such an approach is rational based on deductive reasoning from available data, a prospective randomized trend is required before this approach can be recommended.

When anticoagulation requires reversal electively, as for scheduled surgery, the INR is allowed to slowly drift toward normal over 5 days and the patient is admitted for intravenous heparin therapy 24 hours prior to the procedure.

Anticoagulation is restarted after the procedure with antiplatelet therapy, and subcutaneous heparin with warfarin restarted on postoperative day one. Abrupt reversal of INR in patients who have bleeding episodes may be warranted, but carries increased risk of TE. Fresh frozen plasma will gently reverse INR when necessary, but it is best to avoid the use of vitamin K. Frequent INR checks are warranted.

Following ARH episodes, when feasible, because of the high incidence of recurrent bleeding, anticoagulant therapy is withheld up to 2 weeks, using antiplatelet agents only<sup>88</sup> or until the source of the bleeding has been identified and definitively treated. For those patients in whom anticoagulant therapy cannot be restarted, antiplatelet therapy is warranted, but the patient should be informed of an increased incidence of TE to approximately 4% per patient-year and that of valve thrombosis to 2% per patient-year with bileaflet valves.<sup>73,87,88,92</sup>

## Mechanical Valve Replacement in the Younger Patient

A major deterrent to mechanical valve replacement in the younger patient is the impact of long-term anticoagulation. Mechanical valves are, however, more ideal for younger patients due to their excellent durability characteristics. Most importantly, younger patients (ie, patients under the age of 50 years) are a low-risk subset for valve-related events. These individuals have very few risk factors for TE, and thus anticoagulation can be run at the lower end of the therapeutic target range, decreasing the incidence of ARH without altering the incidence of TE. In fact, many infants and children have been managed with only aspirin with quite good long-term results.<sup>93</sup> While this is not recommended in patients older than infancy, it is a feasible alternative. A recent study in patients under 50 years of age followed 254 patients for up to 20 years and found an exceedingly low rate of valve-related events (Table 27-5), an exceptional long-term overall survival of nearly 88%, and event-free survival probability of 92% at 19 years.94

Chiang et al published a propensity-based analysis of patients having AVR with a mechanical versus biologic prosthesis ages 50-69 years from the New York State database.<sup>27</sup> They found there was no difference in stroke or survival at up to 15 years. The patients having biologic prosthesis had

a higher rate of reoperation with a 9% operative mortality. No mention is made of morbidity such as postoperative stroke or renal failure. The mortality rate is high compared to available literature.<sup>35</sup> Economic impact during the operative and postoperative period are also not addressed. The incidence and timing of reoperation may also be underestimated as estimates of up to one third of patients with failed bioprostheses have substantive contraindications to reoperative surgery and thus are not included in statistics for replacement of a degenerated valve. The reoperative mortality is thus be artificially low. Patients with mechanical prostheses had a significantly higher rate of ARH, but higher target INR was used compared to current recommendations. 15,16 Home anticoagulant monitoring was not utilized. Both of these factors would lower ARH incidence. The data are thus not definitive for recommending bioprosthesis for patients in this younger age group. Individual preferences and thorough discussion are thus warranted.

A further reason for implanting bioprosetheses in younger patients is the feasibility and recent successes with TAVR valve-in-valve. 95,96 The experience is limited, however, and this reasoning may offer false hope as valve-in valve procedures are not effective in smaller bioprosthetic valves. 97,98

The longest surviving patient in a series of bileaflet valve replacement patients is currently over 30 years from his procedure, which was completed in his early forties and has been without complication. The low incidence of valve-related complications in younger patients should drive a discussion of the alternative prostheses available for such individuals, especially with new aggressive and reversible antiplatelet drugs. Operative mortality increases with each succeeding procedure; therefore discussion of durability with patients becomes mandatory.<sup>33-35</sup> As anticoagulant regimens become further refined the incidence of ARH will be lowered, making the use of mechanical aortic valves safer.

#### Follow-up

With the use of any valve prosthesis, long-term follow-up is a key factor. Ten years is certainly not long enough to ascertain the true durability of a biologic prosthesis. Grunkemeier reviewed several types of biologic prostheses and found that the 10-year durability was excellent, but between 12 and 18 years durability fell off and prosthetic replacement was necessary.<sup>70</sup> These data were echoed by Khan and colleagues and Chiang et al.<sup>27,28</sup> Valve-related failure of all biologic alternatives including stented prosthetic replacements, stentless prostheses, and homograft and autograft replacements have all shown long-term durability to be less than that of modern mechanical valve prostheses.

Even with some mechanical valve prostheses, durability after 10 years has not been adequate. In recommending mechanical valve replacement, one should be assured to have clinically available data on the prostheses that extend beyond 15 years, which is now available.

In conclusion, with proper selection of patients for mechanical valve replacement, one can expect excellent long-term results, long-term survival, and a low incidence of valve-related complications. Possible indications for recommending aortic valve replacement with mechanical prostheses are shown in Table 27-6.
