# Surgical Treatment of Aortic Valve Endocarditis

Gösta B. Pettersson • Syed T. Hussain

The most common heart valve affected by infective endocarditis (IE) is the aortic valve. Fortunately, significant progress has been made in our understanding and management of aortic valve IE. Clinical manifestations include fever, heart murmur, splenomegaly, embolic events, and bacteremia or fungemia. Early diagnosis is extremely important because progression invariably leads to devastating complications, including acute heart failure, cerebral embolism, and death, if the infection is not treated with antibiotics, surgery, or both. Increasingly, IE has become a "surgical disease," particularly for aortic valve IE, and during the last decade, more than half of all patients have been operated on during the active phase of the disease (early surgery).<sup>1</sup>

## **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Among patients with aortic valve IE, congenitally bicuspid aortic valve is the most common predisposing lesion.<sup>2</sup> Other congenital abnormalities of the aortic valve predisposing to infection are degenerative calcific aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation due to any cause, and rheumatic aortic valve disease. Occasionally, highly virulent microorganisms infect normal aortic valves. Patients with prosthetic heart valves run a constant higher risk of developing IE.

It is difficult to determine the incidence and prevalence of native aortic valve IE in the general population because the disease is continuously changing.<sup>3,4</sup> The annual incidence is estimated to range from 1.7 to 7.0 episodes per 100,000 person-years in North America,<sup>5-7</sup> and patients with prosthetic aortic valves are reported to have an incidence of 0.2 to 1.4 episodes per 100 patient-years.<sup>8-10</sup> Approximately 1.4% of patients undergoing aortic valve replacement develop prosthetic valve IE during the first postoperative year.<sup>11</sup>

The incidence of nosocomial IE is increasing because more patients are undergoing invasive procedures. IE in hemodialysis patients is fortunately relatively infrequent, but when it happens, it is associated with high mortality. Dental procedures, extractions in particular, have been shown to produce bacteremia. However, daily dental flossing can also produce bacteremia in periodontally healthy individuals at a rate comparable

with that caused by dental procedures for which antibiotic prophylaxis is usually given to patients with valve disease to prevent endocarditis, suggesting that prophylaxis may be futile.<sup>13</sup> Endoscopic procedures may also produce bacteremia. Intravenous drug users using nonsterile syringes and needles most often infect their structurally normal tricuspid valves (see "Prophylaxis of Infective Endocarditis" later in this chapter).

## **PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY**

The key to understanding IE is appreciating the pathology progression. 6,14,15 Circulating organisms adhere and attach to areas with endocardial (valve) injury; such damaged areas often have deposition of platelets, fibrin, or clots, facilitating attachment and growth of the organisms. In 1928, Grant and colleagues16 theorized that platelet-fibrin thrombi on the heart valve serve as a nidus for bacteria to adhere, and in 1963, Angrist and Oka<sup>17</sup> introduced the term nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis to describe such sterile vegetations, providing experimental evidence supporting their role in the pathogenesis of endocarditis.<sup>18</sup> As the organism multiplies, it produces matrix material, and this, together with leukocytes and thrombotic material, accumulates in the area and forms verrucous vegetations. Formation of vegetations means formation of a biofilm, allowing the organisms protection from the host's defenses and antibiotics.

The infecting organisms produce and release virulence factors and enzymes that promote organism reproduction and survival and kill and disintegrate host tissue, primarily valve cusps and leaflets. The enzymes produced are organism specific with regard to their tissue specificity and efficiency. When tissue disintegration involves the valve annulus, the infection invades extravascular areas (invasive disease). Invasive disease develops in stages: cellulitis, abscess, abscess cavities, and finally, pseudoaneurysm formation. Invasive disease around the aortic root is generally deeper and more extensive than for any other valve because it is constantly highly pressurized. Internal fistulas, perforations, and heart block constitute specific consequences of invasion. <sup>14</sup> IE of the aortic valve not only causes destruction of the aortic cusps, paravalvular

abscesses, and cardiac fistulas, but is also a source of systemic embolization of vegetation material.<sup>19</sup> Strokes and cerebral infarctions caused by embolism of vegetation material are common. An ischemic infarct may convert into a hemorrhagic infarct. However, when an infarct is hemorrhagic, there is a higher probability of a mycotic aneurysm.<sup>20</sup> Rupture of a mycotic aneurysm may cause devastating cerebral bleeding. Mycotic aneurysms, infarcts, and abscesses in other organs, such as the spleen, liver, kidneys, and limbs, are also common.<sup>18</sup> Aortic valve IE with a large vegetation that prolapses into the left ventricle and comes into contact with the anterior mitral valve leaflet causes secondary involvement of this valve (kissing lesions).<sup>14,21</sup> Such kissing lesions are common and manifest themselves as anterior valve leaflet pseudoaneurysms or perforations (windsock lesions).<sup>14</sup>

Infection of a bioprosthetic valve, porcine or pericardial, may involve the cusps, the sewing ring, or both (Fig. 31-1). Infection of aortic valve allografts and pulmonary autografts resembles that of the native aortic valves: It may begin on the aortic cusps and destroy them, causing aortic regurgitation, or it may start at old suture lines and extend into surrounding structures (Fig. 31-2). Infection of a mechanical heart valve is usually located along the sewing ring (Fig. 31-3). Endocarditis after replacement with a prosthesis frequently causes dehiscence of the prosthesis from the annulus, with consequent development of ventricular-aortic separation.

Heart block with aortic valve IE is caused by destruction of the atrioventricular node and the bundle of His. This happens when the infection invades the right atrium and the triangle of Koch (Fig. 31-2).

## **MICROBIOLOGY**

The microbiology of aortic IE depends on whether the valve is native or prosthetic, and whether the infection is hospital or community acquired. *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Streptococcus* 

*viridans* are the most common organisms responsible for native aortic valve endocarditis. 6,22 *S. aureus* is extremely virulent. *S. viridans* and various other streptococci are not as virulent and cause an infection that often follows a more protracted course. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are also less virulent, but have emerged as an important cause of native valve IE in both the community and health care settings. 6,23

IE caused by Gram-negative bacteria is less common, but these organisms are often resistant to many antibiotics and more difficult to treat and therefore more likely to cause complications. *Haemophilus, Actinobacillus, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella*, and *Kingella* (the HACEK group) are Gram-negative bacilli grouped together because of their characteristic fastidiousness requiring a prolonged incubation period before growth, although bacteriologic diagnostic methods have improved. Fungal IE is rare but extremely serious and very difficult to eradicate and cure. *Candida albicans* and *Aspergillus fumigatus* are the usual agents. Fungal IE is associated with large, sometimes huge, vegetations (Fig. 31-4).

The microbiology of prosthetic aortic valve IE is somewhat different from that of the native valve.<sup>24,25</sup> Prosthetic valve IE is classified as early when it occurs within the first year after surgery and *late* when it occurs after 1 year.<sup>6</sup> Early prosthetic valve IE is likely caused by contamination of the valve by perioperative bacteremia or contamination of the operative field at the time of implantation.<sup>6,11,26,27</sup> This may be particularly true when the infection is caused by coagulasenegative staphylococci and the HACEK group of bacteria. Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis are more common microorganisms responsible for early prosthetic valve IE. 11,27 The sources of late prosthetic valve IE are more difficult to determine. Although streptococci and staphylococci are commonly encountered in these patients, a myriad of microorganisms can cause late prosthetic valve IE.27 Nosocomial infections are often caused by S. aureus or other staphylococci.6

In a small proportion of cases of aortic valve IE, no microorganism can be cultured from either the blood or surgical specimens. This is called "culture-negative endocarditis," but in these cases it is important to rule out fastidious microorganisms, and every effort should be made to identify them. Valve sequencing (universal bacterial, mycobacterial, or fungal polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) is successful in identifying the causative organism in most cases. <sup>28</sup>

## CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND DIAGNOSIS

It is helpful to classify IE as acute and subacute, because there are major differences between these two clinical presentations. Originally, before the availability of antibiotics, these concepts of acute, subacute, and chronic IE also described how long it would take patients to die. Subacute and chronic IE are caused by less virulent microorganisms, such as *S. viridans*, and the clinical course is protracted; antibiotics alone cure most cases if treatment is started before important destruction of the cusps or invasion have occurred. On the other hand, acute IE is frequently caused by a virulent and aggressive organism such as *S. aureus*. The clinical course is acute, and destruction and invasion occur fast, with antibiotics alone often failing to cure the infection.

The onset of subacute IE is usually subtle, with low-grade fever and malaise. Patients think they have the "flu," are often treated with oral antibiotics, and symptoms improve. However, in most cases the symptoms recur a few days after the antibiotics are stopped. In the majority of cases, no extracardiac source of bacteremia is identified. An aortic valve murmur is present in nearly all patients because they have preexisting aortic valve disease. Splenomegaly is common. Clubbing of the fingers and toes may develop in long-standing cases.

Skin and mucous membrane signs occur late in this form of IE. Petechiae appear on any part of the body. Small areas of hemorrhage may be seen in the ocular fundi. Hemorrhages in the nail beds usually have a linear distribution near the distal end, hence the name splinter hemorrhages. Osler nodes are acute, tender, barely palpable nodular lesions in the pulp of the fingers and toes, and bacteria have been cultured from these lesions. Embolization of large vegetation fragments may cause dramatic clinical events such as stroke, acute myocardial infarction, or splenic or hepatic infarcts. Any other organ may also be a target for an embolic event. Destruction of the aortic cusps causes aortic regurgitation and heart failure. The hematologic picture is not distinctive in subacute endocarditis. The leukocyte count is moderately elevated. Anemia without reticulocytosis develops after a few weeks in patients who are untreated. Blood cultures frequently identify the offending microorganism.

Acute IE is defined by a fulminant clinical course. A noncardiac source of bacteremia may often be identified. This form of IE can present with all the symptoms and signs described under subacute IE, but they are more severe and progress rapidly, and patients are often sicker and show signs of sepsis. Early metastatic infections are common. Two physical signs are seen only in acute IE: Janeway lesions (painless red-blue hemorrhagic lesions a few millimeters in diameter found on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet) and Roth spots (an oval pale area surrounded by hemorrhage near the optic disc). In patients with no preexisting aortic valve disease, the presentation is acute. Early extra-aortic infection and cardiac decompensation caused by severe aortic regurgitation is common. Invasion with paravalvular abscesses is also more common, and with invasion behind the central fibrous body, toward the floor of the right atrium and triangle of Koch (Fig. 31-2), the electrocardiogram may show an increased PR interval that within hours or days progresses to

## TABLE 31-1: Modified Duke Criteria for the Diagnosis of Infective Endocarditis

### Major criteria

• Blood culture positive for infective endocarditis

Typical microorganisms consistent with infective endocarditis from two separate blood cultures: Streptococcus viridans, S. bovis, HACEK group, S. aureus, or community-acquired enterococci, in the absence of a primary focus, or Microorganisms consistent with infective endocarditis from a persistently positive blood culture, defined as follows:

- At least two positive cultures of blood drawn >12 hours apart, or
- All of three or a majority of >four separate cultures of blood (with the first and last samples drawn at least 1 hour apart)
- Single positive blood culture for Coxiella burnetii or phase I IgG antibody titer to C. burnetii > 1:800
- Evidence of endocardial involvement:
  - · Echocardiogram positive for infective endocarditis: TEE recommended in patients with prosthetic valves, rated at least as "possible endocarditis" by clinical criteria, or complicated endocarditis, such as endocarditis with paravalvular abscess; TTE as the first test in other patients as follows:
    - · Oscillating intracardiac mass on valve or supporting structures, in the path of regurgitant jets, or on implanted material in the absence of an alternative anatomic explanation

    - New partial dehiscence of prosthetic valve
  - New valvular regurgitation (worsening or changing of preexisting murmur not sufficient)

- Predisposition, predisposing heart condition, or injection drug use
- Vascular phenomena: major arterial emboli, septic pulmonary infarcts, mycotic aneurysm, intracranial hemorrhage, conjunctival hemorrhages, and Janeway lesions
- Immunologic phenomena: glomerulonephritis, Osler nodes, Roth spots, and rheumatoid factor
- · Microbiologic evidence: positive blood culture but does not meet a major criterion as noted above, or serologic evidence of active infection with an organism consistent with infective endocarditis
- Echocardiographic minor criteria eliminated

Definite endocarditis = two major criteria, or one major + three minor criteria, or five minor criteria

Possible endocarditis = one major + one minor, or three minor criteria

HACEK group = Haemophilus, Actinobacillus, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, and Kingella; IE = infective endocarditis; TEE = transesophageal echocardiography; TTE = transthoracic echocardiography

complete heart block. The blood picture is one of acute sepsis. Blood cultures often isolate the infecting agent.

Prosthetic valve IE may present as acute or subacute endocarditis.

Doppler echocardiography is ubiquitous and of fundamental importance in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of patients with IE. 6,29 Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), and multiplane is better than monoplane for diagnosing IE. The sensitivity of TTE ranges from 40 to 63% and that of TEE from 90 to 100%.6 Echocardiography can detect vegetations as small as 1 or 2 mm, but it is more reliable in native than prosthetic valve IE. It is more useful for tissue than for mechanical valves because of the acoustic shadowing of mechanical heart valves. Echocardiography is also highly sensitive for detecting paravalvular abscesses and cardiac fistulas, but may still miss some.

Clinical investigators from Duke University proposed certain criteria for confirming or rejecting the diagnosis of IE. 29 The Duke criteria have been validated, and their limitations discussed by other investigators. 30,31 A modified version of the Duke criteria has been proposed,31 and it is shown in Table 31-1.

## **TREATMENT**

Appropriate antibiotic treatment is the most important aspect of the management of patients with IE. 6,22,27 Timing is important because destruction is progressive, and disintegrated cusps do not heal or regenerate. Once invasive, the infection is less likely to be cured by antibiotics alone.

Antibiotic therapy should be started soon after obtaining at least two blood cultures within a 3- to 6-hour interval taken from different peripheral sites (the modified Duke criteria have as a major criterion "At least two positive blood cultures of blood samples drawn > 12 hours apart; or all of three or a majority of ≥4 separate cultures of blood [with first and last samples drawn at least 1 hour apart]"). The initial choice of antibiotics is based on clinical circumstances and the suspected source of infection. Patients who had recent dental work should receive antibiotics to counteract bacteria from the oral cavity; those who had recent urinary or colonic procedures should be treated with antibiotics that are effective against Gram-negative bacteria. Intravenous drug users are usually infected with S. aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci. Once the microorganism is identified by blood cultures and its sensitivity to specific antibiotics is known, antibiotic therapy is adjusted accordingly.

Higher doses and a combination of two or three antibiotics that potentiate one another are often needed in the treatment of IE. Intravenous antibiotic therapy is continued for 6 weeks. It is difficult to eradicate infection caused by virulent microorganisms with antibiotics alone because these organisms have several mechanisms by which they avoid the patient's defense systems and resist the antibiotics, with the ability to form biofilm perhaps the most important one. Destruction of the aortic valve cusps happens rapidly and causes aortic regurgitation and congestive heart failure. These infections are usually caused by *S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens*, or fungi.

Repeat blood cultures are performed 48 hours after starting to monitor the efficacy of antibiotic therapy. The patient must be watched closely for signs of congestive heart failure, coronary and systemic embolization, and unresponsive infection. Daily electrocardiograms and frequent echocardiograms are performed during the first 2 weeks of treatment. With any evidence of increasing aortic regurgitation, enlarging vegetations, recurrent embolism, paravalvular abscess, heart block, or poor response of clinical symptoms to antibiotics, surgery should be immediately considered. It is better to operate on patients before they develop complications, such as intractable heart failure, cardiogenic or septic shock, heart block, extensive aortic root abscesses, or stroke.

Patients with mobile vegetations larger than 10 mm are more likely to suffer serious complications, including stroke, so early surgery may be justified.<sup>6,7,32-34</sup> Anticoagulation is neither indicated nor effective in preventing embolization of vegetations in native or biologic valve IE; rather, it is associated with an increased risk of neurologic complications.<sup>6</sup>

Current guidelines for indications and timing of surgery in native and prosthetic valve IE are presented in Table 31-2. Surgical treatment should be considered in patients with signs of congestive heart failure, acute valve dysfunction, invasion with paravalvular abscess or cardiac fistulas, recurrent systemic embolization, and persistent sepsis despite adequate antibiotic therapy for more than 4 to 5 days. Approximately half of patients with IE develop severe complications that sooner or later will require an operation. In general, our recommendation is that once a surgical indication is present, surgery should not be delayed. Knowing the sensitivity of the causative organism preoperatively is important to ensure appropriate antibiotic coverage at the time of surgery. Once the patient is covered with an antibiotic to which the organism is susceptible, the penalty for operating during the active infection phase is minimized.

Preoperatively, coronary angiography is recommended in patients age 40 years or older, particularly those with at least one cardiovascular risk factor or a history of coronary artery disease or previous revascularization. Exceptions to this recommendation can happen when there are large aortic vegetations that could be dislodged during catheterization, or when emergency surgery is necessary and angiography is not necessary for planning the operation. For patients with renal dysfunction, clinical judgment should be exercised. Highresolution computed tomography (CT) imaging to diagnose

coronary artery disease may be useful and acceptable in younger patients, but contrast renal toxicity remains an issue.

All patients scheduled to undergo surgery for IE should have a neurologic evaluation and a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain performed preoperatively within a day of the operation to visualize any strokes and to determine if an infarct is ischemic or hemorrhagic. Ischemic strokes are far more common than hemorrhagic, but both are associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Hemorrhagic lesions are associated with a higher probability of mycotic aneurysms, which often require treatment before valve surgery. An angiography is needed to exclude a mycotic aneurysm and should be performed if there is bleeding and a high suspicion. Delay of the heart surgery is usually advised in patients with more serious neurologic complications; we do not operate on unconscious patients or those unable to follow simple commands until they demonstrate neurologic improvement. Patients with ischemic stroke should ideally have surgery delayed by 1 to 2 weeks and those with hemorrhagic stroke by 3 to 4 weeks. <sup>6,7,32</sup> The risk of delaying surgery should always be weighed against patients' hemodynamic condition.<sup>33</sup>

## **SURGICAL TREATMENT**

We routinely perform surgery for aortic valve IE through a median sternotomy; intraoperative TEE is mandatory. Patients who need emergency or urgent surgery are often very sick and may be in congestive heart failure. For this reason, and because they often require complex and long surgical procedures, myocardial protection is of utmost importance. We achieve this by using initial induction with antegrade and retrograde blood cardioplegia, and repeat retrograde cardioplegia every 15 to 20 minutes. The right atrium is routinely opened to cannulate the coronary sinus directly through a purse-string suture around its orifice. We avoid unnecessary cardiac manipulation before arresting the heart.

Another important aspect of surgery for IE is minimizing residual contamination of the surgical field, instruments, drapes, and gloves with vegetations and pus. Instruments used to debride contaminated areas of the heart are discarded before reconstruction begins. In addition, local drapes, suction equipment, and surgical gloves are changed. The objective is to leave as few organisms as possible in the operative field.

The aortic valve is explored through a transverse aortotomy 1 cm or more above the right coronary artery. When the infection is limited to the cusps of the native aortic valve or a prosthetic valve, complete removal of the valve and implantation of a biologic or mechanical valve prosthesis usually resolves the problem. There is no evidence that a bioprosthesis is better than a mechanical valve in patients with active IE. 6,10,32,35 The choice of prosthesis depends on age of the patient, comorbidities, life expectancy, and compliance with anticoagulation. For native valve infection with limited localized infection, an attempt can be made to repair and preserve the valve using autologous pericardium. History of a hemorrhagic stroke is a reason to avoid a mechanical valve and its associated need for anticoagulation.

Class I: Evidence and/or general agreement that a given treatment or procedure is beneficial, useful, effective.

If the infection is invasive beyond the cusps or leaflets, radical resection of all infected tissues and foreign material (prosthesis, pledgets, and sutures) is necessary, followed by reconstruction (Fig. 31-5). 14,25,27,36,37 The pathology and anatomy of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) must be well understood for complete surgical debridement and reconstruction, particularly in patients with prosthetic valve and advanced invasive aortic root IE. To reconstruct the aortic root, an aortic allograft is usually our preferred choice. Use of an allograft is no substitute for radical removal of infected tissue, as not even allografts are immune to reinfection.<sup>37</sup> After

extensive debridement, the LVOT is almost always preserved to allow direct anastomosis to the allograft. The intervalvular fibrosa corresponding to the base of the anterior mitral valve leaflet and the two trigones on either side are the main landmarks to indicate the level of the proximal suture line. The LVOT is sized with Hegar dilators, and an allograft with an internal diameter 2 to 3 mm less than the diameter of the annulus is chosen. The coronary buttons should be well mobilized. No felt is used to support the suture lines. When patching is required, autologous pericardium is our preference, but need for patching should be uncommon! Aortic

Class II: Conflicting evidence and/or divergence of opinion about the usefulness/efficacy of the given treatment or procedure.

root destruction extending into the intervalvular fibrosa or a prosthetic mitral valve is a difficult and not uncommon issue. An alternative technique some prefer when the aortic annulus is involved is patching the defect after resection of the necrotic or inflamed area, before a prosthetic valve is implanted. Use of fresh autologous pericardium to patch small defects (1 or 2 cm wide) and glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine pericardium for larger defects has been suggested. The some surgeons also use polyester fabric to reconstruct the aortic root, and a pulmonary autograft has been used as an alternative to an allograft in young patients. Use of freestyle root replacement for complex destructive aortic valve IE has been reported as well. Al,42 Specimens are divided and sent for microbiologic and pathologic examination and also considered for PCR.

Postoperative complications are common after surgery for active IE. Septic patients may be hypotensive and may have severe coagulopathy and bleed excessively after prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass. When extensive debridement and allograft root reconstruction have been done, important surgical bleeders are controlled before protamine administration. Following protamine, the field is packed and suction is avoided, allowing adequate time (usually 20-30 minutes) for clotting to occur before additional surgical hemostasis is attempted. Antifibrinolytic agents such as aminocaproic acid

may be used in reoperations in addition to platelets, cryoprecipitate, and fresh-frozen plasma in patients with coagulopathy. Radical debridement of invasive disease with periaortic cellulitis and necrotic tissue and abscess may in itself cause heart block, for which a permanent pacemaker will be needed postoperatively. Placement of epicardial leads and implantation of the pacemaker during the operation may be considered. Multisystem organ failure may develop postoperatively. However, rapid reversal of renal dysfunction caused by immune complex glomerulonephritis has been observed. Neurologic deterioration may occur in patients with preexisting cerebral emboli.<sup>33</sup> Pulmonary, splenic, hepatic, and other metastatic abscesses seldom, but occasionally, require surgical treatment. Large metastatic abscesses may have to be drained, and in the case of a splenic abscess, splenectomy should be performed to avoid rupture.<sup>6,38</sup>

## **CLINICAL RESULTS**

The prognosis of aortic valve IE depends largely on when and in what stage the disease is diagnosed, the offending microorganism, and how promptly it is treated.<sup>7,22,43-46</sup> The surgical results depend on many variables, including patient characteristics, timing of surgery,<sup>7,44-46</sup> whether an emergency

procedure is required,<sup>47</sup> virulence of the organism,<sup>43,46,48</sup> whether the affected valve is native or prosthetic, and whether the infection has extended into and beyond the valve annulus. Until recently, patients with prosthetic aortic valve IE had a worse prognosis than patients with native aortic valve IE.<sup>22,27,48</sup> Nosocomial infections are associated with higher mortality than community-acquired infections.<sup>1</sup> The results of surgery for IE have improved significantly over time, but in-hospital mortality remains high. Variations in outcomes probably reflect variations in institution and surgeon experience in treating IE.

Operative mortality for patients with infection limited to the cusps of the aortic valve is largely dependent on the patient's clinical presentation at the time of surgery, age, and comorbidities. Most reports indicate that operative mortality for patients with noninvasive disease is under 10%. <sup>24,27,48</sup> Reported operative mortality is higher for prosthetic valve IE, ranging from 20 to 30%. <sup>22,25,49</sup> Similarly, surgery for aortic root abscess is associated with higher operative mortality. <sup>27,49</sup>

To provide a context for the surgery, the investigators of the International Collaboration on Endocarditis-Prospective Cohort Study (ICE-PCS), an international and multicenter database on patients with confirmed IE maintained at the Duke Clinical Research Institute, recently reported on the clinical presentation, etiology, and outcome of IE with a definite diagnosis according to Duke criteria.<sup>22</sup> The ICE-PCS report included a cohort of 2781 patients whose median age was 57.9 years. The IE was native in 72%, prosthetic in 21%, and pacemaker/ICD related in 7%. Approximately onefourth of the patients had recent health care exposure. The mitral valve was infected in 41.1% and the aortic valve in 37.6%. S. aureus was the offending microorganism in 31.2% of all cases. Stroke was diagnosed in 16.9% and other emboli in 22.6%, congestive heart failure developed 32.2%, and paravalvular abscess occurred in 14%. Surgical treatment was common for the entire cohort (48.2%), and overall in-hospital mortality was 17.7%. Prosthetic valve IE, increasing age, pulmonary edema, S. aureus infection, coagulase-negative staphylococcal infection, mitral valve vegetation, and paravalvular abscess were associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality.

In 2014, we published our current results of surgery for IE in 395 consecutive patients with isolated aortic valve active IE (Fig. 31-6).<sup>24</sup> One hundred sixty-three patients had native

valve IE and 232 prosthetic valve IE. Eight-five percent of the prosthetic valve and 44% of the native valve IE patients had invasive disease, and overall operative mortality was 7%. Survival was similar after surgery for prosthetic and native valve IE. There was also no difference in survival between those with invasive versus noninvasive IE. These excellent results reflect our improved ability to master the surgery for invasive aortic valve IE, as we are able to debride the aortic root extensively without fear and reconstruct it with an allograft.

## PROPHYLAXIS OF INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS

The American Heart Association guidelines for prophylaxis of IE were updated in 2008.<sup>50</sup> Major changes in the updated recommendations include the following: (1) The committee concluded that only an extremely small number of cases of IE might be prevented by antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures, even if such prophylactic therapy was 100% effective. (2) IE prophylaxis for dental procedures is reasonable only for patients with underlying cardiac conditions associated with the highest risk of adverse outcome from IE. (3) For patients with these underlying cardiac conditions, prophylaxis is reasonable for all dental procedures that involve manipulation of gingival tissue or the periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa. (4) Prophylaxis is not recommended based solely on an increased lifetime risk of acquisition of IE. (5) Administration of antibiotics solely to prevent IE is not recommended for patients who undergo a genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract procedure. These changes are intended to define more clearly when IE prophylaxis is or is not recommended and to provide more uniform and consistent global recommendations.

These new recommendations represent a dramatic shift with regard to which patients benefit and who should receive antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of IE. However, they are "guidelines," and physicians caring for patients with organic heart valve disease should advise them according to the perceived risk of IE and potential benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis. With regard to guidelines 2 and 3 above, our recommendation is in support of prophylaxis, and we emphasize to our patients that dental extractions absolutely require prophylaxis. We continue to require "dental clearance" preoperatively for patients scheduled to undergo valve surgery.
