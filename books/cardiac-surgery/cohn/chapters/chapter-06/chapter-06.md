# Computed Tomography of the Adult Cardiac Surgery Patient: Principles and Applications

Andreas A. Giannopoulos • Frank J. Rybicki • Tarang Sheth • Frederick Y. Chen

Advances in computed tomography (CT) technology have revolutionized the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. CT has dramatically reduced, and for some clinical scenarios eliminated, the need for additional testing such as diagnostic arterial catheterization. In the process, CT has become invaluable in cardiac diagnosis and surgical planning.

CT is based on an x-ray source and detector system mounted on the "CT gantry" that rotates around the patient. Major technology advances have enabled CT to image the beating heart, and routine CT at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) has noninvasively excluded coronary artery disease in one heart beat (Fig. 6-1) for over 7 years.¹ However, the role of CT extends far beyond the coronary arteries alone. Using roughly the same CT acquisition strategies, native coronary imaging can be extended to coronary bypass grafts, the beating myocardium, valve motion, the ventricles and ventricular outflow tracks, and cardiac lesions.

In order to understand the clinical contribution of CT and to avoid pitfalls in image interpretation, it is essential for the surgeon to appreciate the basic principles of CT used in cardiac imaging. This chapter is divided into two parts. The first part describes the technical considerations for cardiac CT. By understanding each component, the surgeon will be better able to distinguish image artifacts from pathology. The second part reviews those CT examinations that are most frequently performed in the noninvasive cardiovascular imaging program at BWH, detailing the strengths and limitations of each exam.

### **PART 1. CARDIAC CT PROTOCOLS**

Most advances in cardiac CT, for example in coronary CT angiography (CTA), have focused on the development of protocols consistent with the rapid incremental technology

improvements. One of the major technological advances has been the incorporation of multiple elements into the CT detector system, called Multi-Detector CT (MDCT). MDCT is synonymous with multislice CT. Since all modern scanners have multiple detectors, the semantics can and should be eliminated; this chapter simply uses "CT" to describe the technology.

Data from each of CT detector is used to reconstruct an axial slice perpendicular to the long axis, or z-axis, of the patient. The width of the detectors determines the minimum slice thickness and thus the ability to resolve small anatomic detail (spatial resolution) of the scanner. Thinner slices yield superior spatial resolution; however, comparing two scanners that produce the same number of slices, the scanner with thinner slices will have less z-axis (ie, craniocaudal) coverage per gantry rotation and thus will have a longer scan time. To date, the minimum detector width and largest number of detector rows is 0.5 mm and 320, respectively.<sup>2,3</sup> This yields 16 cm (0.5 mm × 320) z-axis coverage per gantry rotation, and thus the entire heart can be imaged with data acquired over a single R-R interval.

#### **TEMPORAL RESOLUTION**

Successful cardiac imaging by any modality relies on the ability of the hardware to produce motion-free images or, in other words, to image faster than the heart beats. Because it requires that the gantry be rotated around the patient, CT is inherently slower than digital subtraction angiography (DSA) where each frame corresponds to a single projection image. As described below, CT has become faster so that cardiac CT is now being routinely performed.

*Temporal resolution* is the metric that measures imaging speed. For a CT scanner with a single photon source, the temporal resolution is one half of the CT gantry rotation time.

**FIGURE 6-1** Selected coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) image of the proximal left coronary arterial system in a patient scheduled for isolated mitral valve surgery. Using the protocol detailed in this chapter, CT demonstrated normal coronary arteries in this patient, eliminating the need for arterial catheterization.

This is because image reconstruction requires CT data acquired from one half (180°) of a complete gantry rotation. All manufacturers have gantry rotation times on order of 300 ms or less. Using this gantry rotation time as an example, an electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated cardiac image can be reconstructed (using single-segment reconstruction, described below) with CT data acquired over 150 ms of the cardiac cycle. Thus, the reconstructed images inherently display the average of the cardiac motion over the roughly 150 ms during which the data was acquired. This is how ECG gating enables cardiac CT. Without gating, cardiac images are nondiagnostic because the reconstruction "averages" the motion over the entire R-R interval, for example, over 1000 ms for a patient with a heart rate of 60 beats per minute.

There are important strategies to improve temporal resolution. The first uses two independent x-ray CT sources and two independent (64 or greater slice) detector systems built into the CT gantry. The second x-ray source is positioned 90° from the first x-ray source, and the second detection system is positioned 90° from the first detection system. With respect to temporal resolution, the practical consequence of this CT configuration is that 180° of gantry rotation can be achieved in half the time (eg, 75 ms as opposed to 150 ms). This halves the temporal resolution (to 75 ms), and thus for this "dual-source" CT configuration, motion is averaged over only 75 ms. Another strategy uses both X-ray CT source-detector systems to sample the entire heart within a single R-R interval by rapidly moving the patient through the scanner.<sup>5</sup> Both implementations have technical advantages and disadvantages that are beyond the scope of this chapter. However, cardiac imaging in a single heart beat can be achieved using the same heart rate control as noted below.

For single-source scanners, temporal resolution can be improved by adopting a so-called "multisegment" image reconstruction. The difference between single-segment and multisegment reconstruction is that in the former, 180° of data is acquired from a single heart beat, while multisegment reconstruction uses several heart beats to obtain the one half gantry CT data. For example, in a two-segment reconstruction, two heart beats are used to generate a single axial slice, and thus the temporal resolution is halved. Similarly, if four heart beats are used (four-segment reconstruction), only 45° of data are used from each heart beat. This yields a fourfold reduction in the effective temporal resolution, making it theoretically possible to perform high spatial resolution cardiac CT in patients with a rapid (eg, >70 beats per minute) heart rate. However, since multiple heart beats are used to fill the 180° of gantry rotation necessary for the reconstruction, stable periodicity of the heart is essential. When beat-to-beat variations in heart rate occur, image quality is degraded significantly. In our experience, multisegment reconstruction works well in patients with high heart rates who are being studied for clinical indications where the highest image quality may not be required (eg, studies of graft patency or pericardial calcification). For more demanding applications (eg, native coronary CTA) we still routinely employ betablockade for heart rates >60 beats per minute.

# BETA-BLOCKADE FOR HEART RATE CONTROL

As suggested above, beta-blockade is an important component of most coronary-based CT examinations. As the temporal resolution of cardiac CT improves, the dependence on lowering the heart rate will naturally be mitigated. However, the speed of all CT scanners is inferior to coronary catheterization, and thus beta-blockade is recommended for the large majority of patients in whom it is safe. In our experience, many surgical patients have standing orders for beta-blockers as part of their medical therapy, and image quality is excellent. When this is not the case, either oral and/or IV meto-prolol is routinely administered.

#### **ECG GATING**

ECG gating refers to the simultaneous acquisition of both the patient's ECG tracing and CT data. By acquiring both pieces of information, CT images can be reconstructed using only a short temporal segment of the R-R interval. Each segment is named by its "phase" in the cardiac cycle; the common nomenclature is to name the percentage of a specific phase with respect to its position in the R-R interval. For example, reconstruction of 20 (equally spaced) phases would be named as 0%, 5%, 10%, ..., 95%. The period in which the heart has the least motion is usually (but not always) in mid-diastole, near 75%. Thus, the CT exposure (and subsequent patient radiation level) can be lowered by limiting

the exposure to a small part of the R-R interval where coronary motion is expected to be a minimum. This is termed "prospective" ECG gating since the reconstruction phase and width is determined prospectively. The disadvantage of this approach is that cine loops of the entire R-R interval cannot be reconstructed because a complete data set is not acquired throughout the R-R interval. If this is desired, the so-called "retrospective" ECG gating can be used, at the expense of higher radiation levels.

For patients who require imaging of bypass grafts, it is important to note that periodic displacement of both saphenous vein grafts (SVG), radial grafts, and internal mammary artery (IMA) grafts is far less than the motion of the native coronary arteries. Thus, for these vessels, a single reconstruction at mid-diastole is usually sufficient (Fig. 6-2), and prospective ECG gating is routinely used. However, the benefits of lower radiation in this population are relatively moot, since the latent period for a radiation-induced malignancy

is roughly a decade for blood tumors and significantly longer for solid tumors. Patients under consideration for repeat bypass surgery typically have a shorter life expectancy based on cardiac status. Thus, it is *essential* that the surgeon not only recognizes that motion has degraded image quality, but also realizes that additional reconstructions, and even repeat imaging, *can and should* be performed. If the entire course of the graft is not clear to the surgeon at a single cardiac phase, it is almost always the case that another phase will yield motion-free depiction of the graft segment that was poorly seen. Open communication between the radiologist and the surgeon for every case has eliminated this pitfall and ensures that the maximum amount of imaging data is incorporated into presurgical planning.

In cine CT, such as imaging the aortic valve over the entire R-R interval, images are acquired with retrospective ECG gating and subsequently reconstructed throughout the cardiac cycle and then played, in cine mode, to demonstrate function.

**FIGURE 6-3** ECG-gated CT image through the left ventricle and the aortic valve in a patient status post aortic root repair. Note the pacemaker (*right heart wires*); magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was contraindicated. The repair is well visualized and without complication, with only mild aortic valve calcification (cine images showed a tricuspid valve with no significant stenosis). This image also demonstrates a punctate calcified plaque along the superior course of the proximal left main coronary artery, without a significant stenosis.

Each individual image (Fig. 6-3) offers an outstanding assessment of the aortic valve and root structure. Cine CT can also be used to assess ventricular-wall motion. In comparison with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the reference standard for global- and regional-wall motion abnormalities, CT often has inferior temporal resolution. However, it is important to emphasize that cine CT does not require a separate image acquisition. The entire CT data set (coronary, valve, myocardium, and pericardium) is acquired in a single breath hold; cine CT is simply part of the image postprocessing.

For surgical patients, CT has the distinct advantage over MR, in that it is by far the best imaging modality to identify and quantify calcification. Also, the most common contraindications for cardiac CT (eg, impaired renal function as measured by glomerular filtration rate or alternatively by serum creatinine) differ from those for MR (pacemaker), and thus CT can often be used for patients who cannot have MR. As noted above, single heart beat cardiac CT is now a clinical reality, with an entire cardiac acquisition in approximately one second. In addition to the fact that patient radiation is decreased, multiple scans can be performed with the same injection of iodinated contrast material, creating the opportunity for a host of additional studies including myocardial perfusion 6-10 that are, at present, largely in the domain of cardiac MR and nuclear cardiology.

#### PATIENT IRRADIATION

Because ECG gating is required, ascending aorta and cardiac CT delivers more patient irradiation than CT of any other

body part. While details regarding cardiac CT dosimetry are beyond the scope of this chapter, discussions regarding CT dose must be based on sound principles. The radiation risk most commonly quoted relates to the probability that the CT scan will result in the development of a fatal radiationinduced neoplasm.11 Human data for radiation at this low level (the level delivered in ECG-gated cardiac CT) is very sparse; all anecdotal reports support a long latency period as described above. For this reason, patients should be separated into two groups: those with a life expectancy of roughly 10 to 15 years or less, and those with a longer life expectancy. In the former group, the only dose consideration is whether the radiation could cause a skin burn (the only short-term complication of any consequence). X-ray skin burns are extremely uncommon, particularly in CT (even for ECG-gated studies), and typically result from multiple exams repeated at short-term intervals. Thus, for this subset of patients, radiation dose should not be a consideration in determining a modality for cardiac imaging. For those patients for whom radiation is an important consideration, prospective ECG gating should be used. X-ray current modulation is standardly used to lower the radiation dose. The tube current (expressed as the mA) is modulated over the course of the cardiac cycle so that the desired (high) diagnostic current is delivered only in diastole. The patient dose is decreased because the tube current is reduced for the remainder of the cardiac cycle. While current modulation is helpful in many cases (eg, pediatric patients), the decision to use it should be made after consultation between surgeon and radiologist because the potential drawbacks are significant. Most importantly, when current modulation is used, images reconstructed during phases with low tube current are relatively noisy because less tube current is used to generate them.

#### **SCANNING PARAMETERS**

The *scan time* refers to the time required to complete the CT acquisition along the z-axis of the patient. As described above, better temporal resolution decreases the scan time, not only decreasing cardiac motion, but also enabling breath hold CT. This is important in cardiac CT because in comparison to nongated CT, ECG gating not only increases patient radiation but also increases the scan time.

In practical terms, a 64-slice ECG-gated cardiac CT scan (craniocaudal, or z-axis imaging over ~15 cm) can be performed in roughly 10 seconds, versus 20 to 25 seconds with a 16-slice scanner. One great benefit of wide area detector CT is faster (single heart beat) scans. If this option is not available, increasing the thickness of the detectors increases the z-axis coverage per rotation and thus decreases the scan time. For example, in a patient that cannot perform the breath hold, using thicker detectors (eg, 1 mm thickness as opposed to 0.5 mm thickness) will decrease the scan time by providing more z-axis coverage per rotation. However, routinely increasing the width of the detectors for cardiac applications is undesirable since it degrades the *spatial resolution* of the examination. In general, spatial resolution refers to the ability to

differentiate small detail in an image. This is essential component to coronary imaging since the diameter of the proximal coronary arteries are on the order of 3 to 4 mm. Substitution of 0.5 mm reconstructed images with 1 mm images thus impacts the ability to see detail that may be required for accurate diagnoses. Routine consultation between the surgeon and radiologist is essential to best understand and optimize the tradeoff between scan time and slice thickness. For example, imaging of the myocardium and aorta almost never requires submillimeter slices, because the pathology is larger. Thus, for dyspneic patients who require only imaging of the ascending aorta, thicker slices should be used to cut the scan time.

The scanning parameters that primarily determine the number of photons used to create a CT image are termed "mAs," or milliamperes-seconds and "kV," or kilovolts. The former represents the X-ray tube current; the latter refers to the voltage applied within the tube. For the surgeon, choosing the best numbers (typical values are 550 to 700 effective mAs, 120 kV) is far less important than understanding the fact that modern cardiac CT pushes the limits of technology, and thus creates tradeoffs with respect to the x-ray CT source. The source generates photons that are either attenuated by the patient or reach the detectors. When more photons reach the detectors, the image quality is higher because there is less noise. The decision to image with thinner slices (eg, 0.5 mm as opposed to 1 mm) means that fewer photons reach the detector; thus, thinner slices have more noise. This is especially important in obese patients because their increased body mass absorbs more photons than thin patients. For the same effective mAs and kV, images of obese patients can be dramatically degraded by greater image noise.

If there were no limit to the number of photons that an X-ray CT source could produce, the solution would be to simply increase the number of photons (and the radiation dose) until image noise was satisfactory. Unfortunately, because the X-ray CT tube heats excessively when pushed to its maximum, there is a limit to the number of photons that can be produced. This is why image noise becomes problematic with thin slice imaging of obese patients. When this is the case, consultation between the surgeon and radiologist is important because diagnostic images can often be obtained by increasing the image thickness, scanning a smaller z-axis field of view (FOV), or both. The latter can be particularly useful if the examination can be tailored to the most important structure. Scanning a smaller z-axis means that more photons can be generated and used before the X-ray CT tube reaches its heat limit.

On the other hand, whenever possible, the z-axis FOV should be generous, as unexpected pathology can extend in both cranially and caudally. For example, an ECG-gated cardiac and ascending aorta examination to evaluate extension of the intimal flap into the coronary arteries can reveal extension into the great vessels. Also, scanning must allow for variations in the FOV induced by breath holding. As a general rule, for scanning the native coronaries alone, the superior border of the FOV is set at the axial slice corresponding to the top of the carina. This is typically 2 to 3 cm superior to the origin of the left main coronary artery. The inferior border should

scan through the entire inferior wall of the heart and should include several slices of the liver to account for cardiac displacement during breath holding. For bypass graft imaging, the superior border of the FOV must include the subclavian arteries and the origin of both IMAs.

#### **CONTRAST MATERIAL**

Most CT examinations are performed with iodinated contrast material. The exceptions are scans performed solely for the assessment of cardiac and aortic calcification, plus imaging of the aorta and great vessels for aneurysm size measurements alone. Contrast is administered from a peripheral vein, typically with a dual injection system. This injector has two reservoirs to inject contrast followed by saline. For coronary imaging, the contrast and saline delivery are timed so that the left heart, aorta, and coronary arteries are enhanced with contrast while the right heart is filled with saline. The use and the timing of the saline are essential parts of the examinations because artifacts that limit interpretation of the RCA will be induced if the right heart and central veins are densely enhanced with contrast (as opposed to saline).

# PART 2. APPLICATIONS IN CARDIAC SURGICAL PATIENTS

## **CORONARY DISEASE**

# **Native Coronary CTA**

One of the most common clinical indications for cardiac CT is to evaluate the native coronary arteries for stenosis (Figs. 6-4 to 6-7). Numerous validation studies have evaluated cardiac CT for this purpose. 12-25 In these studies, data are typically reported on a per coronary artery segment basis, comparing CTA and DSA. A significant stenosis is generally defined as >50%, determined by quantitative coronary angiography. Data are also analyzed on a per patient basis regarding the value of CTA in ruling-in or excluding CAD. Literature to date reports on patient populations with a relatively high prevalence of CAD (ie, patients already scheduled for DSA). Among the most consistent findings is a very high negative predictive value (NPV) of coronary CTA when performed with 64 or greater detector row scanners. The data and our experience with 320 row scanners suggest a very high NPV, arguing that cardiac CTA can effectively exclude CAD in patients with low to intermediate pretest probability of disease. Furthermore, noncontrast CTA for evaluation of coronary calcium score, an independent predictor of adverse cardiac events and all-cause mortality, is considered to be appropriate for intermediate-risk patients as well as for lowrisk patients with family history of premature CAD.<sup>26-28</sup>

Consequently, CTA has become increasingly useful for the cardiac surgeon in managing patients scheduled for noncoronary cardiac surgery. If the clinical suspicion is low, but not

insignificant, CTA affords the surgeon a method of assessing coronary disease without subjecting the patient to femoral arterial puncture with its known complications. For example, patients undergoing isolated mitral valve surgery for degenerative, myxomatous disease have a low prevalence of CAD, making CTA an ideal alternative to conventional angiography to exclude significant CAD. When the CT protocol described in Part 1 is followed, high-quality imaging is *routine*, and when CTA excludes CAD, surgeons have increased confidence in using CTA alone. Follow-up with DSA can be reserved for those patients who might benefit from catheter-based intervention.

Current guidelines from all major societies support the use of cardiac CT for evaluation of low- to intermediate-risk

patients while also being appropriate even for the high-risk CAD patients.  $^{28\text{-}32}$ 

# CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT CTA—REOPERATIVE SURGERY

Cardiac CT provides the cardiac surgeon with a noninvasive method to assess graft patency after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). Studies using early 16 detector row CT scanners suggest 100% sensitivity and specificity for identifying occluded versus patent grafts, 33-35 with benefits from advanced image postprocessing tools. 36 In similar fashion, 64- and 320-slice CTA have demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy in the evaluation of significant venous or arterial

It is particularly useful for the demonstration of graft patency in patients with a remote

surgical history and unknown graft anatomy prior to DSA, and in patients in whom conventional angiography fails to demonstrate a known graft (Fig. 6-9).

have impacted properative planning of the reoperative cardiac surgery patient.

Patients with recurrent angina after bypass surgery may have developed stenosis or occlusion in bypass grafts, or may have progression of native coronary disease. In these patients, CTA can be more limited. For example, exclusion of significant stenosis in a graft may be problematic due to metallic surgical clips that cause artifact (Fig. 6-10). Moreover, native CAD in these patients is often advanced and heavily calcified. A large volume of calcium may result in an uninterpretable study for many segments of the native coronaries (Fig. 6-11). CTA for plaque assessment in such patients may not be definitive; consequently conventional angiography may be preferred in this population. CTA is increasingly useful for patients with less calcification and less metal artifact.

In the research context, graft patency is an important outcome in the evaluation of different surgical techniques. Randomized controlled trials utilizing conventional angiography for assessment of graft patency typically demonstrate a 10 to 20% rate of noncompliance. This noncompliance is at least partly attributable to the invasive nature of the test. 41-43 Cardiac CT is an attractive, noninvasive, and very accurate method to assess graft patency for clinical trials, again obviating a traditional arterial puncture with its risks and known

complications. Cardiac CT may also be used for routine postoperative control of grafts following implementation of a new surgical technique in a local center practice (Fig. 6-12). However, to our knowledge, there are no published guidelines for appropriate use of cardiac CT in patients status post CABG.

#### REOPERATIVE SURGERY

Reoperative cardiac surgery with live coronary grafts after previous CABG represents one of the most difficult problems in cardiac surgery. Reoperative sternotomy is challenging secondary to adhesions, loss of tissue planes, and the potential for injury to patent grafts, the aorta, and the right ventricle. Injury to a patent left internal thoracic artery graft to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) is associated with a mortality of 50%. 44,45 Cardiac CT has been revolutionary in precisely defining the relationship of important structures (including the aorta, right ventricle, and live grafts) to the midline and sternum for reentry planning (Fig. 6-13). At BWH, every reoperative surgery includes a preoperative CTA with z-axis coverage to include all grafts and the entire course of the IMAs. Preoperative identification of all structures at risk is mandatory, and different, specific operative approaches always remain in consideration.<sup>46</sup> Experience suggests that preoperative cardiac CT will lead to a modification in surgical strategy for 1 in 5 patients undergoing re-do cardiac surgery.<sup>36</sup> For example, if CT demonstrates a patent left internal

Definition of live grafts with respect to their proximal placement of the aorta is instrumental in determining, *before the operation*, the precise manner in which those grafts will be handled. For example, in reoperative surgery for conventional

aortic valve replacement (AVR) in the setting of live grafts, CTA allows the surgeon to plan preoperatively whether or not those grafts will have to be divided in carrying out the aortotomy for the AVR. As described above, CT also allows the cardiac surgeon to preoperatively plan the precise location of the aortotomy itself.

### Minimally Invasive Surgery Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (MIDCAB)

Minimally invasive coronary artery bypass surgery is becoming an alternative to open surgery. With limited intraoperative access for direct visualization, aspects of coronary artery anatomy such as vessel diameter, extent of calcification, and the presence of intramyocardial segments become even more important to define preoperatively (Fig. 6-14). In addition, 3D models that combine visualization of a partially transparent thoracic cage over mediastinal structures allow the surgeon to obtain detailed preoperative understanding of the patient's cardiothoracic anatomy (Fig. 6-15). Preoperative CT has demonstrated usefulness for MIDCAB<sup>47</sup> and totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass surgery, 48 whereas postoperative CT has been utilized for graft patency evaluation in a prospective study.<sup>49</sup> CT is also expected to become invaluable for procedures such as multivessel small thoracotomy coronary revascularization.

Specialized display protocols for 3D volume-rendered images can be used to provide combined visualization of a semi-transparent thoracic cage and underlying cardiac and mediastinal structures. These models can be rotated and viewed from any angle or degree of magnification. With cardiac CT, 3D localization of target vessels, accessibility from proposed incision site, and position of LV apex with respect to chest wall can all be understood preoperatively.

### CARDIAC VALVES

In patients with suspected valve dysfunction based on echocardiography, cine CT from retrospective ECG gating as described in Part 1 provides valuable additional data. As noted earlier, reconstruction is performed for all phases of the cardiac cycle, and the reformatted data can be played in a cine loop. This has relevance in assessment in native, bioprosthetic, and mechanical aortic valves. Recent experience suggests an excellent correlation between planimetric valves areas obtained by CT, MRI and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).<sup>50</sup> Consequently, CT can be used as an alternate modality for evaluation of aortic valve area. This is relevant if trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) is of poor technical quality or discrepant with a clinically expected result. Since patients may be evaluated with CT for concomitant aortic aneurysm or CAD prior to aortic valve surgery, valve area may be obtained from CT with no additional scanning and only a small amount of image postprocessing. CT can be used in correlation with valve area as determined with echocardiography (Fig. 6-16).

Postoperative evaluation of bioprosthetic valves may also be conducted using CT scanning. Although echocardiography determined trans-valvular gradients are the reference standard for determination of "effective" orifice area, CT provides a useful correlative modality—particularly when the echo is technically challenging or discordant with clinical findings. In patients with unexpectedly high gradients post-valve implantation, increasing use of CT will provide more information to guide management (Fig. 6-17). In patients with suspected bioprosthetic valve endocarditis, CT can be an invaluable modality to delineate para-valvular and valvular sequela of the infection (Fig. 6-18).

**FIGURE 6-16** Reformatted CT angiography through the aortic valve shows calcification and stenosis with a valve area of 1.00 cm<sup>2</sup> measured by direct planimetry.

**FIGURE 6-17** Seventy-seven-year-old man with a #23 Medtronic Mosaic valve. The patient developed shortness of breath approximately 1 year following surgery. Echocardiography which demonstrated a peak gradient of 78 mm Hg; the effective orifice area was reported at 0.9 cm². Subsequent cardiac CT showed a normal valve area of 1.7 cm², providing reassurance to both patient and surgeon.

Cardiac CT also permits high-resolution functional evaluation of mechanical aortic valve prostheses without artifact (Fig. 6-19). CT can be readily incorporated to evaluate valve dysfunction, measure opening angles, and to elucidate the underlying cause of valve failure. Figure 6-20 illustrates correlation between CT and surgical specimen in a mechanical aortic valve patient with restricted opening angle and elevated gradients. CT readily made the preoperative diagnosis of pannus in-growth.

# Trascatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR)

Although cardiac CT is traditionally a second line imaging modality for the evaluation of aortic valve disease, it holds a key role in preintervention planning for TAVR. 51,52 Contrast-enhanced CTA is considered by appropriateness criteria guidelines as reference standard for both aortic valve plane planning as well as for supravalvular aorta and iliofemoral system planning. 53 The volumetric data and high spatial resolution afforded by CT makes it ideal for accurate 3D measurements of the aortic annulus, the aortic root, and the ascending aorta; precise measurements of the aortic annulus are particularly important in choosing the appropriate prosthesis size (Fig. 6-21). There is a potential risk that the native valve leaflets will be displaced superiorly during prosthetic valve placement, potentially blocking the coronary artery

**FIGURE 6-18** Patient with clinically suspected bioprosthetic valve endocarditis. Left image shows a pseudoaneurysm originating below the aortic valve ring and exerting mass effect on the adjacent left atrial wall. The right image shows nodular thickening of the aortic valve leaflets consistent with vegetations.

ostia. This risk can be assessed from the CT images by measuring the coronary ostia heights from the leaflet hinge points as well as the leaflet lengths. The optimal fluoroscopic projections, oriented to the aortic valve plane, can also be identified by CT, allowing for improved periprocedural planning.

For TAVR planning, additional CTA images of the abdomen and pelvis enables evaluation of candidate peripheral access vessels, including diameter, distribution of calcification, tortuosity, and angulation. This information is important given the large size of the introducer sheath and delivery catheter used for TAVR.

Although postintervention evaluation of TAVR requires a multidisciplinary imaging approach (MR, TEE, TTE), potential complications can be readily identified with CTA. 54 CT findings correlated with findings from echocardiography allow for excellent assessment of both the postoperative aortic root as well as functional information in patients with paravalvular leak or infection. We note that despite the critical role for CT in TAVR planning, to our knowledge there are no published guidelines for appropriate use of CT for postprocedural TAVR assessment.

#### AORTA AND GREAT VESSELS

Surgery of the aortic root, the ascending aorta, the arch, and the descending aorta is becoming increasingly commonplace as the population ages. CT has been used for many years to assess the thoracic aorta and is considered to be the currently preferred imaging modality.<sup>55</sup> Non-ECG-gated CT is highly accurate in the assessment of the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta since they are not subject to significant cardiac motion. However, ECG-gating cardiac CT adds motion-free imaging of the aortic root, aortic arch, and ascending aorta. Gated cardiac CTA is particularly useful for measuring

the true short-axis diameters of the aorta in assessing aortic aneurysmal growth and decision making regarding intervention. As supported by appropriateness criteria guidelines<sup>56</sup> and without question from a clinical perspective, any surgery involving the aorta (whether the root, the arch, the ascending, or the descending portion) requires preoperative and postoperative CTA for surgical decision-making and follow-up.

# Noncontrast CTA for Cross-Clamping

The superior imaging of ECG-gated CTA better defines the pathology and hence facilitates the preoperative planning. For example, noncontrast CTA is by far the best imaging modality to clearly define aortic calcification. If portions of the aorta are calcified on CTA, then aortic cross clamping and cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass at those sites are contraindicated in order to avoid embolic phenomenon and stroke. Studies have supported the routine use of noncontrast enhanced CTA for identifying ascending aortic calcification and selecting the optimal surgery strategy in patients with aortic stenosis or hemodialysis. <sup>57,58</sup> Preoperative cardiopulmonary bypass strategy and myocardial protection are often critically altered by preoperative CTA. At BWH, the majority of elderly patients increasingly undergo noncontrast CT to assess aortic calcifications.

# Aortic Aneurysm

As with calcification, CT is the most accurate modality to evaluate the aortic root, with both 2D and 3D visualization (Fig. 6-22). Not only can the aortic root be sized from multiple imaging planes, but also the exact location of the aneurysmal pathology with respect to the valve and sinotubular junction can often be defined.<sup>59</sup> This assessment is critical

**FIGURE 6-19** Evaluation of mechanical valve function with cardiac CT. Coronal oblique multiplanar reformatted images (A) demonstrate closed and open positions of mechanical AVR in a patient with suspected valve dysfunction based on echo-Doppler. Axial oblique slab maximum intensity projection images (B) demonstrate closed and open position of mechanical AVR in a patient in atrial fibrillation at the time of cardiac CT. Although image quality is degraded by arrhythmia, optimization of the dataset with ECG-editing can result in diagnostic quality images. Four-chamber oblique multiplanar reformatted images (C) demonstrate closed and open positions of a mechanical MVR. Images can be generated over the cardiac cycle and displayed in a cine movie format to allow dynamic evaluation of valve function. Since the study is performed with contrast, thrombus or perivalvular abscess can also be identified if present.

**FIGURE 6-20** Patient with mechanical aortic valve. Low density material restricting leaflet opening on the undersurface of the valve is suspicious for pannus in-growth causing restricted opening angle (*left*). Photograph of explant (*right*) demonstrates the pannus with high correlation with presurgical imaging.

for preoperative decision-making and surgical planning. In patients with ascending aortic aneurysm, if the aortic root is determined to be aneurysmal near the coronary ostia, surgical decision-making changes from a simple tube graft repair for the aneurysm to a much more complex composite root repair with coronary reimplantation. Three-dimensional volume rendering optimally depicts other aortic root pathologies such as coronary anomalies or a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm (Fig. 6-23). In patients with a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm, as opposed to a root aneurysm, CT alters surgical strategy for repair.

For known ascending aortic aneurysms that do not meet size criteria for surgery, CTA is excellent to periodically assess size or change. For those patients who require surgery, CTA with 3D volume-rendered images provides the surgeon with preoperative visualization of aneurysm size and extent. The extension of an ascending aortic aneurysm into the arch can be demonstrated and, as mentioned above, the expected location of aortic cross-clamping can be determined preoperatively (Fig. 6-24). The location of normal aorta distally and the extent of arch involvement will preoperatively determine the arterial cardiopulmonary bypass cannulation site as well as the need for concomitant arch repair, circulatory arrest, or selective antegrade perfusion. Selective antegrade cerebral perfusion itself is dependent on intact right axillary and innominate arteries, and CTA is optimal for defining this anatomy. Since the success of a procedure can be compromised by unexpected intraoperative

Note the precise definition of the aortic wall, free from the cardiac motion related artifacts that are present at conventional thoracic CT scanning. Aortic root size measurements are highly accurate due to lack of motion artifacts and the high spatial resolution of the cardiac CT scanning (<0.5 mm).

**FIGURE 6-23** Cardiac CT provides optimal visualization of complex aortic root pathology. Prior echocardiogram suggested the entire aortic root to be aneurysmal at greater than 4.5 cm.

The remainder of aortic root is normal.

Sagittal oblique maximum intensity projection image (20 mm thick) can be used to demonstrate aortic size measurements. The aneurysm can be seen to extend into the aortic arch. As the entire ascending aorta and proximal arch needed to be replaced, cross-clamping could not occur proximal to the innominate in this patient and would have to occur in the mid-distal arch altering the surgical risk of the procedure.

findings, CT has contributed enormously to surgical planning by defining anatomy that would not be preoperatively visualized with any other imaging modality.

# Aortic Dissection and Aortic Intramural Hematoma (AIH)

CTA enjoys a sensitivity and specificity of almost 100% for detection of aortic dissection and intramural hematoma,

thus allowing the surgeon to understand the extent of the intimal flap.<sup>56</sup> In particular, ECG-gated CT offers information regarding dissection of the ascending aorta (the proximal extent of the dissection flap and its relationship to the coronary arteries and the aortic valve) that was not available before gating was routinely performed. In addition, motion-free images obtained with ECG gating allow for definitive exclusion of type A dissection (Fig. 6-25). The location of the true and false lumen is critical in the preoperative planning,

![](_page_17_Figure_6.jpeg)

**FIGURE 6-25** Although multiple modalities may be used for evaluation of the aortic root, cardiac CT is the gold standard for all pathology of the aorta, including the exclusion and characterization of type A dissection. Parasternal long-axis image from trans-thoracic echocardiogram (A) demonstrates a linear area of echogenicity (*white arrow*) above the noncoronary cusp of the aortic valve concerning for an intimal flap. The finding was detected incidentally in a patient with recent stroke and possible PFO. Subsequent trans-esophageal echocardiogram (B) again demonstrated the finding. Axial image from cardiac CT scan (C) provides excellent visualization of the aortic root and definitively excludes the present of an intimal flap. Sagittal oblique maximum intensity projection image (D) demonstrates aortic root and ascending aorta to be normal. No further evaluation is needed. Echocardiographic findings were presumed to be from artifact.

the operative sequence, and the extent of repair. For example, in dissection of the descending aorta, end-organ perfusion is assessed by demonstrating contrast enhancement of individual organs and related compromise of the celiac, superior mesenteric, inferior mesenteric or renal arteries. As is the case for a nonsurgical aneurysm, if a descending thoracic aortic dissection is stable and to be followed expectantly, CTA remains the reference standard for periodic assessment. Emergency nonenhanced CT, followed by CT contrast-enhanced angiography is the guideline endorsed recommendation, on particular when IMH or aortic dissection are suspected. Contrast-enhanced CTA is the appropriate, definitive test in patients with suspicion of aortic dissection.

## Traumatic Aortic Injury

For patients with suspected trauma of the aorta and the great vessels contrast-enhanced CT is the guideline-endorsed<sup>60,62</sup> reference standard. Almost all polytrauma diagnostic algorithms include a combination of chest radiography plus CTA for initial patient evaluation. The sensitivity and specificity of CT are close to 100% and it is the only imaging modality that has NPV of 100%.<sup>63,64</sup>

Aside direct visualization of traumatic aortic injury, CT allows for simultaneous imaging of indirect signs including widened mediastinum, pulmonary contusion, left scapula fracture, hemothorax, and pseudoaneurysm of the aortic wall (Fig. 6-26).<sup>65</sup>

## **Pulmonary Embolism**

Growing evidence from recent studies and known societies guidelines<sup>66,67</sup> support CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) as the first-line imaging test to confirm or exclude the clinical suspicion of acute pulmonary embolism (PE).<sup>68</sup> Combined with careful clinical assessment and specific biomarkers (D-Dimers, NT-pro-BNP, Troponin I), CTPA can further guide management in patients of low to moderate risk. Right ventricular dysfunction as demonstrated by an enlarged RV diameter,<sup>69,70</sup> abnormal position of interventricular septum and inferior vena cava contrast reflux, provides aside to diagnostic assistance, prognostic value and may predict adverse outcomes and patient mortality (Fig. 6-27).<sup>71</sup>

#### **HEART FAILURE**

Heart transplantation is the definitive therapy for end-stage heart failure whereas left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) represent a bridge to transplantation, a destination therapy, or a bridge to recovery. Complications can appear either acutely or gradually. Aside providing important anatomical information preoperationally, CT can be utilized for the assessment of proper device function and the early identification of complications. Since this patient population often has impaired renal function, iodinated contrast-induced nephrotoxicity is an important risk that should be carefully considered in discussion between the surgeon and radiologist. Scans

can sometimes be performed with a reduced iodine load with satisfactory image quality.

# Implantable Devices for Heart Failure

For patients with implantable cardiac devices, ECG-gated cardiac CT is feasible, accurate, and enhances the diagnostic evaluation of suspected LVAD dysfunction, further modifying management.<sup>74,75</sup>

For LVAD assessment, CT is superior to echocardiography that has limited imaging depth and coverage volume with regards to the limited acoustic window and acoustic shadowing. Common complications such as in-device-thrombus formation, hemorrhage, cannula/driveline obstruction, pericardium tamponade, or infections can be recognized; the

Note the enlargement of the main pulmonary artery and (B) relative enlargement of the RV (\*) with respect to the LV. This finding strongly suggests right heart strain.

orientation of the device can be assessed using multiplanar reformatted images (Fig. 6-28).<sup>77</sup>

The diagnosis of tamponade in patients with LAVD almost entirely relies on CT, and common findings include inferior vena cava dilatation, right ventricle compression, and contrast material reflux into the azygos vein. 77 Peridevice presence of gas or fluid accumulation are indicative of infections, and given the contraindication of MR, cardiac CT is considered to be the test of choice to evaluate for mycotic pseudoaneurysm. 78 CT is recommended by guidelines 79 for visualization of the native heart and LVAD components and may be valuable when other imaging modalities have not been revealing.

(A) Axial image demonstrates a fluid attenuation lesion containing a punctate amount of gas (*arrow*) at the level of the ventricular insertion. (B) Reformatted image shows the orientation of the ventricular insertion pointed superiorly to the long axis of the left ventricle with impingement on the anterior heart.

In patients with implantable pacemakers and defibrillators, ECG-gated CT with multiplanar reformatting is useful for identifying late (>1 month postimplantation) lead malposition, and in conjunction with echocardiography findings can evaluate possible cardiac perforation.<sup>80</sup>

# **Heart Transplantation**

The role of cardiac CT is secondary for the diagnosis of acute transplantation complications, namely acute cardiac allograft rejection, as echocardiography and MR are used as the firstline imaging modalities.81 Coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) affects almost half of the transplant recipients and represents one of the major mortality causes. CTA offers a reliable diagnostic tool alternative to the traditionally used interventional coronary angiography (ICA) and intravascular ultrasound. By offering an excellent NPV in relation to reference ICA, CT can be utilized as a noninvasive approach, thereby minimizing invasive procedures. 82, 83 Important limitation is the inability to adequately visualize distal coronary vasculature with a diameter of <1.5 mm where early CAV is usually recognized. Cardiac CT can exclude significant CAV within the larger, major coronary segments that may be suitable for stenting.84

### **VARIOUS**

## Imaging of the Pericardium

In patients with clinically suspected constrictive pericarditis, cardiac MR or CT can be used to confirm and measure pericardial thickening. In comparison with MR, CT far better demonstrates the presence and extent of calcification as well as the localization and characterization of pericardial effusion, cysts, or masses. This may be of value in confirming chronic calcific pericardial thickening, supporting the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis (Fig. 6-29). In these cases, 3D volume rendering illustrates regional localization and distribution of pericardial abnormality; CT is an outstanding preoperative planning tool prior to pericardial stripping (Fig. 6-30). Furthermore, retrospectively ECG-gated studies can guide functional evaluation of septal bounce or pericardial tethering. 85

Primary or metastatic pericardial masses are rare. CT and MRI offer additional information on the localization and sizing, detection of calcification, and tissue characterizations (presence of blood, thrombus, or fat). Usual image findings include contrast enhancement and high-signal intensity T2W images in CT and MR, respectively. Uncommon lesions such as pericardium cysts and diverticula have typical appearance on CT as well-circumscribed, thin-walled fluid collection most frequently found in the right cardiophrenic angle.

### Cardiac Masses

Cardiac MRI is the preferred modality for high spatial resolution cross-sectional imaging to evaluate cardiac and

pericardial masses. However, CT may be desired, and potentially required, if the mass is known to extend into the mediastinum, chest wall, or lung, or if the patient has a contraindication to MRI. CT also evaluates extra-cardiac thoracic structures with high spatial resolution; thus, it can define the full extent of disease (Fig. 6-31). CT is also useful as a single follow-up examination in patients with metastases to the heart and lungs because it avoids the need for periodic assessment with both conventional chest CT and cardiac MRI. Fat-containing lesions are very amenable to evaluation by CT, since these low attenuation lesions have a characteristic appearance, appearing black relative to water (Fig. 6-32).

### **Cardiac Infections**

Infective endocarditis (IE) may involve native or prosthetic cardiac valves. The diagnosis is typically suggested on clinical assessment. However, imaging confirms the clinical suspicion and demonstrates cardiac valve vegetations, paravalvular abscesses, complications, and further identifying and grading heart failure. ECG-gated CT in IE may be appropriate by guidelines, <sup>86,87</sup> depending on the clinical presentation, and is complimentary to echocardiography (TTE and TEE) for the evaluation of suspected paravalvular and myocardial abscesses, pseudoaneurysms and infections of prosthetic heart valves (Fig. 6-33). CTA may be appropriate, again depending on the clinical scenario, for identifying the coronary arteries origin prior to surgery.<sup>87</sup> Vegetations smaller than 1 cm are hard to detect with CT (NPV = 55.5%).

The three orthogonal images (*upper panels and lower right panel*) show the relationship with the elongated and narrowed left main coronary artery (*arrow*). The bottom left pane shows a 3D volume rendering that can be viewed at any angle for interventional planning.

Additional imaging utilizing CT or MRI in acute infectious pericarditis can be considered for association with clinical findings and echocardiography in complicated cases. Non-calcified pericardial thickening along with contrast enhancement of visceral and parietal surfaces of the pericardial sac are common findings. CT provides information on the nature of the effusion fluid by distinguishing between exudative versus transudative fluid (usually <10 HU), or hematomas.

### **CT VERSUS MRI OF THE HEART**

Throughout this chapter, comparisons between CT and MRI have illustrated the strengths and limitations of each. Both modalities give the surgeon valuable pre- and postoperative information. While the modality best suited for specific clinical indications evolves with the technology, at present certain generalizations can be made. Cardiac CT is invaluable in reoperative cardiac surgery as it offers higher quality noninvasive angiography of native coronary arteries and bypass grafts. Since 3D volume rendering with CT has higher quality and better spatial resolution, it is preferred for preoperative planning for reoperative CABG or minimally invasive cardiac surgery. All calcifications are poorly seen on MRI and superbly seen with CT, and thus CT is far superior in demonstrating coronary, myocardial, pericardial, and valvular calcifications. The same is true for mechanical valve prostheses; because of large areas of artifact on MR images, functional evaluation is only possible with CT. Finally, all patients with a surgical problem of the aorta require evaluation with CT.

The strengths of MRI include high temporal resolution, greater blood-myocardial image contrast, multiparametric functional evaluation, and techniques for myocardial tissue characterization. In addition, cardiac MRI is invaluable in assessing myocardial function, contractility, and actual tissue perfusion and viability. For these reasons, MRI remains the reference standard to assess biventricular volumes, function, and myocardial mass. A variety of MRI pulse sequences can accurately delineate areas of chronic myocardial infarction, identify certain specific cardiomyopathies, and confirm the presence of neoplasm. With the use of parallel imaging techniques to increase the speed of the MRI acquisition, very high temporal resolution (20-30 ms) can be obtained to study bioprosthetic and native valve function. In addition, measurements of flow parameters through a vessel crosssection can be used to, for example, accurately quantify valvular regurgitant lesions.

One distinct advantage of MRI over CT is that MRI delivers no patient radiation. As detailed in Part 1, the radiation exposure in ECG-gated CT is higher than that for CT of any other body part. In younger patients, who typically have less comorbid disease and may require multiple follow-up examinations over years or decades, MRI should be used when possible.

Dramatic progress in CT technology has enabled advanced cardiac imaging for cardiac surgery patients. CT has rapidly demonstrated broad ranging applicability, and in particular CT has revolutionized the preoperative assessment of patients

for reoperative surgery. Understanding the technical considerations will allow the surgeon to appreciate the inherent strengths and weaknesses of cardiac CT and to optimally communicate with the radiologist. This, in turn, will result in the best quality diagnostic examination in the vast majority of cardiac surgery patients.
