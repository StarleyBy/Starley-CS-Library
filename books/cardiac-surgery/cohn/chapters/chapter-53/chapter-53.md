# Interventional Therapy for Atrial and Ventricular Arrhythmias

Jason S. Chinitz • Robert E. Eckart • Laurence M. Epstein

Interventional therapies for the treatment of heart rhythm disorders have rapidly evolved over the past three decades, and continue to go through significant evolution. Though management options for cardiac arrhythmias were previously limited to pharmacologic therapy, the transformation and adaptation of surgical procedures to less invasive catheter-based approaches have led to a new paradigm in arrhythmia management. A fundamental understanding of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for treating heart rhythm disorders is critical to surgical specialties exposed to these rhythm disorders.

The recording of intracardiac signals through electrodes, and subsequent stimulation of the cardiac tissue, allowed for the concept of ablation. In 1967, Durrer and associates described reproducible initiation and termination of tachycardia in a patient with atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT) using a bypass tract. In 1969, the His bundle was first reproducibly recorded using a transvenous electrode catheter. The continued advancements allowing localization of intracardiac signals led to the study of a variety of tachyarrhythmias.

The concept emerged that critical regions of cardiac tissue were necessary for the initiation and propagation of tachyarrhythmias, and that if these regions could be interrupted, the tachyarrhythmia could be cured. Once catheter-based mapping strategies were developed to localize arrhythmogenic foci, surgical excision was contemplated. In 1968, a description of such a surgical procedure for the elimination of an accessory pathway (AP) was first published.<sup>3</sup> This heralded an era of nonpharmacologic treatment of tachyarrhythmias.

#### **ABLATION ACCESS**

### Surgical Ablation

A variety of arrhythmogenic foci and circuits were successfully mapped and ablated using surgical techniques in the 1970s.

Resection of an atrial focus felt to be responsible for an atrial tachycardia was reported in 1973. Identification of reentry circuits within the atrioventricular (AV) node allowed surgical dissection to treat AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT) without causing complete heart block. Although surgical ablation was therapeutic for a variety of tachyarrhythmias, the morbidity and mortality associated with thoracotomy and open-heart surgery limited its widespread application. Because most supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) are not life-threatening, the risk of the procedure limited its routine adoption. Surgical ablation was therefore limited to highly symptomatic patients refractory to medical therapy.

#### Catheter Ablation

In order to minimize the morbidity associated with surgical ablation, a method of using a transvenous catheter for the delivery of energy directly to cardiac tissue was sought. In 1981, Scheinman and colleagues reported the first catheter-based ablation procedure, describing the ablation of the His bundle in dogs. This same group performed the first closed-chest ablation procedure in a human; in a patient with atrial fibrillation (AF) and rate control refractory to medical therapy, a transvenous catheter was advanced to the His bundle region. Using a standard external direct-current (DC) defibrillator, they attached one of the defibrillator pads to the intracardiac catheter and used the second defibrillator pad as a cutaneous grounding pad. A series of DC shocks was delivered between the two pads and complete heart block, and thereby rate control, was achieved.

This closed-chest catheter-based procedure was quickly adopted to treat a variety of SVTs dependent on the AV node.<sup>8</sup> As experience was gained and dedicated ablation catheters were developed, energy could be more precisely directed to allow ablation of APs, atrial tachycardia, single limb of AVNRT, and ventricular tachycardia (VT).

Although DC shock ablation allowed for the initiation of catheter-based ablation, it had various limitations. Because

energy delivery was not titratable, such treatment had variable outcomes and complications, including massive damage to surrounding myocardium.<sup>6,7,9</sup> Because DC energy was delivered from the intracardiac electrode toward a cutaneous site, general anesthesia was required.

The introduction of radiofrequency (RF) energy as an ablative energy source heralded a new era in the catheter-based treatment of arrhythmias. RF energy had been used for decades by surgeons for surgical cutting and cautery and had a long history of safety and efficacy. Animal studies using RF energy for the treatment of arrhythmia were first described in 1987. Intracardiac RF energy produces controlled lesions at the catheter tip using resistive heating. In the primary energy source for catheter-based ablation, though alternative energy sources such as microwave, laser, high-intensity focused ultrasound, and cryothermal energy continue to be developed as a means to optimize patient safety and clinical outcomes.

#### **BIOPHYSICS OF ABLATION**

Ablation using RF as an energy source involves the delivery of sinusoidal alternating current between the catheter tip at the endocardial surface and a large grounding pad on the skin. The current has a frequency of 350 to 700 kHz. The principal method of tissue injury with RF delivery is thermal. As the RF energy passes through the tissue at the distal electrode of the ablation catheter, resistive heating occurs at the catheter tip, and deeper tissue heating occurs through passive heat conduction, producing coagulation necrosis, and a discrete homogenous lesion. To achieve irreversible tissue injury, a tissue temperature of 50 to 58°C is required. Lesion size is proportional to the tissue temperature, size of the ablation electrode, contact force between the catheter and tissue, and duration of RF delivery. 14 If subendocardial tissue temperature exceeds 100°C, steam may form within the tissue, resulting in a rapid expansion and crater formation and an audible "pop" during ablation. Much like DC shocks, such "steam pops" can cause unpredictable injury (eg, to surrounding normal conduction tissue) as well as local tissue rupture. Contemporary RF ablation catheters have a thermistor or thermocouple that allows for automatic adjustment of the power output to achieve a preset temperature at the electrode tip-tissue interface.

With endocardial ablation, the lesions produced are limited such that some intramural and epicardial foci and arrhythmia circuits may not be reachable with standard ablation. One method to increase lesion size and depth uses the principle of limiting coagulum development by increasing the electrode-tissue interface by increasing tip size. A limitation of larger catheter tips is that the larger surface area makes it difficult to regulate power delivery and achieve even temperatures.

Cooling the ablation catheter tip with saline irrigation, either within the catheter or external to the catheter, can also prevent coagulum formation at the tissue interface. This prevents a rise in impedance and allows for more energy

delivery deep into the tissue.<sup>17,18</sup> Irrigated RF catheters bathe the catheter tip internally using recirculating saline or externally through a porous electrode tip. These catheters continue to use RF as an energy source, with maximization of power delivery resulting in deeper lesions with a greater volume than with standard RF.<sup>19</sup> Cooled epicardial RF ablation probes have been US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, and transfers established catheter-based technology to a surgical approach for epicardial ablation of cardiac arrhythmias, used primarily in conjunction with other open cardiac surgical procedures.<sup>20,21</sup>

Because of concern about the irreversible nature of RF delivery, alternative energy sources have been developed that allow for a transient tissue injury before placement of permanent lesions. Cryoablation uses cryothermal energy delivered via a dedicated cryoablation catheter to produce gradual cooling of cardiac tissue to create local tissue damage. Hypothermia has been the preferred method of delivering linear lesions in surgical ablation. This technique uses pressurized nitrogen or nitrogen oxide flow through a catheter tip nozzle. As the gas expands beyond the obstruction, there is a temperature drop to as much as -90°C. The major advantage of cryothermal energy delivery relative to RF is its ability to deliver both transient and permanent injury to the tissue; the initial cooling phase ("Cryomapping") allows one to assess not only the impact of cryoablation on pathologic tissue (eg, anteroseptal APs, the slow limb of a dual AV node), but also the impact of potential lesion placement on nearby structures such as surrounding normal conduction tissue.<sup>22</sup> If the Cryomapping phase yields desirable results, then the temperature is lowered even further to a "freezing" stage. The ability to deliver reversible injury and catheter stabilization has made cryoablation increasingly popular in those cases in which the pathologic lesion is in close proximity to the AV node, and in younger patients in whom avoiding the need for pacemaker implantation is the highest priority.<sup>23</sup>

A second potential disadvantage to RF as an energy source is the risk of extracardiac tissue injury. For example, ablation of AF is becoming the most commonly performed electrophysiologic procedure, and is based on elimination or isolation of triggers for AF, which occur most commonly within the pulmonary veins (PVs). During catheter-based pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), ablation within the left atrium carries risks of collateral damage to surrounding structures, resulting in potentially highly morbid complications such as PV stenosis, atrioesophageal fistulas, and phrenic nerve paralysis. 24,25 As the esophagus runs adjacent to the posterior wall of the left atrium, this structure is highly vulnerable during ablation of AF. Though the rate of clinical atrioesophageal fistulas after ablation of AF is very low (around 0.04%), 26 the rate of intraoperative atrioesophageal perforation was as high as 1.3% in one open-chest series of patients undergoing linear lesions between PV ostia, to include the posterior wall overlaying the esophagus.<sup>27</sup> Current ablation strategies include methods to monitor for esophageal heating, such as continuous monitoring of esophageal temperature with an adjustable esophageal temperature probe.

## ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY STUDY PROCEDURAL PROTOCOL

#### Diagnostic Electrophysiology Study

Diagnostic localization of tachyarrhythmias involves positioning catheters in strategic locations within the heart to obtain intracardiac recordings from various cardiac chambers as well as from the His bundle. Venous access is typically obtained in the bilateral femoral veins using the Seldinger technique. Catheters of 4 to 6 French in size are passed under fluoroscopic guidance into the right atrium and right ventricle, as well as positioned just across the tricuspid valve (TV) on the septum to obtain His bundle recordings. To obtain recordings of the left atrium and left ventricle (LV), a catheter is guided into the coronary sinus (CS), which passes posteriorly behind the mitral annulus and drains into the right atrium (Fig. 53-1).

## Anticoagulation and Electrophysiology Studies

Direct recordings of the left heart are sometimes necessary and accomplished either by transseptal cannulation through the intra-atrial septum from the right atrium, or via a retrograde approach across the aortic valve into the LV, using catheters percutaneously placed into the femoral artery. Catheter and sheath placement within the left heart, however, imposes a risk of thrombus formation on the intracardiac catheter and

![](_page_2_Picture_7.jpeg)

**FIGURE 53-1** Radiograph in the right anterior oblique projection showing catheters positioned for a standard diagnostic electrophysiology procedure. Three nonsteerable diagnostic catheters are introduced from the inferior vena cava into the right heart. Two 4-French catheters with four electrodes are positioned in the region of the right atrial appendage (RA) and right ventricular apex (RV apex). A 5-French catheter with six electrodes is positioned across the tricuspid annulus to obtain a His bundle recording (His). A nonsteerable 6-French catheter is introduced via the right internal jugular vein into the coronary sinus (CS) to obtain left atrial and ventricular recordings. Finally, a deflectable 7-French ablation catheter is positioned in the region of the low right atrium.

at the site of ablation, with the resultant risk of stroke and thromboembolism. Animal models have determined that mural thrombus is evident in up to 50% of cases immediately after RF ablation. 10,28 In addition to the risk of mural thrombus at the site of ablation, there are mounting evidence of a systemic prothrombotic condition after RF ablation.<sup>29,30</sup> Therefore, during left-sided ablation, anticoagulation with intravenous heparin is typically administered throughout the procedure, and substantially reduces the thromboembolic risk. During ablation of AF, with the majority of the procedure performed within the left atrium, heparin is administered to achieve and maintain a target activated clotting time of 300 to > 400 seconds throughout the procedure.<sup>31</sup> Many patients undergoing ablation, particularly for AF, are on chronic systemic anticoagulation. Historically anticoagulation with warfarin was held prior to the procedure, and the patient was bridged with heparin in the periprocedural period. This strategy has now been recognized to be associated with a high incidence of bleeding complications, and now ablations are routinely performed in patients on uninterrupted therapeutic anticoagulation. In the event of procedure-related bleeding complications such as cardiac tamponade, anticoagulation can be reversed with protamine, fresh frozen plasma, and/or prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC). While most experience has been with continuous warfarin, evidence is emerging that ablations can also be safely performed in the setting of anticoagulation with the novel oral thrombin inhibitor or Factor Xa inhibitors, though clinical experience is limited and options for reversal of anticoagulation, when necessary, are still in development.<sup>31</sup>

Once diagnostic catheters are positioned in preparation of an electrophysiologic study, programmed electrical stimulation is performed to induce and study the tachyarrhythmia. Sometimes modulation of the autonomic nervous system is required to induce tachyarrhythmias with the infusion of atropine, isoproterenol, or epinephrine.<sup>32</sup> Once an optimal site for ablation is determined, a steerable ablation catheter is positioned at the target site, and energy is delivered.

At the end of the procedure, all catheters and sheaths are removed and manual pressure is applied to the access sites to achieve hemostasis. If the patient was heparinized for the procedure, sheath removal is delayed until anticoagulation reverses, either when the activated clotting time is less than 200 to 250 seconds, or after administration of protamine. The patient is placed on bed rest for 4 or more hours. Routine follow-up studies are not warranted unless required to assess for a complication. As mentioned, because of the risk of thromboembolic events, patients are frequently sent home on aspirin, thienopyridines, low-molecular-weight heparin, warfarin, or a combination of risk-appropriate antithrombotic therapies depending on the type and extent of ablation performed.

### Complications Associated with Electrophysiology Studies

In referring patients for catheter ablation, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits of the procedure for the individual

patient. Most tachyarrhythmias, although causing a variety of symptoms, are generally hemodynamically well tolerated and are not life-threatening. Thus awareness of the potential complications of catheter ablation is necessary before referring a patient. Complications can be divided into those involving vascular access, catheter manipulation within the heart, and ablation.

Access-related complications include pain, adverse drug reaction from anesthesia and sedation, infection, thrombophlebitis, bleeding at the site of access, hematoma, arteriovenous fistula, and pseudoaneurysm formation. Arterial damage or dissection may also result. Systemic or pulmonary thromboembolism can occur, most seriously resulting in transient ischemic attack or stroke. It is felt that performance of complex ablations while on systemic anticoagulation and with externally irrigated tipped catheters may reduce the risk of mural thrombus and thereby periprocedural embolic events. However, there may be an increased risk of access complications in a patient with therapeutic anticoagulation.<sup>33,34</sup>

Complications associated with placement of intracardiac catheters can be more life threatening. These include perforation of a cardiac chamber or the CS, resulting in hemopericardium, cardiac tamponade, and potentially coronary artery injury. Programmed electrical stimulation can result in the induction of hemodynamically unstable tachyarrhythmias such as VT or fibrillation. Catheter manipulation can also result in usually transient but sometimes permanent damage to valvular apparatus or the conduction of the right or left bundle branches owing to mechanical trauma.

RF delivery to cardiac tissue is associated with risk of collateral damage to intracardiac and extracardiac structures. Inadvertent ablation of the normal conduction system may result in complete heart block requiring permanent pacing. Perforation of a cardiac chamber or vascular structure can also occur with catheter manipulation or RF delivery; small perforations can often be adequately controlled with percutaneous pericardiocentesis and reversal of anticoagulation if present, however, if cardiac bleeding does not stop with these conservative measures an urgent open surgical approach is needed. Collateral damage to coronary circulation can result in myocardial infarction, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock. Phrenic nerve paralysis can occur due to ablation in proximity to the right or left phrenic nerves, which course along the pericardium. Ablation near the PVs within the left atrium can result in venous stenosis and pulmonary hypertension. Ablation in the posterior wall of the left atrium, as is routinely performed during ablation of AF, can result in damage to the esophagus, including esophageal ulcer formation and the potentially fatal complication of atrial-esophageal fistula.<sup>35</sup> Given these risks, a center undertaking these procedures must be prepared to urgently treat these potential complication. All operators performing electrophysiologic studies should be trained in pericardiocentesis, and certain procedures associated with higher risks of perforation should only be performed at centers with available cardiac surgeons in the event of severe complications.36

An 8-year prospective study published in 1996 of 3966 procedures found an overall complication rate of 3.1% for

ablative and 1.1% for diagnostic procedures, with complications more likely to occur in elderly patients and those with systemic disease.<sup>37</sup> A more recent series evaluating ablations performed in patients across a series of age ranges identified a rate of procedural complications of 1.3%, with no significant differences between patients under 70 years of age relative to septagenarians or octogenarians.<sup>38</sup> Various studies have shown very low mortality rates directly attributable to the electrophysiology study.

## DIAGNOSTIC ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY TECHNIQUES

A variety of techniques have been developed to elucidate the origin and mechanism of tachyarrhythmia propagation. Some of these techniques involve pacing in sinus rhythm, whereas others are performed during the tachyarrhythmia. Diagnostic studies typically involve programmed electrical stimulation with pacing at particular intervals to initiate a tachyarrhythmia, assess its response to pacing maneuvers, or terminate it.<sup>39</sup>

Activation mapping is used to localize the origin of various tachycardias. It involves positioning a mapping catheter in various intracardiac locations during the tachyarrhythmia, to identify a site where activation is earliest, and precedes any other intracardiac activation or corresponding surface P wave or QRS. The earliest site of activation during a focal tachycardia must by definition be the source of the tachycardia. This technique is most useful for localizing focal atrial tachycardias, stable VT, and APs.

Entrainment mapping is used for localization of re-entrant circuits, and is often used in conjuction with activation mapping to identify targets for ablation. In entrainment mapping, pacing is performed from intracardiac sites during tachycardia and slightly faster, to penetrate the arrhythmia circuit and entrain the tachycardia when pacing from sites within the reentrant circuit, the time from the last paced stimulus to the first return signal on the pacing electrode (called the "postpacing interval") should equal the tachycardia cycle length. Since you are pacing from within the circuit, one cycle results in the "return" signal which is the same of the tachycardia cycle length. Pacing from sites more remote from the circuit will produce a post-pacing interval greater than the tachycardia cycle length. Because pacing is not within the circuit, the time to the "return" signal is the sum of one revolution around the circuit (the tachycardia cycle length) plus the time it takes to get to the circuit and back from the circuit. The difference between the post-pacing interval and the tachycardia cycle length can be used to determine whether sites are within the arrhythmia circuit and therefore guide ablation. This strategy is particularly useful for mapping atrial flutter, re-entrant atrial tachycardia, and scar-related VT.<sup>42</sup>

Pace mapping is another method used to localize the origin of a tachycardia, with particular usefulness in mapping VT or ventricular ectopy.<sup>43</sup> In this method, pacing is performed during sinus rhythm at various intracardiac locations, and the paced QRS morphology is compared to the

QRS morphology during tachycardia; the disparity in QRS morphologies can be assessed and the catheter repositioned until a match is obtained. At the site of tachycardia origin or myocardial exit, pacing is likely to produce a QRS morphology identical to that observed during tachycardia since the remainder of the heart is being activated in a similar manner.<sup>44</sup>

Mapping may also be performed based on anatomical landmarks. For example, ablation of the slow AV nodal pathway for the treatment of AVNRT is performed by ablating well-defined targets identified by fluoroscopy with or without the assistance of an electroanatomic mapping system. In common right atrial flutter, in which conduction across the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) is necessary to sustain the arrhythmia, anatomical landmarks are used for ablation to create a line of block between the tricuspid annulus and the inferior vena cava (IVC).<sup>45</sup>

In various clinical situations, a combination of these mapping techniques may be used to localize an appropriate target for ablation.

### **Advanced Mapping Techniques**

The success of ablation is dependent on precise localization of arrhythmogenic foci and critical parts of arrhythmogenic circuits. Advanced mapping techniques have been developed as adjuncts to conventional mapping methods to improve the efficacy and safety of catheter ablation. The systems described below are useful to improve the rapidity and precision of mapping arrhythmias, while decreasing the need for fluoroscopy.

The CARTO electroanatomical mapping system (Biosense-Webster, Diamond Bar, CA) uses a magnetic field and emitted currents to localize a mapping catheter in threedimensional space. Various locator pads placed beneath the patient's chest generate ultra-low-intensity magnetic fields in the form of spheres that decay in strength. A sensor in the catheter tip measures the relative strength and hence the distance from each of the pads, triangulating the temporalspatial location of the catheter. For activation mapping, electrodes at the catheter tip record local electrograms, and the local activation times acquired from various mapping points are reconstructed on a three-dimensional map relative to a reference catheter, and presented on the map in a colorcoded fashion. By acquiring multiple mapping points during tachycardia, the sequence of arrhythmia propagation can be reconstructed. Voltage maps can also be obtained to delineate regions of scar and diseased myocardium.<sup>46</sup>

Another commonly used nonflouroscopic three-dimensional electroanatomic mapping system is the EnSite system (Ensite NavX and EnSite Velocity, St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN), which consists of surface electrode patches applied to several places on the patient's body. To create a three-dimensional model of the chamber of interest in the heart, an electrical signal is transmitted between the patches, and the signal is sensed by the catheters within the heart; as the catheter is moved within the chamber, information from the intracardiac catheters including location, activation timing, and local electrogram amplitude is relayed to the computer

system that generates the three-dimensional model. Cardiac electrical activity, including activation and voltage maps, can be superimposed on the anatomic model. The EnSite Velocity System can display the real-time position of conventional electrophysiology catheters, and can provide visualization and navigation of up to 128 electrodes on a combination of catheters.<sup>47</sup>

Intracardiac ultrasound catheters have had substantial benefits in improving the safety and efficacy of ablation, by providing real-time visualization of intracardiac structures. Radial array intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) (9 MHz Ultra ICE, Boston-Scientific, Natick, MA) may be positioned within the atria, allowing visualization of the interatrial septum, thereby enhancing the safety of transseptal punctures. Phased array intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) has extended the principles of IVUS for electrophysiologic use. 48 Newer ICE catheters are steerable and have Doppler capability (Acuson, AcuNav, Mountain View, CA). In addition to guiding transseptal punctures, ICE catheters allow the accurate targeting of anatomical sites such as PV ostia and papillary muscles. 49 They are also useful for imaging diagnostic and ablation catheter positions and visualization of tissue contact for optimal ablation. Additional benefit to ICE is integration with electroanatomical mapping systems to allow for noncontact real-time reconstruction of cardiac structures (CartoSound, Biosense-Webster, Diamond Bar, CA) (Fig. 53-2).

#### **CLINICAL APPLICATIONS**

Using the techniques described in the preceding sections, most focal and re-entrant tachyarrhythmias can be mapped and targeted for catheter-based ablation.

### Atrioventricular Nodal Re-entrant Tachycardia

AVNRT is the most common form of SVT identified during electrophysiologic studies. This tachycardia can present at any age, although most patients who present for medical attention are in their forties and the majority are females. <sup>50,51</sup> Advances in catheter ablation of this tachycardia has made it a first-line therapy for those symptomatic patients not wishing to take long-term medications. <sup>52</sup>

AVNRT has a re-entrant mechanism using two distinct electrical pathways within the AV nodal tissue. The common pathways are known as "slow" and "fast" based on their relative conduction properties. The anatomical location of these pathways is variable but generally located within the triangle of Koch in the septal right atrium, which is bounded by the tricuspid annulus and the tendon of Todaro with the CS at the base. The apex of the triangle is the His bundle at the membranous septum where it passes through the central fibrous body. The anterior third of the triangle contains the compact AV node and the fast pathway, and the inferior and posterior portion, near the CS ostium, is the typical location for the slow pathway (Fig. 53-3).<sup>53</sup>

(B) A voltage map of the left ventricle is shown in the RAO view, superimposed over the corresponding echocardiographic image.

![](_page_5_Figure_4.jpeg)

**FIGURE 53-3** (A) Diagrammatic representation of typical atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia. Surface ECG shows narrow complex tachycardia with no clear P waves. The re-entrant circuit (*blue arrows*) consists of the posterior slow pathway region acting as the antegrade limb, and the anterior fast pathway region acting as the retrograde limb. The slow pathway target site is located between the coronary sinus os (CS) and the tricuspid valve annulus (TV). IVC = inferior vena cava; RA = right atrium; RV = right ventricle; SVC = superior vena cava. (B) Surface ECG showing precordial leads in AVNRT. This demonstrates that the retrograde P waves are barely discernible in some leads. In  $V_1$ , it forms a pseudo r' wave (*arrow*). P waves are also visible in the terminal portions of QRS complexes in  $V_2$  and  $V_3$  but not in the lateral leads.

In the typical form of AVNRT, antegrade conduction from the atrium to the ventricle occurs over the slow AV nodal pathway, and the retrograde conduction through the AV node occurs over the fast pathway. Because conduction in the retrograde direction is fast, the atria and ventricle are depolarized almost simultaneously. Thus the electrocardiographic feature of this tachycardia is P waves that are inscribed within the QRS and thus not seen or barely discernible at the termination of the QRS complex.<sup>54</sup> The arrhythmia is usually triggered by an atrial premature complex (APC). The refractory period of the fast pathway is longer than that of the slow. Under the right conditions, the premature impulse blocks in the fast pathway and proceeds antegrade down the slow pathway, resulting in marked PR prolongation (a "jump"). Since nothing came down the fast pathway the impulse can turn around and conduct retrograde up the fast pathway resulting in an atrial echo beat. If the slow pathway has recovered the tachycardia can continue.<sup>55</sup> In fewer than 10% of cases, the circuit is reversed. In atypical AVNRT, antegrade conduction occurs over the fast pathway and retrograde conduction occurs over the slow pathway. Thus the ECG of this tachycardia shows inverted P waves in the inferior leads denoting retrograde activation of the atria with a longer RP segment owing to slower retrograde conduction.<sup>56</sup> Less commonly other AV nodal circuits may be present such as "slow-slow" AVNRT, using antegrade conduction down one slow pathway, and retrograde conduction utilizing another "slow pathway," with different functional and anatomic properties. These alternate AV nodal pathways occasionally have leftward extensions creating eccentric retrograde atrial activation patterns.<sup>55</sup>

Slow pathway ablation has a high degree of success for elimination of AVNRT, with a recurrence rate in the range of 2 to 7%. Complete AV block can occur as a complication of attempted slow pathway ablation in less than 1% (range 0 to 3%) of cases.<sup>57</sup> The North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (NASPE) self-reported surveys on 4249 patients who underwent slow pathway ablations had success rates of greater than 96% and complication rates of less than 1%.<sup>58,59</sup>

## Atrioventricular Re-entrant Tachycardia

About 30% of SVTs are caused by AVRT. This is a re-entrant tachycardia using the AV node and an AP. These APs are muscular bundles or remnants of conductive tissue from embryonic development that span the normally electrically inert tricuspid and mitral valve annulus and provide an independent path of conduction between the atria and the ventricles outside of the AV node. AVRT is part of the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome of ventricular pre-excitation and symptomatic arrhythmias. The most common APs connect the atrium to the ventricular myocardium, but other APs may connect the atria or AV node to the His-Purkinje system. APs can conduct in the antegrade direction, retrograde direction, or both. In sinus rhythm, in patients with antegrade conduction over the AP there is preexcitation of the ventricles.

Ventricular activation is a result of "fusion" between activation over the AP and over the AV node. The degree of preexcitation is determined by the conduction velocity through the AV node and the time the sinus impulse takes to get to the AP. Preexcitation is manifested on the surface electrocardiogram by a short PR segment and slurring of the onset of the QRS, known as the delta wave. This slurring is due to slower "muscle to muscle" conduction in the ventricle from site of AP insertion. Absence of these findings does not exclude an AP. This may be due to a "latent AP" where there is antegrade conduction but the majority of the ventricle is being activated by the normal conduction system. This is most often seen in young patients with rapid AV nodal conduction and a far left lateral AP. In addition, up to 30% of AP conduct in the retrograde direction only ("concealed pathways").60

The term "WPW syndrome" is the combination of ventricular preexcitation on the surface ECG and symptomatic palpitations. However, it is often used to refer to any patient with an AP and SVT. Patients with WPW typically present with palpitation caused by rapid heart rate. This may be the result of AVRT or any supraventricular arrhythmia, including AF, with resulting rapid AV conduction via the AP. Associated symptoms may be mild such as palpitation and shortness of breath, or as severe as syncope and sudden death. 61,62 Sudden death is a very rare complication of rapidly conducting APs, and may be caused by ventricular fibrillation resulting from the extremely rapid ventricular activation over the AP during AF.

Indications for ablation of APs include patients with symptomatic AVRT or those with atrial tachyarrhythmias with rapid ventricular conduction who fail or do not wish to undergo medical therapy. Relative indications for ablations include asymptomatic patients with "high risk" APs that are capable of rapid conduction thus posing a small risk of sudden death as the initial presentation of AF. Similarly, patients in high-risk professions, those with family history of sudden death, or those mentally distraught over their condition may be candidates for ablation.

In the typical or orthodromic form of AVRT, antegrade conduction from the atrium to the ventricle occurs over the AV node and retrograde conduction occurs over the AP. In this form of AVRT, the P wave in the tachycardia follows the preceding QRS complex, resulting in a "short RP" tachycardia but often a longer RP segment on the surface ECG than seen in AVNRT (Fig. 53-4). In the rare antidromic form of AVRT, antegrade conduction occurs over the AP with retrograde conduction over the AV node, or more commonly a second AP. This results in eccentric depolarization of the ventricle, producing a wide complex tachycardia with retrograde P waves that can be easily mistaken for VT with one-to-one ventriculoatrial conduction.

An unusual form of AVRT utilizes a slowly conducting or decremental AP. Since conduction in both limbs, antegrade AV node and retrograde AP, is slow the tachycardia can be very stable and almost incessant. These tachycardias were misnamed the "permanent form of reciprocating junctional

**FIGURE 53-4** (A) Diagrammatic representation of atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia. This macro re-entrant circuit (*gray arrows*) uses the AV node and an accessory pathway (AP), in this case a right lateral pathway. In orthodromic AVRT, antegrade conduction occurs over the AV node and retrograde conduction occurs over the AP. Because of the conduction delay from the His-Purkinje system through the ventricular myocardium to reach the AP, retrograde P waves are discernible after the QRS complexes (*arrow*). In antedromic AVRT, the re-entrant circuit is reversed and surface ECG shows P waves that closely precede the QRS complexes. CS = coronary sinus; IVC = inferior vena cava; RA = right atrium; RV = right ventricle; SVC = superior vena cava; TV = tricuspid valve. (B) Intracardiac recording of atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia with termination of eccentric conduction over the accessory pathway during RF ablation. The tracing at 50-mm-per-second speed shows four surface leads (VI, II, I, and aVF) and intracardiac recording from catheters: ablation (ABL); His distal, mid, and proximal; as well as right ventricular apex (RVA). The first three beats of the tracing show evidence of eccentric conduction over an accessory pathway: short PR segment and delta wave. With onset of RF energy (RF On) from the ablation catheter positioned in the region of shortest AV conduction, conduction becomes normal within two beats, with normalization of the PR segment and loss of the delta wave.

tachycardia" or PJRT. They tend to be relatively slow (100 to 140 BPM) and can be mistaken for sinus tachycardia. On the surface ECG this is a "long RP" tachycardia with a short PR interval and inverted P waves in the inferior leads. It is important to recognize this entity as the incessant elevated heart rate can lead to a tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy. These pathways are almost always posteroseptal in location and ablation results in normalization of ejection fraction in most cases.<sup>64</sup>

Additional unusual APs are those that conduct slowly in the antegrade direction, connect into the specialized conduction system, and support preexcited tachycardias with a wide QRS. These are known as Mahiem pathways in which there is a slowly conducting antegrade AP connecting from the atrium to a fascicle (atriofascicular pathway) or from the AV node to a fascicle (nodofascicular pathway).

The 1998 NASPE prospective catheter ablation registry reported on 654 patients with a 94% success rate.<sup>59</sup> Success rates are lower (in the range of 84-88%) for septal and right free wall pathways. 65-67 Mortality rates are less than 1% and nonfatal complications occur in about 4%.59 The major challenges of AP ablation are the location of APs near the normal conduction system and those that are epicardial in location. Ablation of pathways that are anteroseptal and midseptal in location carry a higher risk of causing complete heart block due to ablation near the compact AV node or His bundle. In these cases, alternate ablative energy sources such as cryoablation may offer a potentially safer alternative due to its ability to deliver reversible injury, permitting of the resulting effects, prior to irreversible lesion formation. <sup>22,68,69</sup> However, the vast majority of these pathways can be safely ablated with standard RF energy.

## Atrial Tachycardia

Atrial tachycardias depend wholly on atrial tissue for initiation and maintenance of the tachycardia. Ectopic atrial tachycardia, sinoatrial nodal re-entrant tachycardia, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, atrial flutter, and AF can all be considered atrial tachycardias. Multifocal atrial tachycardia is caused by multiple foci of abnormal automaticity or triggered activity and is not amenable to curative catheter ablation.<sup>70</sup>

Focal atrial tachycardias, a less common type of SVT, form about 10% of all SVTs referred for electrophysiologic studies. These arrhythmias are more common in patients with structural heart disease. Indications for ablation include failure or intolerance of medical therapy. Rarely, incessant tachycardias can lead to cardiomyopathy. With control of heart rate or restoration of sinus rhythm, myocardial dysfunction can be reversed, although there may be a delayed risk of sudden death that necessitates use of a defibrillator. Ti-73

Surface ECG features of focal atrial tachycardia include abnormal P wave morphology or axis that are typically close to the following QRS complexes (long RP tachycardia). Mapping and ablation of atrial tachycardias can be more difficult than ablation of other SVTs, as they can originate from anywhere in the right or left atrium, or within the interatrial

septum and venous/arterial structures. Fortunately, there are specific anatomical regions that have a high incidence of foci and serve as primary targets, including the crista terminalis, atrial appendages, CS ostium, valve annuli, and pulmonary vein ostia.<sup>74</sup> Focal atrial tachycardia is frequently amenable to catheter ablation by targeting the site of origin of the arrhythmia, typically by identifying the earliest site of atrial activation using activation mapping. However, ablation success rates for AT are lower than that for other SVTs; the wide range of possible locations of AT origin require that the arrhythmia be present or readily inducible at the time of mapping, so that it can be localized for successful ablation. Success rates for ablation of focal AT have been reported to be 86% on average, with a recurrence rate of 8%. Complications from ablation include cardiac perforation, phrenic nerve damage, AV block, and sinus node dysfunction, with a combined incidence of 1 to 2% in experienced centers.<sup>63</sup>

Sinoatrial nodal reentry tachycardias occur infrequently and experience with catheter ablation of these tachycardias is more limited, however possible. As the name suggests the tachycardia is due to reentry in the tissue in and around the sinus node. The P wave morphology is identical to sinus rhythm but the tachycardia can start and stop suddenly, unlike sinus.<sup>75</sup>

Inappropriate sinus tachycardia is a not a well-defined disorder. It appears to result from a combination of autonomic dysfunction (when part of the postural orthostatic tachycardic syndrome, POTS) and perhaps some other endocrine and psychiatric component. While catheter ablation has been utilized as a "last resort" it is challenging because of the variability and diffuse location of sinoatrial tissue, as well as its multifactorial causes not treated by ablation. 76 Catheter ablation may be complicated by sinoatrial node dysfunction and persistent junctional escape rhythm, necessitating implantation of a pacemaker. Even if the resting heart rate is reduced with nodal modification, symptoms may continue with episodes of tachycardia. Catheter ablation is therefore generally avoided, in favor of a multidisciplinary approach, including cardiovascular, endocrinologic, and psychiatric evaluation and pharmacologic management.<sup>77</sup>

#### **Atrial Flutter**

Atrial flutter is a type of atrial tachycardia that uses a macro reentrant circuit contained within the atria. A variety of natural and surgical barriers to conduction can create a re-entrant circuit within the atria. "Typical" or "isthmus dependent" atrial flutter involves a right atrial circuit, with an obligate limb in the isthmus of tissue between the IVC and the TV annulus, known as the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI). The flutter circuit is bound anteriorly by the TV annulus, and posteriorly by the superior vena cava, crista terminalis, IVC, eustachian ridge, and CS (Fig. 53-5).<sup>78</sup>

In the most common form of typical, isthmus-dependent atrial flutter, the circuit transverses the right atrium in a counterclockwise manner in the frontal plane. Because the anatomy of the right atrium is elongated in a caudad-cephalad direction, a typical atrial flutter spends large portions of circuit

![](_page_9_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 53-5** Diagrammatic representation of typical or counterclockwise right atrial flutter. Surface ECG shows large inverted P waves in the inferior leads. Lead III above shows 2:1 AV conduction with "sawtooth" flutter waves. The re-entrant circuit is confined to the right atrium by the tricuspid valve annulus (TV) and barriers to conduction within the right atrium. These include the superior vena cava (SVC), crista terminalis (CT), inferior vena cava (IVC), eustachian ridge (ER), and coronary sinus (CS). The isthmus between the IVC and TV is the preferred target for ablation.

activation going superior along the interatrial septum; therefore, on the surface ECG in leads II, III, and a VF, the P waves (called "flutter waves") are negative and have a sawtooth appearance. In  $\rm V_1$ , the flutter waves are usually upright and in  $\rm V_6$  they are inverted. Clockwise isthmus-dependent flutter uses the same circuit but in a reversed direction, and the ECG also shows a reversed pattern with upright flutter waves in the inferior leads, and flutter waves that are negative in  $\rm V_1$  and upright in  $\rm V_6$ . This surface ECG morphology is suggestive of the circuit but needs intracardiac confirmation.  $^{79}$ 

Catheter ablation for typical atrial flutter involves ablation in the CTI, by transecting the flutter circuit between the IVC and TV annulus. Long-term success rates for eradication of CTI-dependent atrial flutter have been reported to be approximately 87 to 95%. <sup>80</sup> Given high success rates and relatively infrequent complications, ablation has become the first line of therapy for recurrent typical atrial flutter. Despite successful treatment of flutter, up to one half of patients may develop de novo AF after flutter ablation during long-term follow-up, mandating careful monitoring for recurrent arrhythmias prior to cessation of anticoagulation even after successful ablation. <sup>81,82</sup>

Although the isthmus-dependent right atrial circuit described in the preceding is the most common type of flutter, a variety of other macro re-entrant circuits in the right and left atria are also possible, and are termed "atypical atrial flutters". These are more common in patients with underlying heart disease, or in those having previously undergone atrial ablation or cardiac surgery. <sup>49,83-85</sup> Mapping and ablation

of these arrhythmias are now also routinely performed. However, the success rate is somewhat lower than that for typical isthmus-dependent atrial flutter.

Incisional scars from prior cardiac surgery can be the substrate for re-entrant atrial arrhythmias. <sup>86-88</sup> The most common post-surgical atrial tachycardia is an atypical atrial flutter related to a lateral right atrial incision. Activation mapping typically demonstrates a circuit encircling a region of scar related to the incision. Ablation from the end of the scar to either the superior vena cava or more commonly the IVC is often curative (Fig. 53-6). <sup>89</sup>

Atrial arrhythmias are also common in patients who have undergone prior atrial ablation, particularly after more extensive left atrial ablation performed for persistent AF, or after a surgical Maze procedure (see below). These tachycardias may be a result of macro reentry, micro reentry, or a focal source. Common macro re-entrant circuits in these patients include typical right atrial flutter or atypical flutters encircling the mitral annulus or involving the roof of the left atrium. Reentrant circuits may result from incomplete lines of block created during the prior intervention, or through alternative pathways such as the musculature surrounding the CS.<sup>90</sup> These tachycardias are often incessant and may be highly symptomatic and difficult to control with antiarrhythmic medications. Catheter ablation is therefore frequently pursued to target these recurrent arrhythmias and restore sinus rhythm. Ablation of these post-ablation arrhythmias are often delayed until 2 or 3 months after the index ablation, once the inflammatory response to the initial ablation has passed and the lesions have completely healed. During electrophysiologic study, the circuit of these arrhythmias can usually be determined using a combination of activation and entrainment mapping.<sup>91</sup> The main principle of ablation involves interrupting these circuits in obligate limbs, such as the left atrial roof or lateral mitral isthmus, by ablating between electrically inert anatomic barriers, such as the mitral annulus and the electrically isolated PV antrum.92

#### **Atrial Fibrillation**

Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia effecting upwards of 8 million Americans. AF is often highly symptomatic due to irregular and/or rapid ventricular rates and loss of AV synchrony. Patients can also be completely asymptomatic, but are still at risk of stroke, heart failure, and dilated cardiomyopathy due to prolonged periods of tachycardia. 73,93 The primary goal of pharmacologic therapy is prevention of thromboembolism in those at risk using systemic anticoagulation. Pharmacologic therapy for control of AFrelated symptoms, however, has limited efficacy, carries risk of proarrhythmia and other systemic toxicities, and has not demonstrated a benefit in the reduction of stroke or mortality in large trials. 94-97 Catheter ablation of AF has consistently shown greater efficacy in maintenance of sinus rhythm than antiarrhythmic drugs and avoids long-term drug-related side effects. Ablation therefore has an expanding role in the restoration of sinus rhythm and control of AF-related symptoms,

Panel A shows a voltage map, with regions of low voltage (nonpurple regions on map), and electrically nonexcitable tissue (gray dots) representing abnormal or scarred atrial myocardium, likely related to the lateral atriotomy incision site. Panel B shows an activation map during tachycardia, demonstrating a macro re-entrant circuit around the scarred segments in the right atrium. Ablation lesions between electrically inert regions of the right atrium (red dots in panel A) terminated the tachycardia.

particularly after failure or intolerance of at least one antiarrhythmic drug trial. In patients with tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy, ablation is also often considered when medical therapy is inadequate for persistent rate control, or when restoration of sinus rhythm is the priority.<sup>31</sup>

The initial surgical Maze procedure was performed in 1987, and with several modifications aimed to make the procedure more tolerable, the Cox Maze III procedure has shown excellent long-term success rates, with an operative mortality of 2 to 3%. 98,99 This procedure is based on the concept that AF consists of multiple re-entrant circuits within the atria, and that creation of lines of conduction block between nonconducting atrial structures may preclude propagation of arrhythmic circuits and such that AF cannot sustain. 100 It is termed the "MAZE" in addition to creating lines of conduction block there is an attempt to avoid areas of atrial isolation and therefore promote atrial contraction in sinus rhythm. The electrical impulse from the sinus node therefore traverses a "MAZE" as it makes its way to the AV node. This procedure has been limited by the need for open-heart surgery with its mortality, morbidity, and expense, as well as post-op sinus node dysfunction requiring a pacemaker and the creation of new atrial arrhythmias. The surgical experience with the Maze procedure has led to the development of both more minimally invasive surgical approaches and a catheter-based approach.

Attempts at catheter-based left atrial or biatrial lesions for the purpose of replicating the Maze were met with limited success because of the prolonged procedure times, high risk of complications, and limited efficacy. 101 As understanding of the mechanism of AF has evolved, attempts to block propagation of atrial fibrillatory circuits have given way to attempted ablation of the fibrillatory triggers. When the identification of AF triggers arising from the PVs was first described by Haissaguerre et al. in 1998, the discipline of catheter-based ablation of AF emerged into the forefront of clinical electrophysiology. In a series of patients undergoing a left-sided catheter Maze procedure it was discovered that rapidly firing premature atrial contractions arising from the musculature of the PVs were triggering AF. Ablation of these foci eliminated AF in some patients. 102 Catheter-based ablation targeting triggers within the PVs has now gained worldwide acceptance as a therapeutic option for patients with symptomatic AF.

An early approach to PVI involved segmental isolation of each PV by mapping the location of the connecting muscular fibers. <sup>103</sup> This procedure has since evolved to an empiric electrical isolation of the PVs, with complete encircling of the PV antra, typically performed as ipsilateral pairs (Fig. 53-7). <sup>104,105</sup> In patients with paroxysmal AF, antral PVI is often sufficient to prevent recurrent AF. Ablation of additional atrial substrate is often needed to restore sinus rhythm in patients with more persistent forms of AF. <sup>106</sup>

![](_page_11_Figure_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 53-7** Electroanatomic map showing a series of radiofrequency ablation lesions (red and pink dots) encircling the pulmonary vein antra as ipsilateral pairs. Panel A: posterior-anterior view; panel B: right anterior oblique view.

Due to the high prevalence of AF in the general population, along with the increasing success of ablation, catheter ablation for AF has become one of the most commonly performed electrophysiologic procedures. However, methods for optimizing outcomes are still in evolution. Approaches beyond PVI, particularly for patients with persistent AF, continue to be evaluated. While in most patients with paroxysmal AF the arrhythmia is driven by PV triggers, as the arrhythmia becomes more persistent or occurs in more diseased atria, AF becomes maintained by arrhythmogenic atrial substrate. Those with a more permanent form of AF have been demonstrated to have either atrial scarring or structural disease in 65%. This arrhythmogenic substrate may be manifest as regions of electrical block and complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) on intracardiac recordings, and may be targeted during catheter ablation.<sup>106</sup>

Whether ablation targeting additional atrial substrate, including CFAE ablation or creating additional lines of ablation to segment the atria (similar to the Maze procedure), improve ablation success is still under investigation. In randomized trials, the addition of targeting of CFAEs to a conventional PV antral isolation has not resulted in increased freedom from recurrent arrhythmia. 107,108 In a study comparing the efficacy of adding linear lesions to PVI alone, additional lines did improve the maintenance of sinus rhythm, although the results were much more apparent in those with persistent AF at baseline. 109 As discussed above, additional lines of ablation also predispose to recurrent atrial tachycardias, which have the potential to conduct rapidly and may be even more symptomatic than was the original arrhythmia. Though PVI alone may be sufficient for most patients with paroxysmal AF, those with persistent arrhythmia often require more extensive ablation to terminate AF and prevent recurrence. In all patients, targeting additional substrate in the pulmonary venous antra appears to have a beneficial role over ostial isolation alone. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis found a highly significant lower rate of recurrent arrhythmias in patients undergoing wide antral PVI relative to segmental ostial isolation (odds ratio 0.42, p < .00001), including a much lower AF recurrence rate (odds ratio 0.33), despite a trend towards greater incidence of left atrial tachycardia occurrence in the wide antral circumferential ablation group. <sup>110</sup> In addition, ostial ablation increases the risk of PV stenosis, which is largely avoided by wide circumferential ablation.

Due to the evolving nature of AF ablation and range of techniques and experience, as well as nonuniform methods of follow-up and postoperative surveillance, accurate data regarding the efficacy and long-term outcomes of the procedure are limited. Furthermore, results are also dependent on individual patient factors, particularly the pattern of preexisting AF (universally worse outcomes in patients with persistent AF), patient comorbidities, and left atrial size. There is now strong evidence that ablation improves maintenance of sinus rhythm greater than antiarrhythmic medications. One randomized multicenter comparison of ablation versus antiarrhythmic drugs in patients with paroxysmal AF who failed at least one medication found freedom from documented symptomatic recurrence in 66% of patients treated with ablation compared to 16% of patients treated with medications at 9 months (hazard ratio 0.30, p < .001), as well as greater improvement in symptom severity score and quality of life in the ablation group. 111 Another meta-analysis comparing ablation to medical management in patients with paroxysmal AF found that at 1 year, ablation was associated with a 16-fold rate of freedom from recurrent AF (odds ratio, 15.78; 95% CI, 10.07-24.73) and with decreased hospitalization for cardiovascular causes (rate ratio, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.10-0.23).<sup>112</sup>

One-year outcomes after AF ablation, particularly in well-selected patients with paroxysmal arrhythmia, have demonstrated impressive results; the A4 trial showed at 1 year, 23%

of those randomized to antiarrhythmic drug therapy, and 89% of those randomized to ablation had no recurrence of AF.<sup>113</sup> A large international survey assessing global outcomes from AF, including over 20,000 ablations performed between 2003 and 2006, found that a median of 70% of patients became asymptomatic without antiarrhythmic drugs, and another 10% became asymptomatic in the presence of previously ineffective antiarrhythmic drugs over an average of 18 months of follow-up. Success rates were significantly greater for patients with paroxysmal AF (75% without antiarrhythmic drugs) than in patients with persistent or longstanding AF (63-65% without antiarrhythmic drugs).<sup>26</sup> A second ablation procedure is often required to achieve the quoted freedom from arrhythmia in up to 30% of patients, either from recurrent AF or due to post-ablation atrial tachycardias.26 Most patients with arrhythmia recurrence demonstrate recovered electrical conduction into the PVs at the time of redo procedures, demonstrating the difficulty achieving durable transmural ablation lesions. Furthermore, since arrhythmias can recur asymptomatically and sporadically, it is likely that the published rates of ablation success are an underestimation of the actual rate of AF recurrence.

As AF has been associated with increased mortality in various populations, it is possible that ablation will have a positive effect on mortality, though this has not yet been proven. Trials to assess the late success and long-term outcomes of AF ablation with regard to mortality, stroke risk, and heart failure, such as the CABANA trial, are ongoing.<sup>31</sup>

Encouraging results for AF ablation, however, must be tempered by the rare but significant risks involved. In the worldwide survey of AF, major complications occurred in 4.5% of procedures, including cardiac tamponade, PV stenosis, diaphragmatic paralysis, thromboembolism, atrioesophageal fistula, pneumothorax or hemothorax, vascular complications, valve damage, and congestive heart failure; procedure-related death occurred in 0.15%. <sup>26</sup> Interestingly, the rate of major adverse effects from antiarrhythmic drug treatment (including life-threatening arrhythmias and disabling drug intolerance) has been higher than ablation-related complications in various comparisons. <sup>111,114</sup>

Increasing acknowledgement of the risks associated with RF ablation have led to interest in alternate approaches to PVI, with the intent of improving the permanency of lesion formation and avoiding collateral damage to extracardiac structures. One such approach may be through the use of energy-delivering balloons, which can be placed within the orifice of a PV with the goal of creating circumferential lesions around the vein ostia. Most notably, the Cryoballoon (Arctic Frost, Medtronic CryoCath, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) using cryothermal energy from a balloon-tipped catheter has been used with success for treatment of paroxysmal AF.<sup>115</sup> Though the Cryoballoon provides a relatively simple alternative to point-by-point RF ablation delivery and may be associated with a lower rate of cardiac perforation, with increasing experience with this tool various complications have been reported including atrioesophageal fistulas, and a higher rate of phrenic nerve palsy. 116 Initial enthusiasm for an

endocardial deflectable catheter-based high-intensity focused ultrasound balloon (ProRhythm, Ronkonkoma, NY), allowing for the development of transmural linear lesions without direct tissue contact was dampened by low clinical success, and significant morbidity and mortality. 117,118 Using endoscopic visualization, laser balloon ablation (CardioFocus, Marlborough, MA) has also demonstrated promising initial results. 119

In elderly patients or those with severe comorbidities in whom standard treatment modalities cannot be achieved or are contraindicated, permanent rate control may be achieved through AV junction ablation and permanent pacemaker implantation, eliminating the need for aggressive pharmacologic treatment. The "Ablate and Pace" strategy is highly effective, relatively simple to perform, has been shown to improve quality of life in highly symptomatic patients, and may improve cardiac symptoms and decrease healthcare utilization when pharmacologic therapy is limited by hypotension or intolerable side effects. 120 Cessation of previously needed rate control and antiarrhythmic medications, often used in high-doses, after this procedure also generally results in immediate symptomatic improvement. This strategy is potentially problematic for many patients though, as it mandates continued anticoagulation, creates pacemaker dependence and tolerates permanent AV dyssynchrony. Patients dependent on the atrial contribution to diastole, such as those with diastolic dysfunction, may not symptomatically improve with this strategy. An additional limitation of this strategy is that right ventricular pacing promotes interventricular dyssynchrony, and may result in worsened LV function. The PAVE trial found that biventricular pacing after AV node ablation can result in better performance status (31 vs 24% above baseline in the 6-min walk test) and LV function (LV ejection fraction 46 vs 41%) at 6 months compared to right ventricular pacing.<sup>121</sup> This improvement with cardiac resynchronization may be even more pronounced in patients with preexisting systolic dysfunction. In a retrospective study comparing PV antral isolation versus AV node ablation and pacemaker implantation, the ablate and pace strategy was associated with a shorter procedure time with fewer complications, although there was higher rate of heart failure and continued, albeit asymptomatic, AF. 122

A more complex technique known as AV node modification attempts to ablate certain inputs to the AV node thus slowing the ventricular rate without requiring concomitant pacemaker implantation. This procedure has not been widely implemented because of the risk of inadvertent complete AV block, and a tendency for the ventricular rate to rise again in the post-ablation period.

## Ventricular Tachycardia

Catheter ablation also has an important role in the treatment and prevention of VT. Greater than 90% of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias originate in myocardium with structural abnormalities, most commonly ischemic heart disease. In these cases, regions of scarred myocardium create channels

of viable tissue that support re-entrant circuits; these circuits may be mapped and targeted with ablation. Patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy generally also have scarrelated circuits related to myocardial fibrosis, however, these scars are often multifocal and located in the epicardium or midmyocardium, complicating endocardial ablation. Initial experience with surgical endocardial resection and direct surgical ablation to eliminate VT led to advancements in catheter-based ablation techniques. In patients with extensive structural abnormalities, multiple VT circuits are often present, and thus even after successful VT ablation primary therapy remains implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) for prevention of sudden death. However, VT ablation is an important adjunct to reduce the arrhythmia burden and ICD shocks. According to the 2006 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines on management of ventricular arrhythmias, VT ablation has a class I indication as an adjunctive therapy in patients with an ICD who have received multiple shocks for sustained VT that is not manageable by device reprogramming of drug therapy. 124

Ablation for VT can be performed during ongoing VT, using activation and entrainment mapping to localize the

critical isthmus supporting the re-entrant circuit, or by identifying arrhythmogenic substrate during sinus rhythm. In "substrate mapping," intracardiac electrodes are used to identify regions with abnormal myocardial substrate that represent areas of slow conduction within the region of scar that may support VT. Determination of scarred myocardium requires the use of an electroanatomic mapping system, in which the amplitude of electrograms recorded at various sites are recorded, and area with low amplitude electrograms are represented as regions of scar on a color-coded three-dimensional map. Pace-mapping allows identification of VT exit or isthmus sites by matching the QRS morphology produced by pacing during sinus rhythm to the VT morphology; pacing can also identify areas with delayed conduction that may occur when pacing from within a protected channel, such as within the VT isthmus. Ablation is performed generally within the scar at sites thought to be critical for supporting re-entrant circuits (Fig. 53-8).<sup>125</sup>

In experienced centers, epicardial mapping and ablation is also commonly performed when the VT substrate cannot be eradicated by endocardial ablation. Access to the pericardium is achieved via pericardial puncture from a subxiphoid

An extensive region of low voltage representing scarred myocardium is present in the left ventricular outflow tract region. (B) Two morphologies of ventricular tachycardia were induced. (C) Pace mapping from different sites within the scar are shown. A good pace map for VT1 is observed with pacing at sites 2 and 3. A long delay between the pacing stimulus and the QRS occurs with pacing from site 1, demonstrating slow conduction away from the pacing site. A series of radiofrequency ablation lesions (red dots in panel A) across this region abolished both VT morphologies.

approach, and is often not possible in patients who have had prior cardiac surgery, particularly prior coronary artery bypass surgeries. <sup>126</sup> Epicardial ablation is more likely to be required in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, and in patients who have failed initial attempts at endocardial ablation.

In large trials, success of VT ablation in patients with structural heart disease is promising, but recurrences are common. Acute procedural success is usually defined as noninducibility of any VT after ablation, while partial short-term success is defined as ablation of the clinical VT only. The Multicenter Thermacool Ventricular Tachycardia Ablation trial evaluated 231 patients with recurrent monomorphic VT, including 69% of patients with hemodynamically poorly tolerated VT, and a median of three VTs per patient; ablation acutely abolished all inducible VTs in 49% of patients, while at 6 months 53% of patients were VT-free. 127 Furthermore, ablation success is dependent on the underlying myocardial substrate and patient population. A recent prospective evaluation reported a VT-free survival at 1 year of 57% for patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, and 40.5% for patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, despite complete acute procedural success achieved in 77% of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, and 67% of patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. 128 While VT is not completely abolished in all patients, the frequency of VT recurrences and associated ICD shocks may be dramatically reduced, resulting is a substantial improvement in an individual's quality of life, even when VT is not completely eradicated. In the Thermacool VT Ablation trial, among patients with at least 6 months of follow-up, VT episodes were reduced from a median of 11.5 episodes preablation, to a median of 0 postablation, and the frequency of VT was reduced by ≥75% in two-thirds of patients. 127 Complications from VT ablation include stroke, cardiac tamponade, valve damage, heart failure, AV block, vascular complications, and death. Procedure-related deaths have been reported in up to 3%, and most commonly occurs as a result of progressive ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest after failed ablation. In the Thermacool study, death occurred in the electrophysiology laboratory in 4 of 231 patients. Nonfatal complications have been reported in approximately 7%. 127,129-131

Bundle branch reentry VT is another type of VT that may occur in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and His-Purkinje system disease. In bundle branch reentry, a macro re-entrant circuit using the conduction system occurs, most commonly with propagation antegrade down the right bundle branch and retrograde up the left bundle branch, resulting in a wide complex tachycardia with a left bundle branch block pattern. Patients typically present with palpitation, syncope, or sudden death. Treatment involves ablation of the right bundle branch to interrupt the re-entrant circuit. Long-term success is good for prevention of recurrent bundle branch reentry, however, as these patients generally have extensive ventricular structural abnormalities, other VTs may develop, and ICDs are still required even after successful ablation. In addition to other established risks of ablation, ablation within the specialized conduction system poses a risk of ablation-related heart block. 132,133

Other cardiac disorders associated with sustained monomorphic VT include right ventricular dysplasia, <sup>134</sup> infiltrative disorders such as cardiac sarcoidosis <sup>135,136</sup> and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. <sup>137</sup> Patients with prior ventricular surgery can develop incision-related VT, commonly seen in patients who have undergone repair of congenital cardiac abnormalities such as tetralogy of Fallot, <sup>138</sup> or after corrective valve surgery. <sup>139</sup>

VT that presents in patients without structural heart disease is termed idiopathic and represents up to 10% of all VTs that present to tertiary referral centers. In these patients, VT ablation may be curative, and long-term prognosis after ablation is good even without ICDs. Patients may be asymptomatic or present with palpitation, dizziness, or syncope. Patients may present with frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), nonsustained VT, or even sustained VT. In patients with a high PVC burden (>20,000 in 24 h) a myopathy may develop that is treatable by elimination of the ventricular ectopy. Idiopathic outflow tract arrhythmias typically have a left bundle branch QRS morphology with an inferior axis; though classically described as originating in the right ventricular outflow tract, PVCs, or VT may be mapped and successfully ablated anywhere in the base of the heart, including in the regions of the aortic valve cusps or along the mitral annulus. These occur more often in women than in men, and patients typically present in their thirties to fifties.140 While they may be responsive to medical management with beta blockers or other medications such as flecainde (if there is no underlying cardiomyopathy) they are certainly amenable to ablation. One of the biggest reasons for failure is the lack of target PVCs/tachycardia at the time of ablation.

Other idiopathic VTs may be focal or involve a micro reentrant circuit, often using branches of the Purkinje system. Fascicular VT most often originates from the left posterior fascicle, producing a right bundle branch VT morphology with rightward, superior axis. These VTs occurs more often in men, and are classically sensitive to verapamil. Success rates for ablation of idiopathic VT are in the range of 70 to 90% with recurrence rates in the range of 15%. Complication rates are consistent with those of other ablative procedures. <sup>27,141</sup>

#### Cost-effectiveness

Several studies have shown the cost-effectiveness of catheter ablation compared with medical therapy and surgical ablation. Catheter ablation has lower procedural costs than surgical ablation and reduces the need for further medical care and emergency department visits in comparison to drug therapy. Studies from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and from Australia have shown both cost savings and improvement in quality of life for those undergoing catheter-based ablation compared to medical management. 142-146

As AF is the most common sustained arrhythmia and is associated with substantial healthcare costs related to hospitalizations and drug costs, the cost-effectiveness of catheter ablation for the treatment of AF has gained particular attention. AF ablation is associated with substantial upfront expenditures but greater efficacy in maintaining sinus

rhythm, and thus likely fewer subsequent cardioversions and hospitalization costs. Initial ablation costs have been estimated at approximately \$15,000, with follow-up costs after ablation ranging from \$200 to \$1300 annually, compared to approximately \$4000 annually for patients treated with antiarrhythmic medications; total costs of the two strategies appear to converge after about 5 years of follow-up. 147 Another analysis suggested that the cost-effectiveness of a rhythm-control strategy with ablation would be most costeffective in younger patients and patients with at least moderate risk of stroke. 148 One study performed in the United Kingdom demonstrated cost savings for ablation in combination with antiarrhythmic drug therapy compared to drug therapy alone, in large part driven by reduction in healthcare utilization rather than the mere cost of the drug itself. 149 Essentially all cost-effectiveness analyses of AF ablation thus far have calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios close to the value of \$50,000 per quality-adjusted life year that is typically considered acceptable in the United States. 147 The cost-effectiveness calculations for ablation, however, will continue to be unreliable until the long-term outcomes of ablation with regard to mortality and morbidity are clarified. In addition the value of this procedure will continue to evolve along with the procedure itself. The development of a more reliably successful ablation procedure that only requires a single attempt would dramatically increase cost effectiveness.

#### **FUTURE DIRECTIONS**

Catheter ablation is a relatively young field and has undergone dramatic advances over the past three decades. Technologic developments focused on improving the safety and efficacy of targeted catheter ablation, using minimally invasive methods, have lead the way to a revolution in the treatment of arrhythmias. Mapping systems are rapidly evolving to provide more accurate reconstructions of intracardiac geometry and electrical activation. Integration of ICE, MRI, and CT images, fluoroscopy, and cineangiographic sequences into electroanatomic maps can support understanding of complex anatomy, and allow contextual visualization of the movement of intracardiac catheters, while minimizing fluoroscopic exposure to the operator. 150 Noncontact mapping systems are also in development to quickly reproduce cardiac activation sequences without tedious point-by-point electrogram acquisition. 151 For patients with AF, ablation techniques beyond targeting PV triggers are of great interest. Methods of mapping AF-sustaining substrate in the atria, such as electrical rotors, have been developed that use intracardiac catheters to reconstruct three-dimensional maps of AF propagation; early studies suggest that ablation targeting this substrate in addition to conventional triggers improves long-term freedom from arrhythmia. 152 Developing technology and techniques are also focusing on novel methods to more effectively and safely deliver durable ablation lesions. The recent approval of force sensing catheters in the United States has the potential to revolutionize the industry; real-time feedback of force application within the cardiac chamber during mapping and ablation supports improved ablation delivery, lesion creation, and safety. Multicenter experience using force sensing catheter for ablation of AF have shown promise that this technology will improve outcomes. Is Integration of careful impedance monitoring into electroanatomic mapping systems provides additional feedback of local heating and lesion application. Is New techniques are also focusing on novel methods to deliver ablation deep into tissues. Ablation of VT is sometimes limited by inability to reach arrhythmogenic substrate deep within the myocardium, such as within the interventricular septum. A novel needle-tipped ablation catheter, capable of mapping and delivering RF energy from a retractable needle, is undergoing clinical trials, and holds promise to improve ablation of deep intramyocardial substrate not reachable by traditional endocardial ablation.

Remote navigation systems have been developed and are now in use to support catheter ablation of various arrhythmias. Though these tools have not replaced the value of a human operator, but do reduce operator exposure to fluoroscopy and may shorten procedural times. 156-160 The Niobe system (Stereotaxis, Inc., St. Louis, MO) is a remote magnetic navigation system that uses two externally located magnets to create a steerable field that can be used to steer the magnetically active atraumatic catheter tip (Magnetic GentleTouch Catheters, Stereotaxis). The unit can be completely controlled remotely through a small motor, and the entire system can be controlled from a shielded room by joystick and touch-screen monitors using a hands-free robotic catheter control.  $^{\rm 161}$  Another robotic catheter system, Sensei (Hansen Medical, Mountain View, CA) allows catheter manipulation from a control room using a mechanical steering outer sheath through which a conventional catheter is inserted. 162 Clinical results from remote navigation for AF ablation have yet to demonstrate superiority over manual operation and frequently require crossover to manual ablation. In addition the cost of the equipment greatly reduces the cost effectiveness of the procedure.

As the left atrial appendage is the most important source of thrombi in patients with non-valvular AF, 163 percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion devices have been developed to reduce stroke risk in patients with AF and elevated bleeding risks that preclude systemic anticoagulation. The Watchman device is nearing FDA approval. In the Watchman Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic Protection in Patients with AF (PROTECT AF) trial, the Watchman occlusion device percutaneously implanted at the ostium of the left atrial appendage compared favorably to warfarin with regard to the composite endpoint of stroke, cardiovascular or unexplained death, or systemic embolism at a mean follow-up of 18 months.164 With extended follow-up, it appears that most complications associated with the device occur in the early post-procedure period and decline with operator experience. Other methods of left atrial appendage closure, such as epicardial suture ligation have also been used. The lariat device is delivered via subxiphoid epicardial access, and has been used with success in various centers.

The past 40 years have seen the development of intracardiac recording, programmed stimulation, and catheter ablation. Though rapidly expanding, the field of interventional electrophysiology is still young. Tremendous advances in technology and understanding of arrhythmia mechanisms have resulted in improvement in the care, and in many cases cure, or formerly intractable arrhythmias. Similar advances have allowed these minimally invasive procedures to be performed with impressive safety. Further improvements in the interventional treatment of complex arrhythmias such as AF and VT will come with further understanding of the mechanisms underlying these arrhythmias. Future innovations in catheter design, energy delivery, and imaging techniques will continue to advance the field of electrophysiology.
