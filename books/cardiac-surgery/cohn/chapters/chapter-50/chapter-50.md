### Endovascular Therapy for the Treatment of Thoracic Aortic Disease

Susan D. Moffatt-Bruce • R. Scott Mitchell

Patients with thoracic aortic disease pose many challenges. Frequently, these patients are older and present with multiple comorbidities. Additionally, the posterior location of the descending thoracic aorta requires a large thoracotomy incision, with its own inherent morbidity.

The modern surgical treatment of thoracic aortic disease began in the 1950s, when successful treatment utilizing segmental resection and graft replacement was first reported by Swan, Lam, DeBakey, and Etheridge. 1-3 Soon thereafter, DeBakey and Cooley reported the first successful repair of an ascending aortic aneurysm using cardiopulmonary bypass.<sup>4</sup> Cardiopulmonary bypass and commercially available tube grafts were the mainstays of our surgical armamentarium for the next 30 years. Improved diagnostic capabilities, surgical techniques, and perioperative care have resulted in improved outcomes, even as the risk profile has worsened.<sup>5,6</sup> In an effort to limit the morbidity of these operations, 7,8 endovascular techniques emerged as an attractive alternative. Originally devised for high-risk patients, and following on developments directed toward aneurysms of the abdominal aorta, thoracic endovascular stent-graft technology has rapidly evolved. Although originally intended for repair of atherosclerotic thoracic aortic aneurysms,9-11 thoracic stent-graft applications have been expanded to the treatment of multiple pathologies, including acute and chronic aortic dissections, penetrating atherosclerotic aortic ulcers, and thoracic aortic trauma. 12-19 Results have steadily improved, and long-term durability has been encouraging; however, the necessity for long-term follow-up remains, 20-22 with obvious financial implications.

#### **HISTORY**

Endovascular stent-graft technology, initially targeting the abdominal aortic aneurysm, was introduced by Parodi.<sup>23</sup> Balloon-expandable stents, sewn inside the ends of a vascular tube graft, were placed within the aneurysmal aorta, excluding the aneurysm sac. Simultaneously, at Stanford University

Medical Center, a collaborative effort between interventional radiologists and cardiovascular surgeons proved highly synergistic and resulted in a homemade thoracic stent graft.

Self-expanding Gianturco Z stents (Cook Company, Bloomington, IN) were fastened together and covered with a woven Dacron graft (Meadox-Boston Scientific, Natick, MA; Fig. 50-1), and then compressed into a 28-French introducer sheath. The first homemade thoracic graft was implanted in the descending thoracic aorta in 1992 after Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was obtained. Subsequently, a high-risk trial was approved for patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms who were deemed nonsurgical candidates. Thirteen such patients were treated utilizing stent grafts, customized-designed for each patient. Placement of these stents was successful in all patients, with complete thrombosis of the aneurysm sac reported in 12 of the 13 patients. At 1 year, there were no deaths, paraplegia, strokes, or distal embolization.

Feasibility having been established, IRB approval was obtained for a subsequent trial of 103 patients, 60% of whom were deemed unfit for conventional open surgical repair.<sup>25</sup> Using the same "homemade" first-generation stent graft, complete aneurysm thrombosis was achieved in 83% of patients. Thirty-day mortality was 9% and was significantly associated with a history of cerebral vascular accidents and myocardial infarctions. Major perioperative morbidities included paraplegia in three patients, cerebrovascular accidents in seven patients, and respiratory insufficiency in 12 patients. Actuarial survival was 81% at 1 year and 73% at 2 years. Given the high-risk nature of this patient population, these firstgeneration results were deemed satisfactory. It was, however, recognized that mortality and morbidity occurred frequently and that long-term follow-up was necessary to establish the long-term efficacy. Subsequently, in 2004, mid-term results were reported for these initial 103 patients treated with first-generation stent grafts.<sup>26</sup> Overall actuarial survival was dismal; 82, 49, and 27% at 1, 5, and 8 years, respectively.

However, for potentially operable candidates, survival was 93 and 78% at 1 and 5 years, respectively, as contrasted to a 74 and 31% survival at 1 and 5 years, respectively, in those patients deemed inoperable. Late rupture in 11 patients reinforced the mandate for continued lifelong follow-up.

This technology was extended to the treatment of complicated acute type B aortic dissections, as reported by Dake and associates in the *New England Journal of Medicine* in 1999.<sup>27</sup> Again, utilizing these first-generation homemade devices, stent grafts were placed across the primary entry tear, successfully excluding false lumen perfusion. Distal malperfusion was corrected, and false lumen thrombosis within the chest occurred in 79% of patients. Early mortality was 16%, which largely reflected very late referral. Favorable clinical results persisted out to a mean follow-up of 13 months.

#### **TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENT**

Homemade stent-graft devices persisted for another 10 years, as commercial development was slow to evolve. Homemade devices were made in 10, 15, and 20 cm lengths, with diameters from 23 to 36 mm. Two-centimeter proximal and distal landing zones were recommended, and stent grafts were oversized to approximately 10 to 15%. These grafts were then loaded into 28-French delivery sheaths, which were advanced into the descending thoracic aorta, usually through a femoral artery cutdown. In addition to small iliofemoral vessels, additional anatomic constraints of these early first-generation stent grafts, which precluded either delivery or secure fixation, included acute angulation of the distal arch, a severe sigmoid-like tortuosity through the diaphragmatic crura, and excessive mural thrombus.

**FIGURE 50-2** Second-generation commercially manufactured thoracic aortic stent graft. The thoracic Excluder TAG system by W.L. Gore contains a thin-walled PTFE graft covered by a nitinol exoskeleton.

The advent of this new stent-graft technology required a new terminology for endoleaks, which allowed the aneurysmal sac to remain pressurized. Type I endoleaks occur at the proximal (A) or distal (B) attachment sites and signify a failure to achieve a hemostatic seal at these implant sites. Type II endoleaks denote a communication between a branch vessel and the excluded aneurysm sac, and are commonly seen with back-bleeding intercostal vessels. Type III endoleaks occur at graft to graft junctions, and Type IV endoleaks are characterized by increase in aneurysm sac size in the absence of an identifiable endoleak, variously referred to as endotension.

In 2005 and 2006, commercially produced stent grafts became available. Initially, the Gore Excluder TAG system (W.L. Gore, Sunnyvale, CA) was approved (Fig. 50-2), followed shortly thereafter by the Medtronic Talent Graft (Medtronic, Sunrise, FL) and the Cook Zenith (Cook Company, Bloomington, IN). These second- and third-generation endoprostheses addressed many of the deficiencies of the early homemade devices. The delivery systems have become increasingly smaller in diameter and more flexible. The exoskeleton has to provide high column strength and ductility and be compression- and kink-resistant. Nitinol is used predominantly, covered by either Dacron or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft material.

#### **EARLY RESULTS**

In January 2005, the phase II multicenter trial of the Gore Excluder TAG thoracic endoprosthesis was reported.<sup>28</sup> This multicenter, prospective, nonrandomized trial was conducted at 17 sites and compared the results of stent-graft repair of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms in 140 patients, with the results of open repair in 94 patients. Strict inclusion and

exclusion criteria were defined in an attempt to ensure comparability of both groups. Follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months. For stent-graft patients, operative blood loss, renal failure, paraplegia, and mortality rates were all significantly less than for the open repair group (Fig. 50-3). Interestingly, stroke rates were approximately equal in both groups. ICU stay and total hospital stay and time to return to normal activity were approximately 50% shorter for the stent-graft group than for those with open repair. Although stent-graft patients had reduced aneurysm-related mortality out to 2 years (3% vs 10%), interestingly, all-cause mortality was similar between groups at 2 years, similar to the results of recent randomized trials in abdominal aortic aneurysm stent grafts.

#### THORACIC AORTIC ANEURYSMS

Approximately 50% of all thoracic aortic aneurysms are located in the descending aorta; these aneurysms commonly arise at the level of the left subclavian artery and are often atherosclerotic in nature.<sup>29</sup> The size–rupture correlation has been demonstrated through the natural history of these aneurysms, as reported by Clouse and associates, using the Olmstead County database, in which thoracic aortic aneurysms have an overall 5-year rupture risk of 30%.30 The Mount Sinai group has identified clinical variables that predict the risk for rupture, including increasing age, presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, maximal thoracic and abdominal aneurysm diameter, and presence of pain.<sup>31</sup> The Yale Aortic Diseases Group has documented rupture and dissection of thoracic aortic aneurysms at a median diameter of 7.2 cm.6 The Yale Group also reported the mean rate of rupture or dissection as 2% per year for smaller aneurysms, 3% for aneurysms 5.0 to 5.9 cm, and 6.9% for aneurysms 6.0 cm and larger.<sup>32</sup> Open surgical graft replacement has been the traditional mainstay of treatment for these patients, and mortality rates of 5 to 10 % have been reported from experienced centers. 33,34 Similarly,

paraplegia rates have decreased to the 3 to 8% range, with increasing risk associated with increased extent of resection, emergency operation, and renal dysfunction. Utilization of distal circulatory support and cerebral spinal fluid drainage was protective. 35-38 However, in an ever-increasingly elderly population with multiple comorbidities, endovascular repair has become increasingly attractive, especially for patients with favorable anatomy.

Technological progress has also been very enabling. Smaller and more flexible delivery systems have assured access in most patients. Coverage of the left subclavian artery to create a satisfactory proximal landing zone has been frequently employed with few complications. Preoperative left subclavian-to-carotid transposition needs to be entertained only for extensive thoracic coverage, diminutive right vertebral artery, impaired perfusion of both left subclavian and hypogastric arteries, and for patients with previously repaired abdominal aortic aneurysms. Patients considered at high risk for paraplegia should receive a spinal drain preoperatively and hypotension assiduously avoided. Increasingly, percutaneous access is sufficient, even in obese patients. Lastly, much like abdominal aortic aneurysms, endograft technology can be very efficient for the management of ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysms.

#### THORACIC AORTIC DISSECTION

Perhaps the greatest impact of this endovascular technology has been on the treatment of thoracic aortic dissections. Previously, open repair of complicated acute type B aortic dissections, defined as those dissections with rupture or impending rupture, rapid expansion, or malperfusion syndromes, was associated with high mortalities. Endovascular repair, because of its ability to cover the primary entry tear, thus redirecting flow into the true lumen and eliminating "dynamic malperfusion"; also allows treatment of "static malperfusion" during the same interventional setting.

Uncovered stents placed in branch vessel orifices occluded by an intimal flap are remarkably effective for these malperfused organ systems.<sup>39,42</sup>

For uncomplicated acute type B aortic dissections, there is increasing enthusiasm for prophylactic placement of stent grafts to allow aortic remodeling during the acute and subacute phases. Conventional medical therapy successes may still fail in the late follow-up due to aneurysmal expansion of the false lumen. Early stent-graft intervention, if it could be achieved with low morbidity and mortality, could allow positive aortic remodeling in the stented aorta, avoiding these very problematic late aneurysmal complications. Given the likely development of disease-specific stents, ideally, a covered segment in the proximal portions and uncovered stents for the more distal aorta, prophylactic stent grafting in the subacute stage could allow positive aortic remodeling for the entire thoracic aorta (Fig. 50-4).<sup>27</sup> Hopefully, genetic risk factors which place patients at increased risk for late aneurysmal changes could be identified, which would allow targeting those patients who would most benefit from such a prophylactic intervention.

Chronic aortic dissections are more problematic. Frequently, these patients are much older, with very large aneurysmal components, and multiple communications between true and false lumens. Open surgical repair has been associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, since the dissection frequently extends into the abdomen, and because of multiple fenestrations between the true and false lumens, exclusion of false lumen filling is difficult. Although aneurysmal dilation frequently involves only the proximal descending thoracic aorta, it is unknown whether endograft coverage of the entire thoracic aorta to the level of the celiac artery will be sufficient to provoke false lumen thrombosis. Recent publication of a select series by Hughes and the Duke aortic group has documented good results with low morbidity by stent grafting from the left subclavian artery to the celiac axis. 43 Complete exclusion of a patent false lumen distally, especially in the absence of multibranch grafts, can be very problematic, even with snorkel and chimney grafts and occluder devices. New technical advances should provide more tools to address these very problematic patients. Roselli and the Cleveland Clinic group recently reported surgical

and endovascular experience in this very challenging group of patients, highlighting the competing risks of death and intervention.<sup>44</sup>

# PENETRATING ATHEROSCLEROTIC ULCERS AND INTRAMURAL HEMATOMAS

Intramural hematoma (IMH) of the aorta is attracting growing interest as a variant of aortic dissection. <sup>45</sup> The exact pathophysiology is not well understood. Although by definition, pure IMH likely occurs from hemorrhage into the media from the vasa vasorum, many maintain that an intimal disruption is present in all cases.

Certainly, in the absence of any intimal disruption, there would be no indication for stent-graft repair. IMH, however, is often associated with or even precipitated by penetrating atherosclerotic ulcers (PAUs) of the descending thoracic aorta. Therefore, covering the PAU with a stent graft may limit the progression of the IMH and allow healing to occur. 46-48 Unfortunately, even with successful stent-graft implantation using both first- and second-generation grafts, retrograde aortic dissection, new ulcer formation, and endoleaks have been noted in a significant percentage of patients, emphasizing the diffuse and severe nature of this disease. 49-52

The Stanford group has reported their mid-term results treating PAU of the descending thoracic aorta, with an average of 51 months of follow-up<sup>19</sup> (Fig. 50-5). Using both

first- and second-generation commercial devices, 26 patients were treated, 14 of whom were deemed nonoperative candidates. The primary success rate was 92%, with actuarial survival estimates of 85, 76, and 70% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Perioperative mortality was 12%. Increasing aortic diameter and female gender were determinants of treatment failure. These risk factors reflect the importance of careful patient selection based on anatomical criteria and clinical factors. In addition, long-term follow-up with serial CT angiography is necessary to detect late complications.

#### THORACIC AORTIC TRAUMA

Aortic injuries secondary to nonpenetrating trauma are frequently lethal lesions, with 80 to 90% of patients dying in the hour after the accident. Urgent surgical graft replacement of the aorta has been the conventional treatment, but these patients frequently have other major injuries, including closed head injuries, pulmonary contusions, myocardial contusions, and other solid organ injuries, which may limit options for surgical repair. Thoracic endografts would appear to be an invaluable addition to our surgical armamentarium. Initially, however, all available stent grafts were too large to be utilized inside the smaller aortas of these younger patients. Fortunately, smaller stent grafts, as well as tapered stent grafts, have become available, greatly facilitating repair of these traumatic injuries. S4-58

Blunt aortic injuries have been classified in an SVS classification system. Class I injury involves only an intimal laceration with no other radiographic changes. Type II injury includes an intimal laceration and mild intramural hemorrhage without significant compromise of the vessel lumen or expansion of the adventitial diameter. Extent III denotes an intramural hemorrhage, sufficient to cause an increase in aortic diameter and compression of the intimal lumen, the classical pseudo-aneurysm. Class IV denotes rupture or impending rupture. For Class I and II injuries, most authors recommend no acute treatment, with repeat imaging in 24 to 48 hours. When anatomically feasible, stent-graft coverage for Class III and IV injuries has become the procedure of choice, limiting stent-graft length to that necessary to cover the injured area. Endografts longer than 15 cm may be associated with an increased risk of paraplegia. For type II injuries noted to progress and for type III injuries, delayed repair may be elected in a stable patient to allow recovery from other injuries. With an Extent III injury and with the necessity for permissive hypertension in the treatment of a closed head injury, early intervention may be warranted (Fig. 50-6). In patients for whom permissive hypertension is desirable, that is, patients with closed head injuries, early stent-graft placement may be indicated. Otherwise, for stable type III or minimally progressive Extent II injuries, delayed stent-graft placement may be most effective, allowing interval recovery from polytrauma. There is little data demonstrating the durability of these stent grafts in past 5 years, but it is expected that interval surveillance will allow safe and timely reintervention if necessary.

#### **FUTURE DIRECTIONS**

Despite the many advances in the field of endovascular surgery, stent grafting of the thoracic aorta remains in a developmental phase. Possible in the United States, especially compared to China and Japan. Unibranch grafts may allow more proximal repairs into the aortic arch, and multibranch and fenestrated grafts may allow complex repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. There are currently many new stent-graft and interventional technologies in the pipeline, which will facilitate aortic repairs in the future. Disease-specific endografts and combinations will also likely become available, further enabling endovascular repair.

Finally, it is important that these patients be followed longitudinally. Early success is no long-term guarantee, as we have seen even totally thrombosed aortic aneurysm sacs elongate with a late appearance of type I endoleaks. Serial imaging may allow timely reintervention, but obviously does incur added expense.

Diseases of the thoracic aorta pose a significant challenge to the surgeon because of complexity of the disease and the characteristics of an ever-aging patient population. Current literature supports increasing application of endovascular technology in well-suited patients, but further follow-up and additional trials may be necessary to further refine the exact role of endovascular repair for the future.
