### THE NORMAL MITRAL VALVE

### **Anatomy**

The mitral annulus is a pliable zone of discontinuous fibrous and muscular tissue that joins the left atrium and left ventricle and anchors the hinge portions of the anterior and posterior mitral leaflets. The annulus has two major collagenous structures: (1) the right fibrous trigone, which is part of the central fibrous body and is located at the intersection of the membranous septum, the tricuspid annulus, and the aortic annulus; and (2) the left fibrous trigone, which is located near the aortic annulus under the left aortic cusp (Fig. 34-1). The anterior mitral leaflet is in direct fibrous continuity with the aortic annulus under the left and noncoronary aortic valve cusps. The posterior half to two-thirds of the annulus, which subtends the posterior leaflet, is primarily muscular with little or no fibrous tissue.<sup>2</sup>

The mitral valve has two major leaflets, the larger anterior (or aortic) leaflet and the smaller posterior (or mural) leaflet; the latter usually contains three or more scallops separated by fetal clefts or *subcommissures*.<sup>4</sup> The three posterior leaflet scallops are termed anterolateral (P1), middle (P2), and posteromedial (P3) scallops<sup>3</sup> (Fig. 34-2). The portions of the leaflets near the free margin on the atrial surface are called the *rough zone*, with the remainder of the leaflet surface closer to the annulus being termed the *smooth* (or *bare* or *membranous*) *zone*. The ratio of the height of the rough zone to the height of the clear zone is 0.6 for the anterior leaflet and 1.4 for the posterior leaflet because the clear zone on the posterior scallops occupies only about 2 mm.<sup>4</sup> The two leaflets are separated by the posteromedial and anterolateral commissures.

The histologic structure of the leaflets includes three layers: (1) the fibrosa, the solid collagenous core continuous with the chordae tendineae; (2) the spongiosa, which is on the atrial surface and forms the leaflet leading edge (it consists of few collagen fibers but has abundant proteoglycans, elastin, and mixed connective tissue cells); and (3) a thin fibroelastic covering of most of the leaflets.<sup>2</sup> On the atrial aspect of both leaflets, this surface (the atrialis) is rich in elastin. The ventricular side of the fibroelastic cover (the ventricularis) is much thicker and packed with elastin. The fibroelastic layers

become thickened with advancing age as a result of elaboration of more elastin and more collagen formation; accelerated similar changes also accompany progression of myxomatous (degenerative or "floppy") mitral valvular disease in young patients with Barlow syndrome. In addition to these connective tissue structures, mitral leaflets contain myocardium, smooth muscle, contractile valvular interstitial cells, and blood vessels, as well as both adrenergic and cholinergic afferent and efferent nerves.<sup>5-10</sup> Leaflet contractile tissue is neurally controlled and plays a role in mitral valve function. 11-14 The atrial surface of the anterior leaflet exhibits a depolarizing electrocardiogram spike shortly before the onset of the QRS complex, and the resulting contraction of leaflet muscle (which can be abolished by beta-blockade), along with contraction of smooth muscle and valvular interstitial cells, possibly aids leaflet coaptation before the onset of systole, as well as stiffens the leaflet in response to rising left ventricular (LV) pressure. 6-8,15-23

# Annular Size, Shape, and Dynamics

The average mitral annular cross-sectional area ranges from 5.0 to 11.4 cm<sup>2</sup> in normal human hearts (average is 7.6 cm<sup>2</sup>).<sup>24</sup> The posterior annulus circumscribes approximately two-thirds of the mitral annulus. Annular area varies during the cardiac cycle and is influenced directly by both left atrial (LA) and LV contraction, size, and pressure. 25,26 Varying by 20 to 40% during the cardiac cycle, annular size increases beginning in late systole and continues through isovolumic relaxation and into diastole; maximal annular area occurs in late diastole.<sup>25,27-29</sup> Importantly, half to two-thirds of the total decrease in annular area occurs during atrial contraction (or presystolic); this component of annular area change is smaller when the PR interval is short and is abolished when atrial fibrillation or ventricular pacing is present. Annular area decreases further (if LV end-diastolic volume is not abnormally elevated) to a minimum in early to midsystole. 25-27

The normal human mitral annulus is roughly elliptical, with greater eccentricity (ie, being less circular) in systole than in diastole. <sup>24-26,30</sup> In three-dimensional (3D) space, the annulus is saddle shaped (or a hyperbolic paraboloid), with

the highest point (farthest from the LV apex) located anteriorly in the middle of the anterior leaflet; this point is termed the *fibrosa* in the echocardiography literature and the *saddle horn* by surgeons. The low points are located posteromedially and anterolaterally in the commissures, and another less prominent high point is located directly posterior. <sup>25,31,32</sup> During the cardiac cycle, annular regions adjacent to the posterior leaflet move toward (during systole) and away (during diastole) from the relatively immobile anterior annulus. <sup>25</sup>

The mitral annulus moves upward into the left atrium in diastole and toward the LV apex during systole; the duration, average rate, and magnitude of annular displacement

correlate with (and perhaps influence) the rate of LA filling and emptying. <sup>25,27,28,33</sup> The annulus moves slightly during late diastole (2 to 4 mm toward the left atrium during atrial systole). This movement does not occur in the presence of atrial fibrillation. The annulus moves a greater distance (3 to 16 mm toward the LV apex) during isovolumic contraction and ventricular ejection. This systolic motion, which aids subsequent LA filling, is related to the extent of ventricular emptying and is likely driven by LV contraction. <sup>25,28,33,34</sup> Subsequently, the annulus moves very little during isovolumic relaxation but then exhibits rapid recoil toward the left atrium in early diastole. This recoiling increases the net velocity of mitral inflow by as much as 20%. <sup>28,35</sup> Annular motion can be responsible for up to 20% of LV filling and ejection. <sup>36</sup>

# **Dynamic Leaflet Motion**

The posterior mitral leaflet is attached to thinner chordae tendineae than the anterior leaflet, and its motion is restrained by chordae during both systole and diastole. 4,37 Regions of both leaflets are concave toward the left ventricle during systole, 38,39 but leaflet shape is complex, and anterior leaflet curvature near the annulus is convex to the left ventricle during systole, thus resulting in a sigmoid shape. <sup>29,31,32</sup> Leaflet opening does not start with the free margin but rather in the center of the leaflet; leaflet curvature flattens initially and then becomes reversed (making the leaflet convex toward the left ventricle) while the edges are still approximated.<sup>29,39</sup> The leading edge then moves into the left ventricle (like a traveling wave), and the leaflet straightens. The leaflet edges in the middle of the valve appear to separate before those portions closer to the commissures, and posterior leaflet opening occurs approximately 8 to 40 ms later.<sup>39,40</sup> Early leaflet opening (e wave) is very rapid; once reaching maximum opening, the edges exhibit a slow to-and-fro movement (like a flag flapping in a breeze) until another less forceful opening impulse occurs, associated with the a wave.

Valve closure starts with the leaflet bulging toward the atrium at its attachment point to the annulus. The closure rate of the anterior leaflet is almost twice that of the posterior leaflet, thereby ensuring arrival of both cusps at their closed positions simultaneously (because the anterior leaflet is opened more widely than the posterior leaflet at the onset of ventricular systole). The anterior leaflet actually arrives at the plane of the annulus in a bulged shape (concave to the ventricle), but as the closing movement proceeds and the leaflet ascends toward the atrium, this curvature appears to run through the whole leaflet, from the annulus toward the edge, in a rolling manner. The leaflet edge is the last part of the leaflet to approach the annular plane.

# Chordae Tendinae and Papillary Muscles

Epicardial fibers in the left ventricle descend from the base of the heart and proceed inward at the apex to form the two papillary muscles, which are characterized by vertically oriented myocardial fibers. 41,42 The anterolateral papillary muscle usually has one major head and is a more prominent structure; the posteromedial papillary muscle can have two or more subheads and is flatter. The posteromedial papillary muscle usually is supplied by the right coronary artery (or a dominant left circumflex artery in 10% of patients); the anterolateral papillary muscle is supplied by blood flow from

both the left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries.<sup>3,41,43</sup>

The posteromedial and anterolateral papillary muscles give rise to chordae tendineae going to both leaflets<sup>4,44</sup> (Fig. 34-3). Classically, the chordae are divided functionally into three groups. 41,45 First-order chordae originate near the papillary muscle tips, divide progressively, and insert on the leading edge of the leaflets; these primary chordae prevent valve-edge prolapse during systole. The second-order chordae (including two or more larger and less branched "strut" chordae) originate from the same location and tend to be thicker and fewer in number. 4,45 They insert on the ventricular surface of the leaflets at the junction of the rough and clear zones, which is demarcated by a subtle ridge on the leaflet corresponding to the line of leaflet coaptation. The second-order chordae (including the strut chordae) serve to anchor the valve, are more prominent on the anterior leaflet, and are important for optimal ventricular systolic function. Second-order chordae may arborize from large chordae that also give rise to firstorder chordae. The third-order chordae, also called *tertiary* or basal chordae, originate directly from the trabeculae carneae of the ventricular wall, attach to the posterior leaflet near the annulus, and can be identified by their fan-shaped patterns. 45 Additionally, distinct commissural chordae and cleft chordae exist in the commissures. In total, about 25 major chordal trunks (range 15 to 32) arise from the papillary muscles in

humans, equally divided between those going to the anterior and posterior leaflets; on the other end, greater than 100 smaller individual chordae attach to the leaflets.  $^{45}$ 

During diastole, the papillary muscles form an inflow tract. During systole, they create an outflow tract that later becomes obliterated owing to systolic thickening of the papillary muscles, thereby augmenting LV ejection by volume displacement. 42 The contribution of the papillary muscles to LV chamber volume is 5 to 8% during diastole but 15 to 30% during systole. 42,46 The anterolateral and posteromedial papillary muscles contract simultaneously and are innervated by both sympathetic and parasympathetic (vagal) nerves. 47,48 Excited synchronously with adjacent endocardium, the papillary muscles develop tension that significantly lags LV pressure and change length in concert with LV volume<sup>49-51</sup> (Fig. 34-4). At end of isovolumic contraction, therefore, very little papillary tension and/or contraction is available to hold the closed leaflets in place against systolic LV pressure. This has led to the suggestion that the leaflets in the closed valve are virtually self-supporting, which, in turn, has led to the following hypotheses<sup>51</sup>: (1) The chordae, having precise lengths and anchored by papillary tips that maintain a fixed geometric relationship to the mitral annulus, guide the leaflets into precise geometric shapes and positions at the moment of valve closure. If these initial geometric conditions are set properly at this instant (ie, the complex leaflet curvatures are set precisely and all leaflet edges are positioned precisely with respect to one another in the LV chamber), the resulting leaflet assemblage becomes a near-rigid body whose geometry is virtually independent of flow and pressure throughout systole. (2) Subsequent papillary force development, transmitted through secondary chords, contributes about 10% to the total force of LV contraction, particularly in mid-to-late systole. This may underlie the findings, originally by Lillehei and colleagues<sup>52</sup> but validated many times since, that clinical

outcomes are improved by chordal preservation during mitral valve replacement. (3) Papillary muscle force and shortening, continuing during and after ventricular relaxation, plays an active role in valve opening. (4) Anterior leaflet strut chords, always in tension, prevent leaflet intrusion into the outflow tract (ie, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve) and bias leaflet motion toward closure throughout diastole.<sup>53</sup>

### **MITRAL STENOSIS**

# Etiology

Mitral stenosis generally is the result of rheumatic heart disease. 54-62 Nonrheumatic causes of mitral stenosis or LV inflow obstruction include severe mitral annular and/or leaflet calcification in the elderly, congenital mitral valve deformities, malignant carcinoid syndrome, neoplasm, LA thrombus, endocarditic vegetations, certain inherited metabolic diseases, and those cases related to previous commissurotomy or an implanted prosthesis. 55-59,63,64 A definite history of rheumatic fever can be obtained in only about 50 to 60% of patients; women are affected more often than men by a 2:1 to 3:1 ratio. Nearly always acquired before age 20, rheumatic valvular disease becomes clinically evident one to three decades later.

Globally, there are approximately 20 million cases of rheumatic fever, the greatest burden of which is evident as rheumatic heart disease with 282,000 new cases and 233,000 deaths annually.<sup>60-62,65</sup> In the United States, Western Europe, and other developed countries, the prevalence of mitral stenosis has decreased markedly. The etiologic agent for acute rheumatic fever is group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, but the specific immunologic and inflammatory mechanisms leading to the valvulitis are less clear.<sup>61,62,65-68</sup> Streptococcal antigens cross react with human tissues, known as *molecular mimicry*,

and may stimulate immunologic responses. Components implicated in the organism's virulence include the hyaluronic acid capsule and the antigenic streptococcal M-protein and its peptides. 61,65-67 Mimicry between streptococcal antigens and heart tissue proteins, combined with high inflammatory cytokine and low interleukin-4 production, leads to the development of autoimmune reactions and cardiac tissue damage. 61,66,67 In acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, M-protein can cross react with cardiac myosin, which induces T-cell-mediated injury of cardiac tissue and valves. 61

In addition to valvular involvement, rheumatic heart disease is a pancarditis affecting to various degrees the endocardium, myocardium, and pericardium<sup>54,58,61</sup> (Fig. 34-5). In rheumatic valvulitis, mitral valve involvement is the most common (isolated mitral stenosis is found in 40% of patients), followed by combined aortic and mitral valve disease, and least frequently, isolated aortic valve disease. Pathoanatomical characteristics of mitral valvulitis include commissural fusion, leaflet fibrosis with stiffening and retraction, and chordal fusion and shortening<sup>59</sup> (Fig. 34-6). Leaflet stiffening and fibrosis can be exacerbated over time by increased flow turbulence. Valvular regurgitation can develop as a result of chordal fusion and shortening. The degree of calcification varies and is more common and of greater severity in men, older patients, and those with a higher transvalvular

gradient.<sup>54</sup> In some cases, rheumatic myocarditis results in LV dilatation and progressive heart failure.

Mitral annular calcification may progress to mitral sclerosis and stenosis in the elderly or those who are dialysis dependent. <sup>59,64</sup> The anterior leaflet can become thick and immobile; LV inflow obstruction also results from calcification of the posterior mitral valve leaflet. Calcific protrusions into the ventricle and extension of the calcium into the leaflets further narrow the valve orifice, resulting in mitral stenosis. <sup>59,64</sup> In these cases, the left ventricle typically is small, hypertrophied, and noncompliant.

# Hemodynamics

In patients with mitral stenosis, an early, middle, and late diastolic transvalvular gradient is present between the left atrium and ventricle; as the degree of mitral stenosis worsens, a progressively higher gradient occurs, especially late in diastole. <sup>55,69,70</sup> The average LA pressure in patients with severe mitral stenosis may be in the range of 15 to 20 mm Hg at rest, with a mean transvalvular gradient of 10 to 15 mm Hg. <sup>69,70</sup> With exercise, the LA pressure and gradient rise substantially.

Another physiologic measurement in patients with mitral stenosis is the (derived) cross-sectional valve area, which is calculated from the mean transvalvular pressure gradient and cardiac output. The transvalvular pressure gradient is a function of the square of the transvalvular flow rate; for example, doubling the flow quadruples the gradient. Mitral transvalvular flow depends on cardiac output and heart rate. An increase in heart rate decreases the duration of transvalvular LV filling during diastole; the transvalvular mean gradient increases, and consequently, so does LA pressure. A high transvalvular gradient may be associated with a normal cardiac output. Conversely, if cardiac output is low, only a modest transvalvular gradient may be present.

Because of effective atrial contraction, the mean LA pressure in patients with mitral stenosis and normal sinus rhythm is lower than that in patients with atrial fibrillation. T2,73 Sinus rhythm further augments flow through the stenotic valve, thereby helping to maintain adequate forward cardiac output. The development of atrial fibrillation decreases cardiac output by 20% or more; atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response can lead to acute dyspnea and pulmonary edema. T2

# Ventricular Adaptation

In patients with isolated mitral stenosis and restricted LV inflow, LV end-diastolic volume is normal or smaller than normal, and the end-diastolic pressure typically is low. 55,74,75 The peak filling rate is reduced, as is stroke volume. Cardiac output thus is diminished as a result of inflow obstruction leading to underfilling of the ventricle rather than LV pump failure. The During exercise, LV ejection fraction (LVEF) may increase slightly; however, LV filling is compromised by the shorter diastolic filling periods at higher heart rates, resulting in a smaller end-diastolic volume (or LV preload). Therefore,

stroke volume and a blunted increase (or even decrease) in cardiac output can occur.<sup>75</sup>

Approximately 25 to 50% of patients with severe mitral stenosis have LV systolic dysfunction as a consequence of associated problems (eg, mitral regurgitation, aortic valve disease, ischemic heart disease, rheumatic myocarditis or pancarditis, and myocardial fibrosis) or internal constraint of a rigid mitral valve, reduced preload, and reflex increase in afterload. 54,59,70,75 In these patients, LV end-systolic and diastolic volumes may be larger than normal. Diastolic dysfunction and abnormal chamber compliance are sometimes evident. 59 Also, because right ventricular afterload increases as pulmonary hypertension develops in these patients, right ventricular systolic performance deteriorates. 55,77

# **Atrial Adaptation**

In patients with mitral stenosis who are in normal sinus rhythm, the LA pressure tracing is characterized by an elevated mean LA pressure with a prominent a wave.<sup>73</sup> Because of the stenotic valve, coordinated LA contraction is important in maintaining adequate transvalvular flow.<sup>73</sup> The high LA pressure gradually leads to LA hypertrophy and dilatation, atrial fibrillation, and atrial thrombus formation. 54,75,76 The degree of LA enlargement and fibrosis does not correlate with the severity of the valvular stenosis partly because of the marked variation in duration of the stenotic lesion and atrial involvement by the underlying rheumatic inflammatory process.75 Disorganized atrial muscle fibers are associated with abnormal conduction velocities and inhomogeneous refractory periods. Premature atrial activation owing to increased automaticity or reentry eventually may lead to atrial fibrillation, which is present in more than half of patients with either pure mitral stenosis or mixed mitral stenosis and regurgitation.<sup>78</sup> Major determinants of atrial fibrillation in patients with rheumatic heart disease include older age and larger LA diameter.<sup>78</sup>

# **Pulmonary Changes**

In patients with mild-to-moderate mitral stenosis, pulmonary vascular resistance is not increased, and pulmonary arterial pressure may remain normal at rest, rising only with exertion or increased heart rate. <sup>69</sup> In severe chronic mitral stenosis with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, pulmonary arterial pressure is elevated at rest and can approach systemic pressure with exercise. A pulmonary arterial systolic pressure greater than 60 mm Hg significantly increases impedance to right ventricular emptying and produces high right ventricular end-diastolic and right atrial pressures.

LA hypertension produces pulmonary vasoconstriction, which exacerbates the elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. 54,77 As the mean LA pressure exceeds 30 mm Hg above oncotic pressure, transudation of fluid into the pulmonary interstitium occurs, leading to reduced lung compliance. Pulmonary hypertension develops as a result of passive transmission of high LA pressure, pulmonary venous hypertension, pulmonary arteriolar constriction, and eventually,

pulmonary vascular obliterative changes. Early changes in the pulmonary vascular bed may be considered protective in that the elevated pulmonary vascular resistance protects the pulmonary capillary bed from excessively high pressures. However, the pulmonary hypertension worsens progressively, leading to right-sided heart failure, tricuspid insufficiency, and occasionally, pulmonic valve insufficiency. 55,77,60

### Clinical Evaluation

Because of the gradual development of mitral stenosis, patients may remain asymptomatic for many years. 59,60,69,79,80 Characteristic symptoms of mitral stenosis eventually develop and are associated primarily with pulmonary venous congestion or low cardiac output, for example, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and fatigue. With progressive stenosis (valve area between 1 and 2 cm<sup>2</sup>), patients become symptomatic with less effort. Correspondingly, the transmitral mean gradient is usually between 5 and 10 mm Hg at a normal heart rate.<sup>80</sup> The mean pressure gradient is dependent on the transvalvular flow and diastolic filling period and will vary with changes in heart rate. When mitral valve area decreases to about 1 cm<sup>2</sup>, symptoms become more pronounced. As pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure subsequently develop, signs of tricuspid regurgitation, hepatomegaly, peripheral edema, and ascites can be found.

As a result of high LA pressure and increased pulmonary blood volume, hemoptysis may develop secondary to rupture of dilated bronchial veins (or submucosal varices). 59,77,79 Over time, pulmonary vascular resistance becomes higher, and the likelihood of hemoptysis decreases. Hemoptysis also may result from pulmonary infarction, which is a late complication of chronic heart failure. Acute pulmonary edema with pink frothy sputum can occur as a result of alveolar capillary rupture.

Systemic thromboembolism, occurring in approximately 20% of patients, may be the first symptom of mitral stenosis; recurrent embolization occurs in 25% of patients.<sup>79,81</sup> The incidence of thromboembolic events is higher in patients with mitral stenosis or mixed mitral stenosis-mitral regurgitation than in those with pure mitral regurgitation. At least 40% of all clinically important embolic events involve the cerebral circulation, approximately 15% involve the visceral vessels, and 15% affect the lower extremities.<sup>79,82</sup> Embolization to coronary arteries may lead to angina, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction; renal embolization can result in hypertension.<sup>79</sup> Factors that increase the risk of thromboembolic events include low cardiac output, LA dilatation, atrial fibrillation, LA thrombus, absence of tricuspid or aortic regurgitation, and the presence of echocardiographic "smoke" in the atrium, an indicator of stagnant flow. Patients with these risk factors should be anticoagulated.<sup>79,81,82</sup> If an episode of systemic embolization occurs in patients in sinus rhythm, infective endocarditis, which is more common in mild than in severe mitral stenosis, should be considered.

Patients with chronic mitral stenosis are often thin and frail (cardiac cachexia), indicative of longstanding low cardiac output, congestive heart failure, and inanition.<sup>79</sup> Heart size usually

is normal, with a normal apical impulse on chest palpation. An apical diastolic thrill may be present. In patients with pulmonary hypertension, a right ventricular lift can be felt in the left parasternal region. Auscultatory findings include a presystolic murmur, a loud S1, an opening snap, and an apical diastolic rumble. 59,79,83,84 The presystolic murmur, which occurs because of closing of the anterior mitral leaflet, is a consistent finding and begins earlier in those in sinus rhythm than in those in atrial fibrillation.84 S1 is accentuated in mitral stenosis when the leaflets are pliable but diminished in later phases of the disease when the leaflets are thickened or calcified. As pulmonary artery pressure becomes elevated, S2 becomes prominent.85 With progressive pulmonary hypertension, the normal splitting of S2 narrows because of reduced pulmonary vascular compliance. Other signs of pulmonary hypertension include a murmur of tricuspid and/or pulmonic regurgitation and an S4 originating from the right ventricle. Best heard at the apex, the early diastolic mitral opening snap is caused by sudden tensing of the pliable leaflets during valve opening and is absent when the leaflets are rigid or immobile. 79,83 In mild mitral stenosis, the diastolic rumble is soft and of short duration; a long or holodiastolic murmur indicates severe mitral stenosis. The intensity of the murmur does not necessarily correlate with the severity of the stenosis; indeed, no diastolic murmur may be detectable in patients with severe stenosis, calcified leaflets, or low cardiac output.84

On chest radiography, LA enlargement is the earliest change found in patients with mitral stenosis; it is suggested by posterior bulging of the left atrium seen on the lateral view, a double contour of the right heart border seen on the posteroanterior film, and elevation of the left main stem bronchus. <sup>69</sup> The overall cardiac size often is normal. Prominence of the pulmonary arteries coupled with LA enlargement may obliterate the normal concavity between the aorta and left ventricle to produce a straight left heart border. In the lung fields, pulmonary congestion may be recognized as distention of the pulmonary arteries and veins in the upper lung fields and pleural effusions. If mitral stenosis is severe, engorged pulmonary lymphatics are seen as distinct horizontal linear opacities in the lower lung fields (Kerley B lines).

The electrocardiogram is not accurate in assessing the severity of mitral stenosis and in many cases may be completely normal. In patients with severe mitral stenosis and normal sinus rhythm, LA enlargement is the earliest change (a wide notched P wave in lead II and a biphasic P wave in lead V1). 59,69,86 Atrial arrhythmias are common in patients with advanced degrees of mitral stenosis. In those with pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy may develop and is associated with right axis deviation, a tall R wave in V1, and secondary ST-T-wave changes; however, the electrocardiogram is not a sensitive indicator of right ventricular hypertrophy or the degree of pulmonary hypertension. 86

Echocardiography has become the primary diagnostic method for assessing mitral valve pathology and pathophysiology. 3,59,60,80,87-89 Cross-sectional valve area and LA and LV dimensions can be quantified using two-dimensional (2D) transthoracic echocardiography (TTE).

Best appreciated in the parasternal long-axis view, features of rheumatic mitral stenosis include reduced diastolic excursion of the leaflets (Carpentier type IIIa leaflet motion, see below) and thickening or calcification of the valvular and subvalvular apparatus (Fig. 34-7A). M-mode findings include thickening, reduced motion, and parallel movement of the anterior and posterior leaflets during diastole. Doppler echocardiography accurately determines peak and mean transvalvular mitral pressure gradients that correlate closely with cardiac catheterization measurements.<sup>87</sup> To estimate mitral valve area, the pressure half-time (time required for the initial diastolic gradient to decline by 50%) has been employed; the more prolonged the half-time, the

more severe is the reduction in orifice area. 60,87 Using the pressure half-time determination, mitral valve area is equal to 220 (an empirical value) divided by the pressure half-time. Deriving mitral valve area using the pressure half-time method, however, generally has fallen out of favor. The mean mitral gradient at rest and with bicycle or supine exercise measured using Doppler echocardiography is more useful clinically than estimating mitral valve area; the simultaneous increase in right ventricular systolic pressure (estimated from continuous-wave or pulse-wave Doppler envelopes of the tricuspid regurgitation signal) during exercise is also revealing. The mitral separation index, which is the average of the maximum separation of the mitral leaflet

tips in diastole in parasternal and apical four-chamber views, shows good correlation with mitral valve area measured by planimetry and pressure half-time and may be able to discriminate between hemodynamically significant and insignificant mitral stenosis. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is better than the transthoracic approach for visualizing details of valvular pathology, such as valve mobility and thickness, subvalvular apparatus involvement, and extent of leaflet or commissural calcification. 59,60,87,88

Three-dimensional echocardiography facilitates spatial recognition of intracardiac structures and can evaluate cardiac valvular and congenital heart disease using both real-time 3D TTE and TEE images<sup>60,89,91</sup> (Fig. 34-7B-D). The addition of color-flow Doppler to 3D echocardiography provides better visualization of regurgitant lesions. Measurements of LV volume using 3D echocardiography correlate tightly with measurements obtained using both contrast ventriculography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cardiac MRI technology remains inferior to echocardiography for depiction of valvular morphology and motion. <sup>92</sup> Multidetector computed tomography (CT) may emerge as a technique that can evaluate both cardiac structure and function. Experience with gated multidetector CT has yielded good visualization of valve leaflet hinges, commissures, and the mitral annulus. <sup>93</sup>

Cardiac catheterization is not necessary to establish the diagnosis of mitral stenosis; however, it provides information regarding coronary artery status in older patients. Left-sided heart catheterization allows determination of LV end-diastolic pressure; right-sided heart catheterization is performed to measure cardiac index and the degree of pulmonary hypertension. Rarely, cardiac catheterization is used

to evaluate the reversibility of severe pulmonary hypertension using pharmacologic interventions, including inhaled nitric oxide when indicated.

# Postprocedure Outcome

Whereas LV systolic function is used to predict the natural history and postoperative prognosis of patients with other valvular lesions, there are few data linking LV function to outcome in patients with mitral stenosis. Not surprisingly, the best indicator is related to the degree of clinical impairment. Untreated mitral stenosis is associated with a poor prognosis once severe symptoms occur.<sup>59</sup> Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty is the mainstay of treatment of mitral stenosis provided the anatomy is favorable<sup>59,60,80</sup> (Fig. 34-8). Generally, the technique immediately doubles mitral valve area and decreases the gradient substantially in properly selected patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis. Approximately 90% of patients improve clinically if a valve area greater than 1.5 cm<sup>2</sup> without significant regurgitation can be achieved. 94 Surgical intervention (eg, open mitral commissurotomy or mitral valve replacement) substantially improves functional capacity and long-term survival of patients with mitral stenosis; 67 to 90% of patients are alive at 10 years.86,95-97

Despite a higher operative risk for patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure, these individuals usually improve postoperatively with a reduction in pulmonary vascular pressures.<sup>55,98</sup> If there is not excessive scarring of the subvalvular mitral apparatus, mitral valve replacement using chordal-sparing techniques can be performed in patients with rheumatic mitral valve

disease, particularly those with mixed stenotic and regurgitant lesions; this results in a reduction in LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes and preservation of LV systolic pump performance. 99,100 Alternatively, the valve and the entire subvalvular apparatus have to be resected during mitral valve replacement when the disease process is very advanced and all structures are densely calcified and extremely scarred, which frequently is the case in older patients.

### **Summary**

Mitral stenosis generally is caused by rheumatic heart disease. With worsening mitral stenosis, a progressively higher transvalvular pressure gradient develops. Mitral transvalvular flow depends on cardiac output and heart rate; an increase in heart rate decreases the duration of transvalvular filling during diastole and reduces forward cardiac output, causing symptoms. In mild-to-moderate mitral stenosis, pulmonary vascular resistance may not be elevated; pulmonary arterial pressure may be normal at rest and rise only with exercise or increased heart rate. In patients with severe mitral stenosis with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, the pulmonary arterial pressure usually is high at rest. Characteristic symptoms of mitral stenosis are associated with pulmonary venous congestion and/or low cardiac output. Echocardiography remains the best technique for assessing mitral valve pathology. Percutaneous or surgical intervention can improve functional capacity and long-term survival of patients with mitral stenosis.

### **MITRAL REGURGITATION**

# Etiology

The functional competence of the mitral valve relies on proper, coordinated interaction of the mitral annulus and leaflets, chordae tendineae, papillary muscles, left atrium, and left ventricle, known as the *valvular-ventricular complex*. 41,101-104 Normal LV geometry and alignment of the papillary muscles and chordae

tendineae permit leaflet coaptation and prevent prolapse during ventricular systole. Dysfunction of any one or more of the components of this valvular-ventricular complex can lead to mitral regurgitation. Important causes of mitral regurgitation include myxomatous degeneration ("primary" mitral regurgitation), ischemic heart disease with ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR), dilated cardiomyopathy [for which the general term functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) is used], rheumatic valve disease, mitral annular calcification, infective endocarditis, congenital anomalies, endocardial fibrosis, myocarditis, and collagen-vascular disorders. 54,57,58,105-108 IMR is considered a specific subset of FMR, which is now termed "secondary" mitral regurgitation. Acute mitral regurgitation also may be the result of ventricular dysfunction from rapidly developing cardiomyopathy, such as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, in which the mitral regurgitation is caused by LV outflow tract obstruction and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve from apical ballooning. 109

In general, four types of structural changes of the mitral valve apparatus may produce regurgitation: leaflet retraction from fibrosis and calcification, annular dilatation, chordal abnormalities (including rupture, elongation, or shortening), and LV systolic dysfunction with or without papillary muscle involvement. 41,110-116 Carpentier classified mitral regurgitation according to three main pathoanatomic types based on mitral leaflet motion: normal leaflet motion (type I), leaflet prolapse or excessive motion (type II), and restricted leaflet motion (type III). 110,111 Type III is further subdivided into types IIIa and IIIb based on leaflet restriction during diastole (type IIIa), as seen in rheumatic disease, or during systole (type IIIb), which is typically seen in IMR (Fig. 34-9). Mitral regurgitation with normal leaflet motion can result from annular dilatation, often secondary to LV dilatation, for example, patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or ischemic cardiomyopathy. Normal leaflet motion also includes patients with leaflet perforation due to endocarditis or a congenital cleft. Leaflet prolapse typically results from a floppy mitral valve with chordal elongation and/or rupture, but rarely also can be seen in patients with coronary artery disease who have papillary muscle elongation

**FIGURE 34-9** Carpentier's functional classification of the types of leaflet and chordal motion associated with mitral regurgitation. In type I, the leaflet motion is normal. Type II mitral regurgitation is caused by leaflet prolapse or excessive motion. Type III (restricted leaflet motion) is subdivided into restriction during diastole (A) or systole (B). Type IIIb typically is seen in patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation. The course of the leaflets during the cardiac cycle is represented by the dotted lines.

or rupture. Mitral regurgitation caused by restricted leaflet motion is associated with rheumatic valve disease (types IIIa and IIIb), ischemic heart disease (IMR with type IIIb restricted systolic leaflet motion secondary to apical tethering or tenting), and dilated cardiomyopathy (type IIIb).<sup>111,112</sup>

### MYXOMATOUS DEGENERATION

Myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve, also known as floppy mitral valve or mitral valve prolapse and considered primary mitral regurgitation, is the most common cause of mitral regurgitation in patients undergoing surgical evaluation in the United States. 41,108,117-120 Afflicting 2 to 3% of the general population, mitral valve prolapse is both acquired (fibroelastic deficiency in older patients) and congenital or heritable, with excess spongy, weak fibroelastic connective tissue constituting the leaflets and chordae tendineae (Barlow's valve in younger patients) 54,80,108,121,122 (Fig. 34-10). Associated with connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, and aneurysm-osteoarthritis syndrome, mitral valve prolapse appears to be the result of multiple genetic pathways and can be sporadic or familial with autosomal dominant and X-linked inheritance. 108,123,124 Although three different loci on chromosomes 16, 11, and 13 (autosomal dominant) are linked to mitral valve prolapse, no specific gene has yet been incriminated. 108,123,124 Also, a locus on chromosome X cosegregates with a rare form of mitral valve prolapse called X-linked myxomatous mitral valve dystrophy. 108,124 Upregulation of transforming growth factor-beta and the mutations of the cytoplasmic protein filamins appear

to have a pivotal role in various pathways in the pathogenesis of mitral valve prolapse. <sup>108</sup> Because the dysfunctional valve is the disease, myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve is considered primary mitral regurgitation. <sup>80,125</sup>

Some degree of mitral valve prolapse is seen echocardiographically in 5 to 6% of the female population. 121,126 The risk of endocarditis is increased only if valvular regurgitation is present and accompanied by a murmur. Mitral valve prolapse appears to be more widespread in women, but severe mitral regurgitation resulting from mitral valve prolapse is more common in men. Subtle signs of heart failure, usually manifest as declining stamina and fatigue, may be the presenting complaint in 25 to 40% of symptomatic patients with mitral valve prolapse. As strictly defined originally by John Barlow, "Barlow's syndrome" includes prolapse of the posterior leaflet and chest pain, and occasionally palpitations, syncope, and dyspnea; in younger patients, the initial clinical sign is a midsystolic nonejection click, which later evolves into a click followed by a late systolic murmur. 121 This latter scenario is seen typically in young patients with Barlow's valves, in which large amounts of excessive leaflet tissue and marked annular dilatation are coupled with extensive billowing of both leaflets. Because many patients have had symptoms consistent with mitral valve prolapse syndrome for many years prior to developing significant mitral regurgitation, in certain patients, beta-adrenergic receptor polymorphisms may play a role in the pathogenesis of symptoms. 127

Pathologically, the atrial aspect of the prolapsing mitral leaflet often is thickened focally, whereas the changes on the ventricular surface of the leaflet consist of connective tissue thickening primarily on the interchordal segments with fibrous proliferation into adjacent chordae and onto the ventricular endocardium. 54,108,121,122 Histologically, elastic fiber and collagen fragmentation and disorganization are present, and acid mucopolysaccharide material accumulates in the leaflets. Myxomatous degeneration commonly involves the annulus, resulting in annular thickening and dilatation. All these changes are pronounced in young patients with Barlow's valves but can be minimal in older subjects with fibroelastic deficiency, in whom the noninvolved posterior leaflet scallops and anterior leaflet are normal and thin.80 It is important to recognize that these two distinct varieties of mitral valve prolapse exist and can be segregated on clinical grounds, even if pathologists have difficulty discriminating between the two, because the repair techniques differ in major ways. Many centers like the Mayo Clinic encounter mainly elderly patients with coronary artery disease and fibroelastic deficiency (78% of their surgical "flail" leaflet surgical population were greater than 60 years old and/or required concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting), in whom the valvular pathology is limited, and simple repair techniques, such as the small McGoon triangular excision of the middle scallop of the posterior leaflet, are applicable and work well.<sup>128</sup> In contrast, other institutions may attract younger patients who have Barlow's valves or severely myxomatous mitral valves, circumstances that demand much more extensive repair techniques and different expertise.

Only 5 to 10% of patients with mitral valve prolapse progress to develop severe mitral regurgitation, and they can remain relatively asymptomatic for many years. 121 Mechanisms accounting for severe mitral regurgitation in those with mitral valve prolapse include annular dilatation and rupture or elongation of the first-order chordae (58%), annular dilatation without chordal rupture (19%), and chordal rupture without annular dilatation (19%). 122 Chordal rupture, probably related to defective collagen, underlying papillary muscle fibrosis or dysfunction, or bacterial endocarditis, typically is the culprit when mitral regurgitation develops acutely in patients without any previous symptoms of heart disease or suddenly becomes worse in those with known mitral valve prolapse. 41,54,56,57,106,108,129 Chordal rupture is evident in 14 to 23% of surgically excised purely regurgitant valve specimens; in 73 to 93% of these patients, the underlying pathology is degenerative or floppy mitral valves.<sup>56,57,106</sup> Posterior chordal rupture, usually subtending just the middle scallop, is the most frequent finding, followed by anterior chordal rupture and then combined anterior and posterior chordal rupture. 56,57,106

# FUNCTIONAL AND ISCHEMIC MITRAL REGURGITATION

FMR is the result of incomplete mitral leaflet coaptation in the setting of LV systolic dysfunction and dilatation with or without annular dilatation (eg, dilated cardiomyopathy or ischemic cardiomyopathy) and is thus now termed secondary mitral regurgitation. <sup>80,113-116,125</sup> LV systolic dysfunction and dilatation also may be associated with longstanding mitral regurgitation caused by severe chronic LV volume overload. Most commonly, the etiology of nonischemic cardiomyopathy is unknown or idiopathic; the second most common cause is advanced valvular disease. FMR occurs in 40% of patients with heart failure caused by dilated cardiomyopathy. <sup>116</sup>

IMR, a subset of FMR, is becoming widely appreciated as the population ages and more patients survive acute myocardial infarction. In those with acute infarction, IMR occurs in approximately 15% of patients with anterior wall involvement and up to 40% of patients with an inferior infarct. 56,57,130 Generally, the severity of mitral regurgitation is related to the size of the area of LV akinesia or dyskinesia. The pathophysiology of IMR can be attributed to changes in global and regional LV function or geometry, alterations in mitral annular geometry, abnormal leaflet motion and malcoaptation, increased interpapillary distance, and papillary muscle malalignment leading to apical tethering of the leaflets with restricted systolic leaflet motion (type IIIb). 110,113,114,130-139 Because of the interdependence of the elements constituting the valvularventricular complex in IMR, perturbation of any component, such as LV systolic function and geometry, annular geometry, leaflet motion and morphology, and papillary and chordal relationship, may result in mitral regurgitation.

Left Ventricular Systolic Function and Geometry. Although LV dilatation and dysfunction are less pronounced in the setting of inferior myocardial infarction than that

affecting the anterior wall, the incidence and severity of mitral regurgitation are greater in patients with inferior infarction. 56,57,130,132,134 Over time, as the left ventricle dilates and changes shape after the ischemic event (postinfarction remodeling), the degree of IMR progresses. 115,134,140 Geometric changes associated with ventricular remodeling, such as posteromedial papillary muscle dislocation in the lateral axis, may lead to leaflet tenting, as reflected by a larger distance from the middle of the anterior annulus (saddle horn on echocardiography) to the posteromedial papillary muscle tip, and increased annular diameter. 115,135,136,140 At the ventricular level, myocardial infarction associated with chronic IMR is associated with greater adverse perturbations in LV systolic torsion and diastolic recoil than myocardial infarction without chronic IMR.141 These abnormalities may be linked to more LV dilatation, which possibly reduces the effectiveness of fiber shortening on torsion generation. Altered LV torsion and recoil may contribute to the "ventricular disease" component of chronic IMR, with increased gradients of myocardial oxygen consumption adversely affecting cardiac efficiency and impaired early diastolic filling.<sup>141</sup> Additionally, in a subacute model of IMR (less than 7 weeks), there is an equivalent increase in LV end-diastolic volume in those with mild mitral regurgitation compared to those with more severe mitral regurgitation, coupled with unchanged end-diastolic and end-systolic remodeling strains, including systolic circumferential, longitudinal, and radial strains; these findings in aggregate argue against an intracellular (cardiomyocyte) mechanism for the LV dysfunction.<sup>142</sup> Instead, differences in subepicardial shear strains suggest a causal role of altered interfiber interactions, and the mechanical impairment may be in extracellular matrix between the fibers and the microtubules in the cytoskeleton that couple cardiomyocyte shortening to LV wall thickening.142

Annular Geometry. In IMR, there may be increased mitral annular area, annular stretching and flattening (involving both anterior and posterior components of the annulus), increased septal-lateral annular dimension (also termed the anteroposterior axis), which is perpendicular to the line of leaflet coaptation), lateral displacement of posteromedial papillary muscle, and apically tethered posterior leaflet with restricted closing motion, any of which may contribute to leaflet malcoaptation<sup>132,133,135,136</sup> (Fig. 34-11). The septal-lateral annular dilatation and diminished LV systolic function determine mitral systolic tenting area, which in turn is predictive of the severity of the IMR. 132 LV dilatation and larger annular dimensions after inferior myocardial infarction require the mitral leaflets to cover more area during closing, exceeding their normal redundancy or "reserve," which is exacerbated by restricted leaflet closure (type IIIb motion) owing to apical leaflet tenting. Additionally, the distinctive saddle shape of the normal annulus, which becomes accentuated during systole, is eliminated which makes it flatter and suggests an association between maintaining the saddle shape and valvular competence. 132,143,144 Furthermore, in patients with IMR, the anterior and posterior annular perimeters and annular orifice

area (9.1 cm<sup>2</sup> compared with 5.7 cm<sup>2</sup> normally) are increased accompanied by an increase in the intertrigonal (anterior) annular distance and restriction of annular motion.<sup>136</sup>

Leaflet Motion and Morphology. Acute IMR from proximal left circumflex artery occlusion experimentally results in delayed valve closure in early systole (termed *leaflet loitering*) and increased leaflet edge separation throughout ejection in three leaflet coaptation sites across the valve, specifically near the anterior commissure, the valve center, and near the posterior commissure. <sup>131,133</sup> In addition, there is lateral displacement of the central scallop of the posterior leaflet, suggesting that interscallop malcoaptation and septal-lateral annular dilatation, can contribute to IMR in certain circumstances. <sup>139</sup> Clinically, chronic IMR is associated with apical systolic restriction of the posterior leaflet, thereby effectively preventing competent valve closure; this restriction results in a posteriorly directed eccentric MR jet due to anterior leaflet

"pseudoprolapse." Chronic IMR is also associated with posterior leaflet displacement in the posterior direction and lateral displacement of both leaflets. When the position of each leaflet edge is assessed independently, the anterior leaflet is not displaced apically after inferior infarction, although with more time and further remodeling, apical restriction of this leaflet may occur. 135 A strong echocardiographic determinant of leaflet tenting height is the distance from the tips of the papillary muscles to the saddle horn of the anterior annulus; LV end-diastolic volume is only weakly correlated with tenting height.145 Recent human observations have revealed that in some patients with IMR/FMR, there is growth or elongation of the leaflets associated with leaflet thickening that compensates for the larger orifice area and minimizes the amount of mitral regurgitation. In others, however, the leaflets do not become larger and cannot coapt normally across the large orifice, which causes more leaks. 146

In the past, the leaflet morphology in patients with FMR was considered normal, but further analyses have shown the leaflets to be biochemically different, with extracellular matrix changes associated with altered cardiac dimensions. 147,148 In recipient hearts obtained at time of transplantation, mitral leaflets have up to 78% more deoxyribonucleic acid, 59% more glycosaminoglycans, 15% more collagen, but 7% less water than autopsy control leaflets. 147,148 Radially and circumferentially oriented anterior mitral leaflet strips from failing hearts are 50 to 61% stiffer and less viscous. 148 Thus, the mitral leaflets in heart failure have altered intrinsic structural properties, suggesting that the permanently distended and fibrotic tissue is unable to stretch sufficiently to cover the valve orifice and that mitral regurgitation in these patients is not purely functional. 147,148

Papillary Muscle and Chordal Relationships. The papillary-annular distances in the LV long axis remain relatively constant in normal hearts throughout the cardiac cycle.114 During acute ischemia, however, these distances change, which reflects repositioning or dislocation of the papillary muscle tips with respect to the mitral annulus. This process can also contribute to apical tenting of the leaflets during systole. 110,114,135,149,150 With proximal circumflex artery occlusion and resulting IMR in an ovine model, the interpapillary distance and LV end-diastolic volume both increase. There is also increased mitral annular area and displacement of both (but predominantly the posteromedial) papillary muscle tips away from the septal annulus throughout ejection and at end-systole. 135,149 Posteromedial papillary muscle tip displacement probably results from failure of the ischemic papillary muscle to shorten during systole, lengthening of the ischemic papillary muscle over time, and dyskinesia of the ischemic LV wall subtending the papillary muscle. Since posterior papillary muscle displacement in the apical and posterior directions also occurs in sheep that did not develop substantial degrees of IMR, the additional posteromedial papillary muscle displacement in the lateral direction is a dominant factor in the development of IMR. 135 In the setting of posterolateral ischemia, a larger distance from the papillary muscle tips to the midseptal annulus is an important determinant of mitral regurgitant jet area and volume. 130,135 The nonischemic anterolateral papillary muscle may also play a role in apical leaflet restriction because this papillary muscle is displaced apically at end-systole relative to baseline. In sheep with mitral regurgitation, posteromedial papillary muscle tethering distance, papillary muscle depth, and papillary muscle angle are unchanged, and the anterolateral papillary muscle depth and papillary muscle angle decrease with decreasing ejection fraction. 149 Reduced systolic shortening of either papillary muscle in isolation, on the other hand, does not result in mitral regurgitation; thus, the previous notion that "papillary muscle dysfunction" by itself is responsible for IMR is not correct. In fact, papillary muscle dysfunction paradoxically can decrease mitral regurgitation resulting from inferobasal ischemia by reducing leaflet tethering, which improves leaflet coaptation. 151 Further insult to the LV wall underlying the papillary muscles is likely needed before valvular incompetence occurs. Acute IMR induced by experimental posterior LV ischemia is associated with chordal and leaflet tethering at the nonischemic commissural portion of the mitral valve and a paradoxical decrease of the chordal forces and relative prolapse at the ischemic commissural site. 137 Based on cardiac MRI of humans with ischemic heart disease, the loss of lateral shortening of the interpapillary muscle distance tethers the leaflet edges and impairs their systolic closure, resulting in mitral regurgitation.<sup>150</sup> Thus, it may be a combination of systolic annular dilatation and shape change and altered posteromedial and anterolateral papillary muscle position and motion that contributes to incomplete leaflet coaptation and IMR.

Papillary Muscle Ischemia and Rupture. Papillary muscle dysfunction in patients with ischemic heart disease has been thought to contribute to mitral regurgitation, although the significance of its role in IMR remains in question. 41,43,56,57,114,135,149,151 The papillary muscles are particularly susceptible to ischemia, more so the posteromedial papillary muscle (supplied only by the posterior descending artery in 63% of cases) than the anterolateral papillary muscle (supplied by both the left anterior descending and the circumflex arteries in 71% of cases). 41,43 Hence, myocardial infarction leading to papillary muscle dysfunction occurs more frequently with the posteromedial papillary muscle after an inferior myocardial infarction. Although papillary muscle necrosis can complicate myocardial infarction, frank rupture of a papillary muscle is rare. Total papillary muscle rupture usually is fatal as a result of severe mitral regurgitation and LV pump failure; survival long enough to reach the operating room in reasonable condition is possible with rupture of one or two of the subheads of a papillary muscle, which is associated with a lesser degree of acute mitral regurgitation. Papillary muscle rupture usually occurs 2 to 7 days after myocardial infarction; without emergency operation, approximately 50 to 75% of such patients may die within 24 hours. 152,153

#### RHEUMATIC DISEASE

With decreasing incidence in the United States, rheumatic fever remains a common cause of mitral regurgitation in developing countries. 41,56-58,105-107,154 It is unknown why rheumatic fever leads to valvular stenosis in some patients and pure regurgitation in others. The pathoanatomical changes of the purely regurgitant rheumatic valve differ from those in a stenotic valve. In chronic rheumatic mitral regurgitation, the valves have diffuse fibrous thickening of the leaflets with minimal calcific deposits and relatively nonfused commissures; chordae tendineae usually are not extremely thickened or fused.<sup>56-58</sup> There also may be shortening of the chordae tendineae, fibrous infiltration of the papillary muscle, and asymmetric annular dilatation primarily in the posteromedial portion. During the first episodes of rheumatic fever (average age is 9 years), patients may develop acute mitral regurgitation, which is more frequently related to annular dilatation and prolapse of the anterior or posterior mitral valve leaflet. 58,154 Those with anterior leaflet prolapse tend to improve with medical management; however, those with prolapse of the posterior leaflet have a less favorable outcome and often require early surgical repair. 154

### MITRAL ANNULAR CALCIFICATION

Mitral annular calcification is a degenerative disorder that usually is confined to elderly individuals; most patients are older than 60 years of age, and women are affected more often than men. 41,64 The pathogenesis of mitral annular calcification is not known, but it appears to be a stress-induced phenomenon; annular calcification also can be associated with systemic hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, and occasionally, advanced Barlow's disease. Other predisposing conditions include chronic renal failure and diabetes mellitus. Aortic valve calcification is an associated finding in 50% of patients with severe mitral annular calcification.

The gross appearance of mitral annular calcification may vary from small, localized calcified spicules to massive, rigid crescentic bars up to 2 cm in thickness in the annulus and leaflets.<sup>64</sup> Initially, calcification begins at the midportion of the posterior annulus; as the process progresses, the leaflets become upwardly deformed, stretching the chordae tendineae, and a rigid curved bar of calcium surrounding the entire posterior annulus in a horseshoe shape or even a complete ring of calcium may encircle the entire mitral orifice. The calcific deposit spurs extend into the LV myocardium and the conduction system, which can result in atrioventricular and/ or intraventricular conduction defects. Annular calcification causes mitral regurgitation by displacing and immobilizing the mitral leaflets (thereby preventing their normal systolic coaptation) or impairing the presystolic sphincteric action of the annulus. 64 As the degree of mitral regurgitation worsens over time, LV volume overload can lead to heart failure. Systemic embolization can occur if the annular calcific debris is extensive and friable.

# Hemodynamics

The pathophysiology of acute mitral regurgitation differs from that of chronic mitral regurgitation. Acute regurgitation may result from spontaneous chordal rupture, myocardial ischemia or infarction, infective endocarditis, or severe chest trauma. The clinical impact of acute mitral incompetence is modulated largely by the compliance of the left atrium and the pulmonary vasculature. In a normal left atrium with a relatively low compliance, acute mitral regurgitation results in high LA pressure, which can lead rapidly to pulmonary edema. Such is not the situation in patients with chronic mitral regurgitation, in whom compensatory changes over time increase LA and pulmonary bed venous compliance such that symptoms of pulmonary congestion may not occur for many years.

With mitral regurgitation, the impedance to LV emptying is lowered because the mitral orifice is in parallel with the LV outflow tract. 41,70,155 The volume of mitral regurgitation depends on the square root of the systolic pressure gradient between the left ventricle and the atrium, the time duration of the regurgitant leak, and the effective regurgitant orifice (ERO). 41,145,156,157 The ERO is determined echocardiographically using 2D color Doppler imaging to measure the crosssectional area of the vena contracta (narrowest width of the regurgitant jet) and the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA), or continuous-wave Doppler measuring the ratio of regurgitant volume to regurgitant time-velocity integral. 145,158 Regurgitation into the left atrium increases LA pressure and reduces forward cardiac output. LA pressure even may remain elevated at end-diastole (transient 5- to 10-mm Hg transvalvular gradient), representing a functional gradient associated with the increased diastolic LV filling rate.

If the mitral annulus is not rigid, various diagnostic and therapeutic interventions can alter ERO. Altered loading conditions (elevated preload and afterload) and decreased contractility result in progressive LV dilatation and a larger ERO. <sup>159</sup> When LV size is reduced by medical management (eg, digoxin, diuretics, and most importantly, systemic arteriolar vasodilators), ERO and regurgitant volume fall. <sup>160,161</sup> Stress echocardiography using an inotropic drug, such as dobutamine, usually decreases ERO and the degree of mitral regurgitation in patients with FMR and IMR because the LV chamber is smaller at the beginning of systole (or end-diastole) and throughout systole secondary to enhanced LV contractility. <sup>162</sup>

# Ventricular Adaptation

The loading conditions induced by mitral regurgitation promote more LV ejection because ventricular preload is increased and afterload is normal or decreased secondary to backward flow across the mitral valve. In terms of cardiac energetics, reduced LV impedance in patients with mitral regurgitation allows a greater proportion of contractile energy to be expended in myocardial fiber shortening than in tension development. 41,155 Because increased fiber shortening

is less of a determinant of myocardial oxygen consumption than other components, such as tension (or pressure) development and heart rate, mitral regurgitation causes only small increases in myocardial oxygen consumption. 155 Reduction in developed tension as a result of lower LV systolic wall stress (LV afterload) permits the ventricle to adapt to the substantial regurgitant volume by increasing LV end-diastolic volume to maintain adequate forward output. Along with lower afterload, this increase in preload (LV end-diastolic volume or, more precisely, LV end-diastolic wall stress) allows the heart to compensate for chronic mitral regurgitation for a long time before symptoms occur. 41,163,164 A fundamental response to increased preload is augmented stroke volume and stroke work, although effective forward stroke volume may be subnormal. High LV preload eventually leads to LV dilatation and shape change, meaning more spherical remodeling, owing to replication of sarcomeres in series as a consequence of chronic elevation of LV end-diastolic wall stress. 163,164 This process is in contrast to LV hypertrophy secondary to chronic pressure overload (elevated systolic wall stress) which leads to sarcomere replication in parallel. In chronic mitral regurgitation, LV mass also increases; however, the degree of hypertrophy correlates with the amount of chamber dilatation so that the ratio of LV mass to end-diastolic volume remains in the normal range (unlike the situation in patients with LV pressure overload). 165-167 The contractile dysfunction that evolves due to chronic LV volume overload is accompanied by increased myocyte length as well as reduced myofibril content. 164,165 The basic changes thus are a combination of myofibrillar loss and the absence of significant hypertrophy in response to the progressive decrease in LV pump function. The defect is intrinsic to the myocyte per se, but changes in the extracellular matrix also play a role. 142,168 Conversely, in acute mitral regurgitation, the ratio of LV mass to end-diastolic volume is reduced because chamber dilatation occurs suddenly, and the LV wall becomes acutely thinned; this increase in LV end-diastolic volume is associated with sarcomere lengthening along the length-tension curve. 164

After the initial compensatory phase, LV systolic contractility becomes progressively impaired as mitral regurgitation progresses chronically. <sup>166-169</sup> Because of the low impedance during systole, however, ejection-phase indexes of LV systolic function, such as ejection fraction, stroke volume, and fractional circumferential fiber shortening (%FSc), still can be normal even if LV contractile state has become depressed. <sup>168,170,171</sup> An ejection fraction of less than 55 to 60% or %FSc less than 28% in the presence of severe mitral regurgitation indicates an advanced degree of myocardial dysfunction. It is important to remember that all the ejection-phase indexes commonly used clinically to estimate LV pump performance, for example, ejection fraction, %FSc, cardiac output, stroke volume, stroke work, etc. are all affected by changes in LV preload and afterload.

Because of abnormal LV loading conditions in the setting of mitral regurgitation, load-independent indexes of LV contractility (eg, end-systolic elastance derived from the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship) or preload recruitable

stroke work (PRSW, also termed linearized Frank-Starling relationship) are preferred to measure LV systolic function and mechanics. 166-169,172,173 In hypertrophied and dilated hearts, as seen in chronic mitral regurgitation, however, the utility of end-systolic elastance may be limited because of LV chamber shape and size changes. It is necessary to use the end-systolic stress-volume relationship in these circumstances. One other problem inherent in the use of end-systolic elastance or stressvolume data is that end-systole and end-ejection are dissociated in patients with mitral regurgitation. End-ejection is defined as minimum LV volume and end-systole as the instant when LV elastance reaches its maximal value. Because of this temporal dissociation of end-systole from minimal ventricular volume, end-ejection pressure-volume relations do not correlate with maximal elastance values derived using isochronal methods.<sup>172</sup> End-systolic dimension or LV endsystolic volume (LVESV) is less dependent on LV loading conditions than is ejection fraction, and therefore is a better measure of LV systolic contractile function. LVESV varies directly and linearly with afterload, and inversely with contractile state. 169,174-176 The larger the LVESV becomes, the worse LV contractility. Correcting LVESV for chamber geometry, LV wall thickness and afterload (end-systolic wall stress [ESS]), and body size (LV end-systolic volume index [LVESVI]) provides reliable and accurate indexes of LV systolic function that are less influenced by loading conditions and variation in patient size. 174,175 Thus, preoperative LVESV or LVESVI is a better predictor of outcome in terms of postoperative LV systolic performance and cardiac death than is LVEF, end-diastolic volume, or end-diastolic pressure. 176

Based on load-independent indexes of LV contractility in experimental mitral regurgitation, the normalized endsystolic pressure-volume and end-systolic stress-volume relationships decline after 3 months of mitral regurgitation. 166 PRSW (the relation of stroke work to LV end-diastolic volume) and preload-recruitable pressure-volume area (the relation of stroke work to LV pressure-volume area) also fall, along with a decrease in efficiency of energy transfer from pressure-volume area to external pressure-volume work at matched LV end-diastolic volume. Furthermore, there is deterioration in ventriculoarterial coupling over time; that is, a mismatch develops between the ventricle and the total (forward and regurgitant) vascular load. 166 Although the overall (systemic plus LA) effective arterial elastance is decreased, there is a proportionally greater reduction in LV end-systolic elastance. Thus, LV systolic mechanics become impaired along with deterioration in global LV energetics and efficiency, and a mismatch develops in coupling between the left ventricle and the arterial bed. 166 Additionally, progression from acute to chronic mitral regurgitation (at 3 months) is associated with a decrease in maximum LV systolic torsional deformation from 6.3 to 4.7° and a decrease in early diastolic LV recoil from +3.8 to -1.5°. 177 Because torsion is a mechanism by which the left ventricle equalizes transmural gradients of fiber strain and oxygen demand, a decrease in systolic torsion in chronic mitral regurgitation may play a role in the inexorable and progressive decline of LV performance.<sup>177</sup> The left ventricle responds to decreased forward cardiac output resulting from mitral regurgitation by dilating; such dilatation equalizes the lengths of the endocardial and epicardial radii and thereby decreases systolic LV torsion. In assessing transmural 3D myocardial deformations in an ovine model of isolated mitral regurgitation, early changes in LV function at 12 weeks was evidenced by alterations in transmural strain (which may be detected before the onset of global LV dysfunction), but not by changes in B-type natriuretic peptide or PRSW.<sup>178</sup> The associated increase in transmural gradient of fiber strain and oxygen supply-demand imbalance results in a further decrease in forward cardiac output, leading to more LV dilatation and continuing the vicious cycle.

Diastolic inflow into the ventricle increases as total stroke volume increases during the evolution of mitral regurgitation and ventricular dilatation. 179-182 Acute mitral regurgitation enhances LV diastolic function by increasing the early diastolic filling rate and decreasing chamber stiffness. Flow across the mitral valve during early diastole is determined by the LA-LV pressure gradient, even though other factors, such as diastolic restoring forces and LV diastolic recoil (creating LV suction) during isovolumic relaxation also influence early LV filling. 179 In middle and late diastole, the lower LV chamber stiffness in patients with acute mitral regurgitation (evidenced by a shift of the LV diastolic pressure dimension or pressure-volume relationship to the right) allows the LV mean and LV end-diastolic pressures (and stresses) to remain in the normal range. In patients with chronic mitral regurgitation and preserved ejection fraction, LV chamber stiffness is also lower, similar to that during acute mitral regurgitation. Conversely, in those with impaired LV systolic function, chamber stiffness usually is normal.<sup>181</sup> In general, chronic mitral regurgitation causes a decrease in LV systolic contractile function but an increase in early diastolic function (as evidenced by an increase in early diastolic filling rate and a decrease in chamber stiffness). 182,183 The reduced chamber stiffness may be the result of altered ventricular geometry (more spherical shape); this shape change can exacerbate the degree of mitral regurgitation by distorting annular dimensions and dislocating the papillary muscles. 181,184 Although the LV chamber stiffness is less owing to the change in geometry, the LV myocardium may be stiffer as a result of myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis. 181,182

# **Atrial Adaptation**

Regurgitant flow into the left atrium leads to progressive atrial enlargement, the degree of which does not correspond directly with the severity of mitral regurgitation. <sup>74,155</sup> Also, the LA v wave in mitral regurgitation does not correlate with LA volume. Compared with patients with mitral stenosis, LA size can be larger in patients with longstanding mitral regurgitation, but thrombus formation and systemic thromboembolization occur less frequently because of the absence of atrial stasis. <sup>74,77</sup> Atrial fibrillation occurs less often in those with mitral regurgitation than in individuals with mitral stenosis. <sup>77</sup>

LA compliance is an important component of the patient's overall hemodynamic status if mitral regurgitation is present. 41,128,155,185 With sudden development of mitral regurgitation from chordal rupture, papillary muscle infarction, or leaflet perforation, LA compliance is normal or reduced. The left atrium is not enlarged, but the mean LA pressure and v wave are high. Gradually, the LA myocardium becomes hypertrophied, proliferative changes develop in the pulmonary vasculature, and pulmonary vascular resistance rises. As the mitral regurgitation becomes chronic and more severe, the left atrium becomes markedly enlarged, atrial compliance is increased, the atrial wall becomes fibrotic, but LA pressure remains normal or only slightly elevated. 185 In this situation, pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance usually are still in the normal range or only modestly elevated.

# **Pulmonary Changes**

Because chronic mitral regurgitation is associated with LA enlargement and only mild elevations in LA pressure, pronounced increases in pulmonary vascular resistance usually do not develop. In patients with acute mitral regurgitation with normal or reduced LA compliance, a sudden increase in LA pressure initially elevates pulmonary vascular resistance, and occasionally acute right-sided heart failure occurs. 41,129 Pulmonary edema is seen less frequently in patients with chronic mitral regurgitation than in those with mitral stenosis because elevated LA pressure is uncommon. In patients with IMR and heart failure, however, acute pulmonary edema is associated with the dynamic changes in IMR and the resulting increase in pulmonary vascular pressure. 186 Exercise-induced changes in ERO, tricuspid regurgitant pressure gradient (estimate of pulmonary artery systolic pressure), and LVEF are independently associated with the development of pulmonary edema. 186 From the standpoint of pulmonary parenchymal function and respiratory mechanics in patients with chronic mitral regurgitation, there is a decline in vital capacity, total lung capacity, forced expiratory volume, and maximal expiratory flow at 50% vital capacity. 186 These patients also may have a positive response to methacholine challenge; this bronchial hyperresponsiveness may result from increased vagal tone owing to longstanding pulmonary congestion.

### Clinical Evaluation

Patients with mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation may remain asymptomatic for many years as the left ventricle adapts to the increased workload and maintains normal forward cardiac output. Gradually, symptoms reflecting decreased cardiac output with physical activity and/or pulmonary congestion develop insidiously, such as weakness, fatigue, palpitations, and dyspnea on exertion. If right-sided heart failure appears late in the course of the disease, hepatomegaly, peripheral edema, and ascites occur and can be associated with rapid clinical deterioration. R7,188 Conversely, acute mitral regurgitation usually is associated with marked sudden pulmonary congestion and pulmonary edema. Patients with

coronary artery disease can present with myocardial ischemia or infarction and associated mitral regurgitation. Acute papillary muscle rupture may clinically mimic the presentation of a patient with a postinfarction ventricular septal defect. <sup>188,189</sup>

On physical examination, the cardiac impulse in patients with mitral regurgitation is hyperdynamic and displaced laterally; the forcefulness of the apical impulse is indicative of the degree of LV enlargement. In patients with chronic mitral regurgitation, S1 usually is diminished. S2 may be single, closely split, normally split, or even widely split as a consequence of the reduced resistance to LV ejection; a common finding is a widely split S2 that results from shortening of LV systole and early closure of the aortic valve. 108,190 An S3 gallop may be appreciated from the increased transmitral diastolic flow rate during the rapid filling phase. The apical systolic murmur of mitral regurgitation can be blowing, moderately harsh, or even soft and usually radiates to the axilla and left or right sternal border and occasionally to the neck or the vertebral column.<sup>190</sup> With rupture of the posterior leaflet first-order chordae, the mitral regurgitation jet is directed superiorly and impinges on the atrial septum near the base of the aorta, which can produce a murmur heard best along the right sternal border and radiating to the neck. 190,191 In cases of ruptured anterior leaflet first-order chordae, the leakage is aimed laterally and toward the posterior LA wall; the murmur may be transmitted posteriorly. Although there is no correlation between the intensity of the systolic murmur and the hemodynamic severity of the mitral regurgitation, a holosystolic murmur is characteristic of more regurgitant flow. In younger patients with Barlow's valves, early in the disease process, a characteristic midsystolic click is heard followed by a late systolic murmur; as the annulus and left ventricle dilate, the murmur over time becomes holosystolic, and the midsystolic click may become inaudible.

On chest radiography, cardiomegaly indicative of LV and LA enlargement is found commonly in patients with long-standing moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation. Chest x-ray findings of congested lung fields are less prominent in patients with mitral regurgitation than in those with mitral stenosis, but interstitial edema is seen frequently in individuals with acute mitral regurgitation and those with progressive LV failure secondary to chronic mitral regurgitation.

Changes on the electrocardiogram are not particularly useful and depend on the etiology, severity, and duration of the mitral regurgitation. R6,190 Atrial fibrillation can occur late in the natural history of the disease and usually causes sudden exacerbation of symptoms. In cases of chronic mitral regurgitation, LV volume overload leads to LA and LV dilatation, and eventually to LV hypertrophy. Electrocardiographic evidence of LV enlargement or hypertrophy occurs in one-half of patients, 15% have right ventricular hypertrophy owing to increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and 5% have combined left and right ventricular hypertrophy. In those with acute mitral regurgitation, LA and/or LV dilatation may not be evident, and the electrocardiogram may be normal or show only nonspecific findings, including sinus tachycardia or ST-T-wave alterations. Findings of myocardial ischemia or

infarction, more commonly noted in the inferior leads, may be present when acute mitral regurgitation is related to acute inferior myocardial infarction or myocardial ischemia; in these cases, first-degree AV block is a common coexisting finding.

In the majority of individuals with mitral valve prolapse, particularly those who are asymptomatic, the resting electrocardiogram is normal. R6,126 In symptomatic patients, a variety of ST-T-wave changes, including T-wave inversion and sometimes ST-segment depression, particularly in the inferior leads, can be found. Particularly in the inferior leads, can be found. Particularly in the inferior leads, can be found. Particularly in the inferior leads, can be found. Particularly in the inferior leads, can be found. Particularly prolongation also may be seen. Arrhythmias may be observed on ambulatory electrocardiograms, including premature atrial contractions, supraventricular tachycardia, AV block, bradyarrhythmias, and premature ventricular contractions. Patients arrhythmias may be present in upward of 14% of patients, and ventricular arrhythmias are present in 30% of patients.

TTE is the diagnostic mainstay in patients with valvular heart disease. In those with chronic mitral regurgitation, this modality is used to follow the progression of LA and LV dilatation.<sup>3,41,89,108,192,193</sup> Echocardiography identifies abnormalities in leaflet and chordal morphology and function, including myxomatous degeneration with or without leaflet prolapse, restricted systolic leaflet motion (as in IMR) or diastolic opening motion (as in rheumatic valve disease), lack of adequate coaptation due to annular dilatation or rheumatic valvulitis (fused subvalvular apparatus), and leaflet destruction by endocarditis<sup>3,41,87,89,158,193</sup> (Fig. 34-12). The degree of mitral regurgitation is assessed using 2D color Doppler echocardiography, which permits visualization of the origin, extent, direction, duration, and velocity of disturbed backward flow of the regurgitant leak.<sup>87,158,193</sup> Chordal rupture or elongation causing a flail leaflet is characterized by excessive motion of the leaflet backward into the left atrium beyond the normal leaflet coaptation zone. Papillary muscle rupture after myocardial infarction and annular dilatation can be visualized (Fig. 34-13). In patients with IMR or FMR, apical systolic tethering of the leaflets, tenting area and height, and leaflet opening angles can be quantitated using echocardiography<sup>145,156,158,194</sup> (Fig. 34-14). When the regurgitant leak is

caused in part or totally by annular dilatation, usually in the septal-lateral dimension, the coaptation height of the anterior and posterior leaflets can be measured.

In mitral regurgitation, ERO and regurgitant volume can be estimated quantitatively in many but not all patients using 2D color Doppler echocardiography. 145,157,158 ERO is an important predictor of outcome in a retrospective Mayo Clinic study of patients with mitral regurgitation and has been proposed as an indicator of when to proceed with mitral repair in asymptomatic patients with prolapse. 157 Accurate quantification of the degree of mitral regurgitation using ERO and regurgitant volume, however, is demanding, time consuming, fraught with error, and may not be available at all institutions. The hemodynamic magnitude or severity of the mitral regurgitation also can be estimated semiquantitatively by calculating mitral and aortic stroke volumes, with regurgitant volume being the difference between these two stroke volumes. Cardiac MRI is an accurate method to measure regurgitant volume and regurgitant fraction by comparing right- with left-sided flow. 92,195,196

Interest in the timing of the regurgitant leak has helped clinicians discern subtle details about the mechanism(s) responsible for the mitral regurgitation, infer information about the overall hemodynamic burden imposed by the LV volume overload, and predict the likelihood of successful and durable mitral repair. 145,156-158,194 IMR is primarily an early systolic leak, FMR occurs during early and middle systole (can be a biphasic pattern), and prolapse is associated with late systolic leaks. Although detected by pulse- and continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography for years, the timing of the mitral regurgitation also can be demonstrated using color Doppler M-mode echocardiography, which has a much faster temporal resolution (sampling frequency) than does 2D color Doppler echocardiography. Cardiac surgeons should study these color Doppler M-mode images carefully because the timing of the regurgitant leak yields important information about the mechanisms responsible for the mitral regurgitation, which in turn aids repair planning.

TTE is usually adequate to learn all that is necessary, but if high-quality TTE images cannot be obtained because of the patient's habitus or advanced emphysema, TEE provides superior image quality and can reveal additional anatomical and pathophysiologic information, including details of the valvular pathoanatomy and the mechanism, origin, direction, timing, and severity of the regurgitant leak.<sup>3,41,108,121,158,192,193,197</sup> TEE can detect small mitral vegetations, ruptured chordae, leaflet perforations or clefts, calcification, and other inflammatory changes and can be useful in patients with annular or leaflet calcification. TEE also is useful in patients with a previously implanted aortic valve prosthesis that can interfere with TTE assessment of mitral regurgitation owing to acoustic shadowing. Although intraoperative TEE during mitral valve repair is essential, a major limitation must always be remembered. The vascular unloading effects (vasodilatation) of general anesthesia downgrade the severity of mitral regurgitation. 198,199 The judgment about how much mitral regurgitation is present must be made on the basis of an awake TTE study when the patient has a normal ambulatory blood pressure. This concept is imperative in assessing the degree of mitral regurgitation in patients with IMR when deciding whether to add a mitral valve procedure at the time of coronary artery bypass grafting. For patients in whom the degree of mitral regurgitation has been minimized by the effects of anesthesia, intraoperative TEE provocative testing using vasoconstrictor drugs with or without volume infusion is mandatory to guide surgical decision making. Testing consists of reproducing the patient's normal awake or active ambulatory hemodynamic condition with preload challenge and afterload augmentation. 198,199 Preload challenge is performed after aortic cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass by rapidly infusing volume from the pump until the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure reaches 15 to 18 mm Hg. If severe mitral regurgitation is not produced, LV afterload is increased by intravenous boluses of phenylephrine until the arterial systolic pressure climbs to the 150-mm Hg range. In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, if both tests are negative, or regurgitation is induced but associated with new regional LV systolic wall motion abnormalities (ie, the regurgitation is caused by acute ischemia of viable myocardium), the valve may not require visual inspection because coronary revascularization usually is all that is necessary if the inferior wall myocardium is viable. If these tests confirm the presence of moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation, the valve is inspected and usually is repaired at the time of coronary revascularization.

Real-time 3D echocardiography is helpful in the visual assessment of congenital and acquired valvular disease<sup>3,108,121,194,200,201</sup> (Fig. 34-15). In patients with mitral regurgitation, this modality is fairly accurate in elucidating the dynamic mechanisms of the regurgitant leak(s). The addition of color-flow Doppler to 3D imaging provides improved visualization and may offer improved quantitative assessment of regurgitant valvular lesions.<sup>3,121</sup> Additionally, 3D echocardiography provides insight into the geometric deformities of the mitral leaflets and annulus, maximum tenting site of the mitral leaflet, and quantitative measurements of mitral valve tenting and annular deformity in patients with IMR.3,121,194,201 Real-time 3D color Doppler echocardiographic imaging provides direct measurement of vena contracta area. 3,200 The quantification of mitral regurgitant flow directly at the lesion using color Doppler echocardiography, however, has been prevented because of multiple aliasing from high flow velocities. Dealiasing of color Doppler flow at the vena contracta is feasible and appears promising for measuring severity of mitral regurgitation. This approach can be readily implemented in current systems to provide regurgitant flow volume and regurgitant fraction.<sup>3,200</sup>

Cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography are needed to determine coronary artery anatomy, but only in older patients with prolapse before repair and those with IMR. 41.85,163 Other techniques, such as calculating mitral regurgitant fraction (regurgitant volume determined as the difference between total LV angiographic stroke volume and the effective forward stroke volume measured by the Fick method), are limited. By measuring rest and exercise (supine bicycle) pulmonary artery pressures and cardiac output, right-sided heart catheterization can be useful occasionally to identify patients with primary myocardial disease who present with LV dilatation and relatively mild degrees of mitral regurgitation (who may not have a high likelihood of benefiting from mitral valve surgery) and those with severe mitral regurgitation who deny symptoms to see if they develop pulmonary hypertension with exercise.

Cardiac MRI can be employed to assess the cardio-vascular system, including cardiac structure and function. 92,108,150,195,196,202 Specialized MRI techniques, such as phase contrast velocity mapping, planimetry, or real-time color flow, have been used to evaluate and quantify the degree of mitral regurgitation. The presence of valvular regurgitation can be determined, LV volumes and mitral regurgitant fraction estimated, and information obtained concerning mitral and coronary anatomy. Direct measurement by MRI is a promising method for assessment of the severity of mitral regurgitation; MRI planimetry of the anatomical mitral regurgitant lesion permits quantification of regurgitation with good agreement with cardiac catheterization and echocardiography. 196 Constraints of MRI, such as pacemakers or

implanted defibrillators, morbid obesity, and claustrophobia, hamper the wider use of cardiac MRI. Multidetector CT is an imaging technique that can fully evaluate both cardiac structure and function, including coronary artery anatomy; this technology has yielded good visualization of valve leaflets, commissures, and mitral annulus.<sup>93</sup> Limitations include image noise, requirement for a regular rhythm and a slow heart rate during imaging, time required for postprocessing data analysis, and radiation dose.

# Postoperative LV Function and Surgical Outcomes

### **GENERAL**

Successful mitral valve surgery usually is associated with clinical improvement, augmented forward stroke volume with lower total stroke volume, smaller LV end-diastolic volume, and regression of LV hypertrophy.<sup>80,97,119,203-207</sup> Correction of

mitral regurgitation can preserve LV contractility, particularly in patients with a normal preoperative ejection fraction who have minimal ventricular dilatation and those without significant coronary artery disease. On the other hand, in patients with LV dysfunction preoperatively, improvement in LV systolic function may not necessarily occur after operation. An LVESVI exceeding 30 mL/m<sup>2</sup> is associated with decreased postoperative LV function. 176,208 Thus, it is proposed that patients with chronic primary mitral regurgitation should be referred for mitral valve surgery before LVESVI exceeds 40 to 50 mL/m<sup>2</sup> or when LV end-systolic dimension (LVESD) reaches 4 cm or greater, consistent with the 2014 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) practice guidelines<sup>80,176</sup> (Fig. 34-16). Significant determinants of increased operative risk for mitral valve surgery include older age, higher New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, associated coronary artery disease, increased LV end-diastolic pressure, elevated LV end-diastolic volume index, elevated LVESD, reduced LV ESS index,

depressed resting ejection fraction, decreased fractional shortening, reduced cardiac index, elevated capillary wedge or right ventricular end-diastolic pressure, concomitant operative procedures, and previous cardiac surgery.<sup>176,208-212</sup>

The decline in ejection fraction after mitral valve replacement for chronic mitral regurgitation historically was thought to result from an increase in LV afterload as a result of closure of the low-resistance early systolic "pop-off" into the left atrium and the surgical excision of the subvalvular apparatus. A spherical mathematical model defining the relations among LV end-diastolic dimension, systolic wall stress, and ejection fraction, demonstrated that postoperative changes in systolic stress are related directly to changes in chamber size, and LV afterload may *decrease* postoperatively if chordal-preservation valve replacement techniques are used. <sup>213</sup> In terms of exercise performance after surgery for nonischemic

mitral regurgitation, although patients generally report symptomatic improvement, cardiopulmonary exercise testing at 7 months may not be better than preoperatively, and abnormal neurohumoral activation persists, probably reflective of incomplete recovery of LV contractility. <sup>214</sup> Regarding long-term clinical outcome, risk factors portending postoperative cardiac deterioration include larger LV end-diastolic dimension, increased LVESD, increased LVESV, diminished fractional shortening, reduced LV ESS index, large LA size, decreased LV wall thickness/cavity dimension at end-systole, and associated coronary artery disease. <sup>176,211,215-217</sup>

### PRIMARY MITRAL REGURGITATION

To evaluate the impact of the severity of regurgitation on outcomes in asymptomatic patients with primary mitral regurgitation, a Mayo Clinic study retrospectively evaluated 456 middle-aged patients with at least mild holosystolic mitral regurgitation defined echocardiographically between 1991 and 2000.157 Baseline ejection fraction was 70%, LVESD was  $3.4 \pm 6$  cm, LVESD was  $5.6 \pm 8$  cm, LVESVI was  $33 \pm 130$ mL/m<sup>2</sup>, and regurgitant volume was 66 ± 40 mL/beat. At 5 years, 54% of patients had been operated on after an average of  $1.2 \pm 2$  years of medical treatment when symptoms occurred or when worrisome echocardiographic findings were detected (based on the 1998 ACC/AHA practice guidelines). Among those who underwent a mitral valve procedure, 91% received valve repair. The patients were stratified by degree of regurgitation; mild, moderate, and severe were defined as regurgitant volumes of less than 30, 30 to 59, and 60 or more mL/beat, and ERO was defined as less than 20, 20 to 39, and 40 or greater mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. For the medically treated patients, 5-year survival compared with U.S. Census life tables was significantly inferior for those with moderate regurgitation (ERO of 20 to 39 mm<sup>2</sup>, 66 vs 84%) and severe regurgitation (ERO of 40 mm<sup>2</sup> or more, 58 vs 78%).<sup>157</sup> The influence of ERO also held true for predicting cardiac deaths and all cardiac events. The 5-year cardiac death rate was 36% for patients with an ERO of 40 mm<sup>2</sup> or greater compared with 20% for those with an ERO of 20 to 39 mm<sup>2</sup> and only 3% for those with an ERO of less than 20 mm<sup>2</sup>. Mitral valve operation was an independent determinant of fewer deaths, cardiac deaths, and cardiac events, especially in those with a larger ERO.<sup>157</sup> This important study, which focuses on the predictive effects of the severity of the regurgitation instead of the response of the ventricle, provides the basis for the surgical approach to asymptomatic patients with primary mitral regurgitation. On the other hand, these patient were older and most probably had prolapse due to fibroelastic deficiency; thus, these recommendations cannot safely be generalized to younger patients with Barlow's mitral valve disease or other types of mitral regurgitation.

Managed with medical therapy, mitral regurgitation from a flail leaflet is associated with high annual (6.3%) mortality rates. 120,218,219 In these patients, mitral valve repair is feasible in the large majority of patients in experienced centers and offers excellent early and late functional results. 80,119,219-221 Because fewer complications and lower operative mortality risk are associated with valve repair compared with valve replacement in this patient population, operation should be considered earlier in the natural history of the disease if the pathologic anatomy is judged favorable for valve repair. 80,111,119,120,215,218-220,222

The 2014 AHA/ACC valve guidelines introduced several new concepts into clinical decision making for patients with mitral regurgitation. The assessment of patients with mitral regurgitation now includes the following clinical stages: (A) at risk for mitral regurgitation, (B) progressive mitral regurgitation, (C) asymptomatic severe mitral regurgitation, and (D) symptomatic severe mitral regurgitation (Table 34-1). For patients with primary mitral regurgitation (intrinsic leaflet disease) the degree of regurgitation is quantified with progressive regurgitation (or stage B) meaning a

vena contracta < 0.7 cm, regurgitant volume < 60 mL, regurgitant fraction < 50%, and ERO < 0.4 cm<sup>2</sup>. Severe regurgitation includes a vena contracta > 0.7 cm, regurgitant volume > 60 mL, regurgitant fraction > 50%, and ERO > 0.4 cm<sup>2</sup>. According to the 2014 ACC/AHA practice guidelines, all asymptomatic patients with chronic primary severe mitral regurgitation should be considered for operation if the LVEF is 30 to 60% or LVESD > 40 mm (class I evidence); asymptomatic patients in whom the LVEF > 60% and LVESD < 40 mm can be considered for early operation (class IIa evidence) if the likelihood of repair is 90% with an expected mortality of < 1% in a referent mitral surgical center<sup>80</sup> (Fig. 34-16). In healthier patients with LVEF greater than 63% and LVESD less than 39 mm, early mitral valve repair may also result in preserved long-term postoperative LV function.80,223 The AHA/ACC 2014 valve guidelines for chronic secondary mitral regurgitation (FMR or IMR) have also been modified (see below).

Because many patients with chronic mitral regurgitation report no symptoms, cardiopulmonary exercise testing has been used to evaluate asymptomatic patients with primary mitral regurgitation. <sup>224,225</sup> In a study of asymptomatic patients with severe mitral regurgitation with a regurgitant volume of 68 mL/beat and an ERO of 35 mm<sup>2</sup>, functional capacity was markedly reduced (defined as 84% or less than expected) in 19% of patients.<sup>224</sup> When patients with extraneous, noncardiac reasons for impaired functional capacity were excluded, 14% had a reduced functional capacity. Determinants of reduced functional capacity were impaired LV diastolic function, lower forward stroke volume, and atrial fibrillation; the impact of ERO on functional capacity was only modest.<sup>224</sup> Thus, it was the consequences of chronic mitral regurgitation and not the magnitude of the leak that predicted impaired functional capacity. Follow-up at 3 years revealed that 66% of patients with impaired functional capacity sustained some adverse event or required mitral surgery (vs 29% of those with normal functional capacity). 224 Consistent with the previous study, in patients with primary mitral regurgitation that underwent exercise echocardiography followed by mitral valve surgery, lower achieved metabolic equivalents were associated with worse long-term outcomes.<sup>225</sup> In those with preserved exercise capacity, delaying mitral valve surgery by greater than one year did not adversely affect outcomes.<sup>225</sup> Thus, asymptomatic patients with substantial mitral regurgitation should undergo periodic cardiopulmonary exercise testing to detect subclinical impairment in functional capacity, and repair should be recommended to those with impaired exercise capacity.

Even after mitral valve repair or replacement for chronic mitral regurgitation, some patients continue to be limited by heart failure symptoms and have suboptimal long-term postoperative outcomes. The incidence of congestive heart failure in patients who survive surgery (combined series of valve repair and valve replacement) for pure mitral regurgitation has been 23, 33, and 37% at 5, 10, and 14 years. <sup>226</sup> Patient survival after the first episode of congestive heart failure is dismal, being only 44% at 5 years.

#### SECONDARY MITRAL REGURGITATION

To risk stratify patients after myocardial infarction, quantifying and staging secondary mitral regurgitation (eg, IMR) are of key importance<sup>80,156,228-230</sup> (Table 34-2). In a report from

the Mayo Clinic, medically managed patients who developed IMR late after myocardial infarction had a very high mortality rate (62% at 5 years) compared with those with an infarction who did not develop IMR (39% at 5 years). Medium-term survival for patients with IMR and LV systolic dysfunction was inversely related to the ERO and regurgitant volume. After 5 years, the survival rate was 47% for patients with an ERO of less than 20 mm² and 29% for those with an ERO of 20 mm² or greater. Survival at 5 years was 35% when the regurgitant volume was 30 mL/beat or greater compared with 44% for those with a regurgitant volume of less than 30 mL/beat. The relative risk ratio for cardiac death for patients with IMR was 1.56 for patients with an ERO of less than 20 mm² versus 2.38 for those with an ERO of greater

than 20 mm². Note this ERO threshold for secondary IMR if one-half the ERO threshold applied to patients with primary MR. <sup>156,157</sup> In those with myocardial infarction, the incidence of congestive heart failure was also high in patients with IMR. <sup>229</sup> At 5 years, the rate of congestive heart failure was 18% without IMR compared with 53% if IMR was present. If the ERO was less than 20 mm², the incidence of congestive heart failure was 46% compared with 68% when the ERO was 20 mm² or greater. <sup>229</sup>

Mitral valve repair or replacement for patients with IMR has been associated with higher operative risk (4 to 30%) than for patients with nonischemic chronic mitral regurgitation, which reflects the concomitant adverse consequences of previous myocardial infarction and ischemia. 205,206,231-237

Coronary revascularization alone in the setting of moderate or severe IMR leaves many patients with substantial residual mitral regurgitation and heart failure symptoms. 113,238-240 Immediately postoperatively, IMR is absent or mild in 73% and severe in 6%; on the other hand, by 6 weeks, only 40% of patients have absent or mild mitral regurgitation, and 22% have severe mitral regurgitation 239 (Fig. 34-17). Because moderate IMR does not universally resolve with bypass grafting alone, it has been argued that valve repair be considered in these patients because it potentially can reduce cardiac morbidity and may improve long-term survival. 113,228,238 Conversely, some investigators have shown that for patients with moderate or moderately severe IMR, isolated coronary surgery compared to coronary revascularization combined with

mitral annuloplasty provide similar long-term outcome with survival rates of 82 to 92% at 1 year, 40 to 75% at 5 years, and 37 to 47% at 10 years<sup>232-234,241-243</sup> (Fig. 34-18). Predictors of long-term mortality are older age, prior myocardial infarction, unstable angina, chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation, absence of an internal mammary artery graft, lack of beta blocker use, lower ejection fraction, smaller LA size, global LV wall motion abnormalities, severe lateral wall motion abnormalities, ST segment elevation in the lateral leads, mitral leaflet restriction, and fewer bypass grafts. 232,234,241 In the experience of some investigators, combined mitral valve repair and coronary revascularization does not emerge as a predictor of long-term survival. Furthermore, in a recent report from the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network of 301 patients with moderate IMR randomized to coronary artery bypass grafting alone or combined coronary artery

bypass grafting with valve repair, the rate of death is 7.3% in and 6.7% at one year.<sup>244</sup> Although moderate or severe regurgitation is less common in the combined group than the coronary artery bypass group alone (11 vs 31%, respectively), the combined group had longer bypass time, longer hospital stay, and more neurologic events. Also, it is sobering that the addition of mitral valve repair does not result in a greater degree of LV reverse remodeling (measured by LVESI) at one year.<sup>244</sup>

To identify preoperatively those that would be more likely to benefit from isolated coronary artery bypass grafting, the Prague group evaluated 135 patients with moderate IMR undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass surgery; of these, 42% of the patients had no or mild mitral regurgitation post-operatively, whereas 47% failed to improve. Preoperatively, the improvement group had significantly more viable myocardium and less dyssynchrony between papillary muscles

(A) Unadjusted survival, based on 37 deaths after CABG alone and 92 after CABG + MV annuloplasty.

than the failure group. Thus, reliable improvement in moderate IMR by isolated coronary artery revascularization is likely only in patients with concomitant presence of viable myocardium and absence of dyssynchrony between papillary muscles. <sup>245</sup> In a pilot study of cardiac MRI in patients with IMR and ischemic cardiomyopathy, extensive scarring and severe wall motion abnormalities in the region of posterior papillary muscle correlated with recurrent mitral regurgitation after coronary artery bypass grafting and mitral annuloplasty. <sup>246</sup> Routinely assessing scar burden may identify patients for whom annuloplasty alone is insufficient to eliminate mitral regurgitation. Therefore, although some investigators report

that annuloplasty can be added to coronary grafting in highrisk patients without increasing early mortality, the potential benefit with respect to late survival and functional status is not proved and may be limited because of the underlying ischemic cardiomyopathy.<sup>233-234,247</sup>

In terms of the best type of valve surgery for patients with IMR, it is likely that the clinical condition and LV functional status are more powerful determinants of outcome than whether one undergoes repair or replacement. 231,248-252 In the Brigham and Women's Hospital experience, patients with IMR and annular dilatation who underwent valve repair and coronary revascularization had a worse long-term outcome than those who underwent valve replacement and coronary revascularization.<sup>231</sup> Notably, the pathophysiology or cause of the IMR was a stronger determinant of longterm survival than was the type of valve procedure. In the Cleveland Clinic experience, when patients with severe IMR underwent mitral valve surgery, undersized annuloplasty resulted in less IMR postoperatively in 70 to 85% of cases.<sup>249</sup> Based on propensity score analysis, they found that in the lower-risk quintiles of patients with IMR, valve repair conferred a survival advantage (58% at 5 years) over those who underwent valve replacement (36% at 5 years); however, in the highest-risk patients, late survival rates after valve repair and valve replacement were similarly poor, and valve replacement actually conferred a small survival advantage.<sup>250</sup> At the Laval University in Quebec, 370 patients with IMR underwent either mitral valve repair or mitral valve replacement.<sup>251</sup> The operative mortality was lower in the repair group (10%) compared with the replacement group (17%), but 6-year survival estimates were similar at 73 and 67%, respectively. The type of valve procedure did not emerge as a risk factor for a poor outcome. In the Italian Study on the Treatment of Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation Trial using propensity score matching analysis to evaluate surgical outcomes of patients with chronic IMR and LV dysfunction (ejection fraction less than 40%), those who underwent mitral valve repair had an 8-year survival rate of 82% compared to 80% for those undergoing mitral valve replacement.<sup>237</sup> Further, LV function did not improve in either group postoperatively, and mitral valve repair was a strong predictor of valve-related reoperation. The recent Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network multi-institutional randomized trial of 251 patients with severe IMR comparing complete rigid or semirigid ring annuloplasty with mitral valve replacement demonstrated no difference in LV reverse remodeling or survival at 12 months.<sup>252</sup> The rate of recurrent or residual moderate or severe IMR 6 months postoperatively was 32.6% in the annuloplasty group versus 2.3% in the MVR group. 252 Replacement provided a more durable correction of mitral regurgitation with no difference in clinical outcomes at this early follow-up period.<sup>252</sup> These reports emphasize the guarded prognosis of patients with severe IMR and the impact of the patient's preoperative clinical condition and LV functional status (and not the type of procedure per se) on outcome. Although mitral valve repair may still be preferred by some for patients with

severe IMR, most surgeons today believe complete chordal-sparing mitral valve replacement is preferable to repair in the most severely ill patients and in those with certain echocardiographic characteristics such as severe bileaflet tethering. Chordal-sparing MVR certainly is more predictable and reliable.

In patients with chronic primary versus secondary mitral regurgitation, the decision to repair or replace the valve should be based on the patient's clinical status and not on whether the regurgitation is degenerative or ischemic in etiology. 235,236,253 In a Mayo Clinic study, older age, ejection fraction of 35% or less, three-vessel coronary disease, mitral valve replacement, and residual mitral regurgitation at discharge were risk factors for death. The cause of the mitral regurgitation, ischemic versus degenerative, was not a predictor of long-term survival, class III or IV congestive heart failure, or recurrent regurgitation. 235 In the Cleveland Clinic experience, analysis of the etiology of the mitral regurgitation (degenerative vs ischemic) in patients with coronary artery disease after combined mitral valve repair and coronary revascularization showed that those with IMR had more extensive coronary disease, worse ventricular function, more comorbidities, and more preoperative symptoms.<sup>253</sup> Unadjusted 5-year survival estimates were 64 and 82% for patients with IMR and degenerative mitral regurgitation, respectively; however, matched pairs had equivalent but poor 5-year survival rates (66 and 65%, respectively). In the Duke database of patients undergoing mitral valve repair with or without coronary artery bypass grafting, the 30-day mortality was 4.3% for those with IMR and 1.3% for nonischemic group; the 5-year survival was 56% for IMR and 84% for those with nonischemic mitral regurgitation. <sup>236</sup> The etiology of mitral regurgitation (ischemic vs degenerative) was not predictive of survival after annuloplasty and coronary artery grafting; importantly, the long-term outcomes were more influenced by advanced age and the number of preoperative comorbidities<sup>236</sup> (Fig. 34-19).

A compelling explanation for the generally poor long-term outcome of patients who undergo mitral valve repair for IMR is the presence of residual and/or recurrent mitral regurgitation postoperatively.<sup>254-259</sup> Persistence of mitral regurgitation after annuloplasty is due predominantly to augmented posterior leaflet apical tethering with no improvement in anterior leaflet tethering and no increase in coaptation length; higher preoperative LVED index may also predict recurrent mitral regurgitation. 256-258 In a Cleveland Clinic report of annuloplasty for IMR (95% with concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting), the proportion of patients with 0 or 1+ mitral regurgitation decreased from 71% preoperatively to 41% postoperatively, but the proportion with 3+ or 4+ residual or recurrent IMR increased from 13 to 28% during the first 6 months after repair<sup>254</sup> (Fig. 34-20). The temporal pattern of development of severe regurgitation was similar for those who received a partial band or a complete ring (25%), but it was substantially worse for those who received a strip of glutaraldehyde-preserved xenograft pericardium for annuloplasty (66%).<sup>254</sup> Others have suggested that the

use of smaller, complete, and rigid annuloplasty rings may provide improved freedom from recurrent mitral regurgitation in patient with FMR or IMR.<sup>260</sup> At the Montreal Heart Institute, the operative mortality rate for those undergoing mitral valve repair for IMR was 12.3% and the 5-year survival was 68%.<sup>261</sup> Recurrent moderate mitral regurgitation was seen in 37%, and severe regurgitation was present in 20% at mean follow-up of 28 months. Only age and less marked preoperative posterior tethering were predictive of recurrent mitral regurgitation. Data from the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network severe IMR trial demonstrated a rate of recurrence of moderate regurgitation of 26% and of severe regurgitation of 4% at 6 months after mitral valve repair.<sup>257</sup> The presence of inferior basal aneurysm/dyskinesis was strongly associated with recurrent regurgitation and was a better predictor of recurrence than individual measures of leaflet tethering or LV remodeling, since it integrates both leaflet tethering and LV remodeling measures.<sup>257</sup> The Leiden experience with the use of restrictive mitral semirigid undersized annuloplasty (mean ring size of 26 mm) in patients with FMR and heart failure demonstrated a more satisfactory 19% rate of recurrent regurgitation (grade 2-4) at a mean follow up of 2.6 years.<sup>259</sup> Based on their method of quantification of preoperative parameters of mitral and LV geometry using echocardiography, distal anterior leaflet tethering and posterior leaflet tethering were independent predictors of recurrent mitral regurgitation<sup>259</sup> (Fig. 34-21).

the need for better patient selection or possibly chordal-sparing mitral valve replacement in certain patients. <sup>254,257,259,261,262</sup>

In brief, because mitral regurgitation is only one component of the disease, the appropriate management of patients with secondary mitral regurgitation or IMR is complicated, since restoring valve competence may not reverse the underlying pathophysiology or improve the prognosis.<sup>80,125</sup> For instance, in those with secondary mitral regurgitation, adverse outcomes are associated with lesser degrees of mitral regurgitation and with a smaller calculated ERO than those with primary mitral regurgitation.80 ERO, however, may be underestimated by 2D echocardiography-derived flow convergence method due to the crescentic shape of the regurgitant orifice.80 Importantly, the 2014 ACC/AHA valve guidelines revised the definition of severe secondary mitral regurgitation from an ERO of >0.4 to >0.2 cm<sup>2</sup> and a regurgitant volume of >60 to >30 ml.80,125 However, the new guidelines present clinical challenges because 2D and 3D

echocardiography may generate disparate findings of ERO and regurgitant volume, and the nature of secondary mitral regurgitation may be dynamic depending on medical therapy (loading conditions) and after revascularization or cardiac resynchronization. 125 In terms of decision making, a rebuttal to the 2014 AHA/ACC guidelines focusing so much on ERO in patients with secondary mitral regurgitation was published in 2014 by a group of experienced echocardiographers and cardiac surgeons arguing that an integrated approach based on clinical judgment that incorporates multiple echo Doppler parameters without relying on any single parameter is best. 125 This approach would discount poor quality data (eg, ERO underestimation by PISA) and employ multiple echocardiographic variables, recognize that the definition of "severe" (ERO > 0.2 cm<sup>2</sup> and regurgitant volume > 30 mL) depends on LV size and on the LV-LA pressure gradient, and specify the quantification method (2D, PISA, planimetry, volumetric).125

# Mitral Subvalvular Apparatus and LV Systolic Function

Originally proposed by Lillehei and colleagues in 1964, the mitral subvalvular apparatus (or valvular-ventricular complex) including chordal and papillary muscle function is important for optimal postoperative LV geometry and systolic pump function. 101-104,166,167,263-267 After mitral valve replacement with total chordal excision in the experimental and clinical settings, LV performance declines along with depression of regional and global LV elastance, dyssynergy of contraction, and dyskinesia at the papillary muscle insertion sites. Conversely, valve replacement with total or partial chordal preservation maintains LV contractile function. 101-103,183,267 Mitral valve replacement with chordal division is associated with reduced rest and exercise LVEF owing in part to an increase in LV ESS.<sup>266</sup> Mitral valve repair does not perturb rest and exercise ejection indexes of LV function primarily as a consequence of reducing ESS and maintaining a more ellipsoidal chamber geometry. Mitral valve replacement with complete chordal transection results in no postoperative change in LV enddiastolic volume, an increase in LVESV, an increase in ESS, and a decrease in ejection fraction.<sup>265</sup> Patients who undergo chordal-sparing valve replacement, on the other hand, have a smaller LV end-diastolic volume and LVESV, decreased ESS, and unchanged ejection fraction. These findings suggest that smaller chamber size, reduced systolic afterload, and preservation of ventricular contractile function act in concert to maintain ejection performance after chordal-sparing mitral valve replacement. In contrast, increased LV chamber size, increased systolic afterload, and probable reduction in LV contractile function leading to reduced ejection performance occur in patients who undergo valve replacement with chordal transaction.<sup>265</sup>

The loss of LV systolic function after mitral valve replacement with chordal division may be caused by heterogeneity of regional LV wall stress and not local depression of regional

Measurements are depicted on echocardiographic image of the mitral valve in apical four-chamber view in mid-systole. The basal mitral anterior leaflet angle is defined as the angle between the annular plane and the basal portion of the anterior leaflet. The distal mitral anterior leaflet angle is defined as the angle between the annular plane and the anterior leaflet tip distance (which corresponds to the distance between the medial part of the mitral annulus and the coaptation point). The posterior mitral leaflet angle is defined as the angle between the annular plane and the posterior leaflet.

contractile function.<sup>268</sup> After valve replacement with chordal transection in an experimental model, outward displacement of the ventricular wall and transverse shearing deformation occurred in the LV region papillary muscle insertion during isovolumic contraction. 268 Circumferential and radial strains during ejection were maintained at the basal LV site and enhanced in the apical LV site. Chordal transection augmented regional myocardial loading at the papillary muscle insertion site; the resulting heterogeneity of regional systolic function might be the mechanism for reduced global LV function and slowed ventricular relaxation. Anterior chordal transection with mitral valve replacement caused impaired regional LV function and also impaired regional right ventricular function,<sup>269</sup> whereas radionuclide angiography before and after mitral valve repair showed that LVEF did not change and right ventricular ejection fraction improved. In the region of the anterolateral papillary muscle insertion, local LV contractile function deteriorated after valve replacement with chordal transection, and right ventricular apicoseptal region was similarly impaired.<sup>269</sup>

In patients with chronic IMR, surgical division of the second-order chordae subtending the infarcted wall (usually those originating from the posteromedial papillary muscle) has been proposed to treat IMR by reducing leaflet tethering. <sup>270-272</sup> It is postulated that if the apical systolic tethering is eliminated, the normal redundancy of the mitral leaflet area creates better coaptation with the intact first-order

or marginal chordae preventing leaflet prolapse. Clinically, the Toronto group compared the outcomes of patients who underwent chordal-cutting mitral valve repair (n = 43) and those undergoing conventional mitral valve repair (n = 49)for IMR.<sup>271</sup> The reduction in tenting height before-to-after repair was similar in the two groups of patients, but those undergoing chordal cutting had a greater reduction in tenting area. The chordal-cutting group also had greater mobility of the anterior leaflet, as measured by a reduction in the distance between the free edge of the anterior mitral valve leaflet and the posterior LV wall. Additionally, those undergoing conventional mitral valve repair had a higher incidence of recurrent mitral regurgitation during 2 years of follow-up.<sup>271</sup> Chordal cutting did not adversely affect postoperative LVEF (10% relative increase in EF compared with 11% in the control group). The authors proposed that chordal cutting improves mitral valve leaflet mobility and reduces mitral regurgitation recurrence in patients with IMR, without any obvious deleterious effects on LV function.<sup>271</sup> It is known, however, that division of the chordae, especially the second-order or "strut" chordae, can impair LV systolic function. 273,274 Dividing the second-order chordae in an experimental acute ovine preparation caused regional LV systolic dysfunction near the chordal insertion sites and neither prevents nor decreases the severity of acute IMR, septal-lateral annular dilatation, leaflet tenting area, or leaflet tenting volume.<sup>273</sup> Cutting the anterior mitral leaflet second-order chordae alters LV chamber long-axis and

subvalvular geometry, remodels end-diastolic transmural myocardial architecture in the equatorial lateral LV region, perturbs systolic transmural LV wall-thickening mechanics (thereby decreasing subendocardial "microtorsion") and wall thickening, changes systolic temporal dynamics with delayed ejection, and impairs global LV systolic function (decreased end-systolic elastance and PRSW).<sup>274</sup> Because of the importance of the chordae for LV structure and function, we believe that caution is necessary when considering procedures that cut second-order chordae to treat patients with IMR because of the resulting compromise in LV systolic function in ventricles that are already impaired.<sup>273,274</sup>

# **Summary**

The functional competence of the mitral valve relies on the interaction of the mitral annulus and leaflets, chordae tendineae, papillary muscles, left atrium, and left ventricle. Dysfunction of any one or more components of this valvuloventricular complex can lead to mitral regurgitation. Important causes of mitral regurgitation include myxomatous degeneration and prolapse (primary mitral regurgitation) due to fibroelastic deficiency in older patients or Barlow's disease in younger subjects, ischemic heart disease with IMR (secondary mitral regurgitation), dilated cardiomyopathy leading to FMR (secondary mitral regurgitation), rheumatic valve disease, mitral annular calcification, and infective endocarditis. Four structural changes of the mitral valve apparatus may produce regurgitation: leaflet retraction from fibrosis and calcification, annular dilatation, chordal abnormalities, and LV systolic dysfunction with or without papillary muscle involvement. In IMR, changes in global and regional LV function and geometry, alterations in mitral annular geometry, abnormal leaflet (Carpentier type IIIb) motion, leaflet malcoaptation, increased interpapillary distance, and papillary muscle lateral displacement and malalignment all may result in apical tenting of the leaflets and mitral incompetence.

With mitral regurgitation, the impedance to LV emptying is lower because the mitral orifice is parallel with the LV outflow tract. Reduced LV impedance allows a greater proportion of contractile energy to be expended in myocardial fiber shortening than in tension development. After the initial compensatory phase, LV contractility becomes progressively more impaired with chronic mitral regurgitation and chronic LV volume overload. Importantly, because of the low impedance during systole, clinical indexes of systolic function, such as ejection fraction, can be normal even if depressed LV contractility is already present. LVESV is less dependent on preload than is ejection fraction and is a better measure of LV contractile reserve. Preoperative LVESV is a good predictor of postoperative outcome. Surgical mitral valve repair (or, if repair is judged not to be durable, mitral valve replacement with total chordal preservation) for chronic mitral regurgitation can preserve LV contractility, particularly in patients with a normal preoperative ejection fraction who have minimal ventricular dilatation and those without major coronary disease. In patients with impaired preoperative LV contractility,

LV systolic function may not necessarily improve after ring annuloplasty and definitely will not improve if the subvalvular apparatus and chordae are divided during mitral valve replacement.

IMR is generally associated with a higher operative risk than is nonischemic chronic mitral regurgitation. In patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and mild mitral regurgitation, isolated coronary artery bypass grafting may suffice if the LV inferior wall is still viable. Other argue that coronary revascularization alone in the setting of moderate IMR leaves many patients with substantial residual mitral regurgitation, heart failure symptoms, and a grave prognosis. Because moderate IMR does not resolve reliably with coronary revascularization alone, valve repair should be considered because it can reduce complications and possibly improve long-term survival. Survival after mitral valve surgery and coronary artery bypass grafting is more determined by the extent of coronary artery disease and severity of preoperative LV dysfunction than by the etiology of mitral regurgitation. Because mitral regurgitation is only one component of the disease, the appropriate management of patients with IMR is complicated, since adverse outcomes are associated with lesser degrees of mitral regurgitation (a smaller ERO threshold than those with primary mitral regurgitation). The 2014 ACC/AHA practice guidelines present clinical challenges because 2D and 3D echocardiography may generate disparate findings of ERO and regurgitant volume, and the nature of secondary mitral regurgitation may be dynamic depending on loading conditions and after revascularization or resynchronization. In managing these patients, an integrated approach has been proposed that is based on clinical judgment and that incorporates multiple Doppler parameters without relying on any single parameter.
