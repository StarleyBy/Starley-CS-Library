# Mitral valve disease

### 1 **What is the natural history of mitral regurgitation (MR)?**

- Asymptomatic patients can have a long latent period before the onset of symptoms as chronic MR is well tolerated if left ventricular function is well preserved.
- Deterioration in left ventricular function, however, is masked by the unloading effect of a leaking valve resulting in a pseudo-normal left ventricular ejection fraction (EF).
- Poor prognostic features of MR include:
  - a) symptoms for >1 year;
  - b) atrial fibrillation;
  - c) age >60 yr;
  - d) EF <50%;
  - e) left ventricular end-diastolic volume >100mL/m2, left ventricular end-systolic volume >60mL/m2;
  - f) left ventricular end-systolic diameter >5cm, left ventricular enddiastolic diameter >7cm.

### 2 **What is the pathophysiology of mitral regurgitation?**

- Chronic left ventricular volume overload associated with MR leads to eccentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle.
- Stroke volume is initially maintained by the Frank-Starling mechanism.
- Eventually left ventricular contractile function declines producing increased left ventricular end-systolic volume, raised left ventricular filling pressures, and raised left atrial and pulmonary venous pressures, finally resulting in pulmonary oedema and congestive heart failure.
- Once the left ventricular ejection fraction falls below approximately 60%, left ventricular systolic dysfunction is almost certainly present as some of the ejected volume flows into the left atrium (afterloadreducing effect of MR).

#### 3 How is mitral regurgitation classified?

- According to Carpentier's functional classification (Figure 1):
  - a) Type I: normal leaflet motion, e.g. annular dilation, leaflet perforation;
  - b) Type II: excess leaflet motion, e.g. myxomatous degeneration, chordal rupture;
  - c) Type III: restricted leaflet motion:
    - i) Illa: restricted opening, e.g. rheumatic fever;
    - ii) IIIb: restricted closure, e.g. ischaemic cardiomyopathy.

Figure 1. Carpentier's functional classification of mitral regurgitation. A) Type I - normal leaflet motion usually producing central regurgitation. B) Type II - excessive leaflet motion above the annular plane usually producing eccentric regurgitation. C) Type III - restricted leaflet motion below the annular plane usually producing eccentric regurgitation.

#### 4 What are the causes of chronic mitral regurgitation?

- Myxomatous degeneration (Type II).
- Rheumatic fever (Type IIIa).
- Ischaemic cardiomyopathy (mainly Type IIIb and Type I, see below).

### 5 What are the causes of acute mitral regurgitation?

- Chordal rupture (Type II).
- Infective endocarditis (Type I).
- Papillary muscle rupture (following myocardial infarction, Type II)(Figure 2).

![](_page_2_Picture_2.jpeg)

Figure 2. Papillary muscle rupture following acute myocardial infarction

#### 6 What is the aetiology of ischaemic mitral regurgitation?

- Acute ischaemic MR is usually caused by infarcted, ruptured or nonruptured papillary muscle (Type II).
- Chronic ischaemic MR is caused by a combination of restricted movement of P2 and P3 scallops of the posterior mitral valve (MV) leaflet due to left ventricular dilation displacing the papillary muscles (Type IIIb) and functional dilation of the MV annulus (Type I).
- In addition, reduced contraction of the MV annulus and reduced ventricular closing forces on the MV due to poor LV function contribute to ischaemic MR.

#### 7 What are the symptoms of mitral regurgitation?

- Mitral regurgitation is a progressive disease and hence patients can be asymptomatic for many years.
- Fatigue and weakness related to low cardiac output.
- Dyspnoea, orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea.
- Eventually patients may develop pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure.

#### 8 What are the signs of mitral regurgitation?

- Displaced volume-loaded apex beat.
- Apical thrill.
- 3rd heart sound.
- Apical pansystolic murmur radiating to the axilla (the intensity of the murmur does not necessarily correlate with the severity of MR).

- Apical diastolic flow murmur (due to increased flow across the MV in diastole).
- Right ventricular heave and an increased pulmonary component of the 2nd heart sound (if pulmonary hypertension is present).

#### 9 **How is mitral regurgitation quantified echocardiographically?**

• According to the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, there are five main criteria (Table 1).

|                                             | Mild | Moderate | Severe |
|---------------------------------------------|------|----------|--------|
| Jet area (% LA area)                        | <20% | 20-40%   | >40%   |
| Vena contracta (cm)                         | <0.3 | 0.3-0.7  | >0.7   |
| Regurgitant volume (mL)                     | <30  |    | >60    |
| Regurgitant fraction (%)                    | <30  |    | >50    |
| Effective regurgitant<br>orifice area (cm2) | <0.2 | 0.2-0.4  | >0.4   |

- Information regarding the left atrial size, valve morphology, flow reversal in the pulmonary veins, the underlying aetiology of MR, and changes in left ventricular function and size are also important when assessing the severity of MR.
- For ischaemic MR, regurgitant volume >30mL and an effective regurgitant orifice area >0.2cm2 are considered severe.
- Vena contracta refers to the narrowest part of the regurgitant jet just after the valve orifice.

#### 10 **What are the indications for mitral valve surgery in patients with mitral regurgitation?**

#### *AHA guidelines*

- Class I: severe MR with symptoms (NYHA II-IV) or left ventricular changes (end-systolic diameter >40mm or EF <60%).
- Class IIa: severe MR in an asymptomatic patient with good LV function and size, where the likelihood of repair in the operating centre is >90%.

- Class IIa: severe MR with AF or pulmonary hypertension (>50mmHg at rest or 60mmHg with exercise).
- Class IIb: severe MR, poor left ventricular function (EF <30%) and symptoms (NYHA III-IV) despite maximal anti-failure medical therapy and biventricular pacing.

#### 11 **When should transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) be performed in patients with severe mitral regurgitation?**

#### *AHA guidelines*

- Class I: intra-operative TOE, pre-bypass to assess the feasibility of repair and post-bypass to assess the success of the repair.
- Class IIa: pre-operative TOE to guide whether asymptomatic patients have a >90% chance of repair (see AHA guidelines on MR).

# 12 **What is mitral valve prolapse due to Barlow's disease?**

- Mitral valve prolapse is defined as >2mm billowing of the anterior or posterior mitral valve leaflet beyond the annular plane into the left atrium with or without MR.
- It can be familial or non-familial and may be associated with Marfan syndrome.
- Histological analysis reveals marked myxomatous proliferation of acid mucopolysaccharides within the zona spongiosa of the mitral valve leaflets, resulting in thinning and elongation of the chordae tendinae.
- Patients with mitral valve prolapse can be asymptomatic or present with severe MR or arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia).
- Surgery is indicated as per AHA guidelines for non-ischaemic MR.

### 13 **What is the natural history of mitral stenosis (MS)?**

- Patients usually become symptomatic on exertion when the mitral valve area (MVA) becomes <2.5cm2 and symptomatic at rest when the MVA becomes <1.5cm2.
- The natural progression of MS causes the mitral valve area to reduce by 0.1-0.3cm2 per year.
- The progression from onset of rheumatic fever to onset of signs of MS takes years.
- The progression from signs of MS to mild symptoms of MS takes 10- 20 years.

- The progression from mild symptoms of MS to decompensation (often precipitated by AF) takes years.
- The 10-year survival is 80% (in patients with NYHA I/II symptoms) and 10-15% (in patients with NYHA III/IV symptoms).
- In patients with pulmonary hypertension (>50mmHg), the mean survival is 3 years.

### 14 **What is the pathophysiology of mitral stenosis?**

- Restricted left ventricular inflow results in increased left atrial pressure; back pressure on the pulmonary circulation causes dyspnoea and eventually pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure and subsequent left ventricular failure.
- Pulmonary hypertension occurs secondary to compensatory vasoconstriction and hypertrophy of the pulmonary arterioles.
- The patient's haemodynamic state is worsened by tachycardia or atrial fibrillation which reduces the diastolic filling period.

### 15 **What are the causes of mitral stenosis?**

- The majority of cases are caused by rheumatic fever (Lancefield group A b-haemolytic Streptococcus)(Figure 3).
- Very rare causes include a congenital parachute mitral valve, endocardial fibroelastosis and carcinoid syndrome.
- The pathophysiology of MS can also be caused by cor triatriatum, left atrial myxoma and pulmonary vein stenosis.

**Figure 3. Rheumatic mitral stenosis.**

#### 16 What are the symptoms of mitral stenosis?

- Mitral stenosis has a long latent period and therefore can be asymptomatic for many years.
- Fatigue.
- Dyspnoea, orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea.
- Left atrial distension resulting in:
  - a) atrial fibrillation and subsequent thrombo-embolic events;
  - b) left recurrent laryngeal nerve compression presenting with hoarseness (Ortner's syndrome);
  - c) oesophageal compression producing dysphagia;
  - d) rarely, left main bronchus compression causing left lung collapse.
- Pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure which present as:
  - a) peripheral oedema and ascites;
  - b) haemoptysis due to distension and rupture of bronchial veins.

#### 17 What are the signs of mitral stenosis?

- Low volume pulse.
- Irregular pulse.
- Tapping non-displaced apex beat.
- Opening snap.
- Loud S1 heart sound.
- Mid-diastolic rumbling murmur loudest at the apex.
- Pulmonary hypertension:
  - a) mitral facies;
  - b) central cyanosis;
  - c) loud P2 heart sound;
  - d) tricuspid regurgitation pan-systolic murmur at the right sternal edge;
  - e) pulmonary regurgitation Graham Steel early diastolic murmur on inspiration.

### 18 **How is mitral stenosis quantified?**

• According to the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, there are three main criteria:

| Table 2. AHA guidelines for the severity of mitral stenosis. |            |                 |             |  |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------|-------------|--|
|                                                              | Mild       | Moderate        | Severe      |  |
| Mitral valve area (cm2)<br>Mean pressure gradient<br>(mmHg)  | >1.5<br><5 | 1.0-1.5<br>5-10 | <1.0<br>>10 |  |
| Pulmonary artery systolic<br>pressure (mmHg)                 | <30        |           | >50         |  |

- The mitral valve area (MVA) can be calculated by:
  - a) planimetry: short axis mitral valve on 2D echocardiography;
  - b) pressure half-time (PHT) equation: MVA = 220 PHT
    - where MVA = mitral valve area, PHT = pressure half-time;
  - c) continuity equation: MVA = AreaLVOT x VTILVOT VTIMV where LVOT = left ventricular outflow tract, VTI = velocity time integral, MV = mitral valve;
  - d) Gorlin equation: MVA = CO 38 x HR x DFP x Ömean gradient where CO = cardiac output, HR = heart rate, DFP = diastolic filling period.
- Information regarding the left atrial size, valve morphology, presence of left atrial thrombus, underlying aetiology of MS, and changes in left ventricular function and size are also important when assessing the severity of mitral stenosis.
- 19 **What are the indications for mitral valve surgery in patients with mitral stenosis?**

#### *AHA guidelines*

• Class I: moderate-severe MS with symptoms (NYHA III-IV) where percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty (PMBV) is not suitable (see below).

- Class IIa: severe MS with severe pulmonary hypertension (>50mmHg) or symptoms (NYHA I-II) where PMBV is not suitable.
- Class IIb: moderate-severe MS with recurrent embolic events on anticoagulation.

#### 20 **What are the determinants of the Wilkins mitral stenosis score (Figure 4)?**

- Leaflet mobility, leaflet thickening, leaflet calcification and subvalvular thickening.
- Each scores between, with a maximum score of 16.
- A Wilkins score >9 suggests the lesion is unlikely to be amenable to PMBV.

![](_page_8_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Figure 4. Thickening of the mitral valve leaflet and sub-valvular apparatus, associated with mitral stenosis.**

#### 21 **What are the indications for percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty (PMBV) in patients with mitral stenosis?**

#### *AHA guidelines*

• Class I: moderate-severe MS with either symptoms (NYHA II-IV) or pulmonary hypertension (>50mmHg at rest or 60mmHg on exercise). • Class IIa: moderate-severe MS with symptoms (NYHA III-IV) in patients with a non-pliable valve or in patients who are at a high surgical risk of death.

PMBV should be only performed in patients with favourable valve morphology (Wilkins score of 8 or less) and no contraindications (left atrial thrombus, moderate-severe MR).

#### 22 **How is percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty (PMBV) performed?**

- Using Iocal anaesthetic and sedation, a valvuloplasty balloon is passed via the femoral vein into the right atrium, across the intra-atrial septum, into the left atrium, across the mitral valve and inflated (Figure 5).
- Results are best when the leaflets are thin, mobile, not calcified, in the younger age group and where the subvalvular chordae have not fused/calcified.

![](_page_9_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Figure 5. Percutaneous trans-septal mitral balloon valvuloplasty. The femoral vein is accessed using 9-11Fr sheaths. A) The coiled tip guide wire is then advanced into the left ventricle, via the right atrium, interatrial septum, left atrium and mitral valve. B) A valvuloplasty balloon (Jomiva™, Numed, Hopkinton, New York, USA or Inoue-Balloon™, Toray International America Inc., Houston, USA) is advanced into the mitral valve orifice using transoesophageal echocardiography and fluoroscopy guidance. C) The balloon is then progressively inflated with controlled hydraulic pressure, until a satisfactory diameter is reached. D) Following completion, the balloon is deflated and the mitral valve function is assessed.** 

- PMBV typically increases the mitral valve area from 1 to 2cm2.
- Complications include mortality 1%, cardiac perforation 1%, stroke 2% and severe MR 3%.

# 23 **How is a closed mitral valvotomy performed?**

• Following a left posterolateral thoracotomy, the pericardium is opened anterior to the phrenic nerve. An index finger is then inserted into the left atrium and a Tubbs dilator is passed via the apex through the left ventricle, using purse strings to reduce blood loss and air embolism. The dilator is then guided manually through the mitral valve orifice and opened along the natural inter-commissural line. The resulting dilation is assessed manually and by transoesophageal echocardiography (Figure 6).

![](_page_10_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Figure 6. Closed mitral valvotomy.**

#### 24 **What are the surgical approaches to the mitral valve (Figure 7)?**

- Standard left atriotomy:
  - a) the pericardial reflections around the inferior and superior pulmonary veins are mobilised;
  - b) Waterson's interatrial groove is developed thereby reflecting the right atrium back over the left atrium;
  - c) an incision is then made in the left atrium anterior and medial to the right superior pulmonary vein and continued inferiorly.
- Bi-atrial trans-septal incision, where an oblique incision from the right atrial free wall through the right atrial appendage and down to the left atrial roof, is joined by a second incision (dashed red line) through the fossa ovalis, medial to the crista terminalis, from the Eustachian valve to the edge of the superior limbus. The sino-atrial nodal artery is at risk during this incision.
- Superior roof incision, where an incision is made across the right atrial free wall and continued between the superior vena cava and the right atrial appendage. From there, it is extended across the interatrial septum and the roof of the left atrium passing behind the aortic root towards the commissure between the left coronary cusp and the noncoronary cusp. There is a risk of damage to the left main coronary artery, non-coronary sinus of the aorta and superior vena cava.
- Bi-atrial (Dubost) incision, where a vertical incision is made between the right superior and inferior pulmonary veins, which extends across

**Figure 7. Surgical approaches to the mitral valve. A) Standard left atriotomy. B) Bi-atrial vertical trans-septal incision. C) Superior roof incision. D) Bi-atrial Dubost incision. SVC = superior vena cava; IVC = inferior vena cava; RA = right atrium; RPVs = right pulmonary veins.**

- the left atrium, right atrium and interatrial septum. It allows good access but can be difficult to close.
- Right anterolateral thoracotomy, which is used for minimal access or redo surgery.

## 25 **How is the mitral valve assessed intra-operatively?**

- The valve is inspected using nerve hooks to measure the degree of motion of each scallop (P1, P2, P3, A1, A2, A3) of both leaflets compared against a reference point (usually P1 or the anterolateral commissure).
- The valve competency can be checked before repair by distending the left ventricle with cold saline and identifying the aetiology and location of the regurgitation jet.
- Competence of the valve following repair is assessed by:
  - a) static testing under direct vision by distending the left ventricle with cold saline;
  - b) TOE with an appropriately filled left ventricle off cardiopulmonary bypass support.

#### 26 **What structures are at risk during mitral valve surgery (Figure 8)?**

![](_page_12_Picture_11.jpeg)

**Figure 8. Anatomical relations of the mitral valve. AMVL = anterior mitral valve leaflet; PMVL = posterior mitral valve leaflet; LCC = left coronary cusp of the aortic valve; NCC = non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve.**

- Circumflex coronary artery.
- Coronary sinus.
- Aortic valve (left and non-coronary cusps).
- Atrioventricular node and conducting bundles.

# 27 What is systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve?

- Systolic anterior motion occurs when the tips of the mitral valve leaflets are displaced anteriorly into the left ventricular outflow tract. This results in a Venturi effect pulling on the mitral valve leaflets causing MR and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. In comparison, during diastole the left ventricular outflow diameter is normal (Figure 9).
- SAM is more common in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and small elderly women with asymmetric septal hypertrophy.

![](_page_13_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Figure 9.** Systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve. LVOTd = left ventricular outflow tract in diastole; LVOTs = left ventricular outflow tract in systole.

# 28 How is systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve prevented?

 The risk of SAM can be reduced by avoiding excess anterior mitral valve leaflet tissue or excess height of the posterior mitral valve leaflet

- (>1.5cm), as this will cause the line of leaflet coaptation to be displaced anteriorly into the left ventricular outflow tract.
- SAM is exacerbated by hypovolaemia, excess inotropes and tachycardia.

#### 29 **How is systolic anterior motion (SAM) post-mitral valve repair treated?**

- Conservative ensure adequate volume status, increase afterload, reduce tachycardia, reduce inotropes.
- Surgical (Figure 10) remove the annuloplasty ring then consider:
  - a) sliding annuloplasty to reduce the height of the posterior mitral valve leaflet;
  - b) implanting an incomplete mitral annuloplasty ring (e.g. Cosgrove® or Duran®);
  - c) increasing the size, particularly the anteroposterior (AP) diameter, of the mitral annuloplasty ring;
  - d) implanting a low profile prosthetic mitral valve (e.g. St Jude® mechanical prosthesis).

![](_page_14_Picture_11.jpeg)

**Figure 10. Surgical management of systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve includes implanting a larger annuloplasty ring or implanting an annuloplasty band.**

#### 30 **What are the surgical treatment options for diseases of the mitral valve?**

• Posterior MVL prolapse (Figures 11 and 12A): quadrangular or triangular resection, sliding annuloplasty, artificial chord implantation.

![](_page_15_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 11. Surgical options for prolapse of the P2 segment of the posterior mitral valve leaflet include quadrangular resection (left image) or triangular resection (right image). This is followed by reattaching the P1 and P3 segments and implantation of an annuloplasty ring.**

- Anterior MVL prolapse (Figure 12B): triangular resection, artificial chord implantation.
- Bileaflet MV prolapse: leaflet resection, artificial chord implantation, Alfieri stitch, MV replacement.
- Partial papillary muscle rupture: reimplantation of the papillary muscle.
- Complete papillary muscle rupture: MV replacement.

A) Posterior mitral valve leaflet prolapse treated by triangular resection of the P2 segment, implantation of Gore-Tex® neochordae and ring annuloplasty. B) Anterior mitral valve leaflet prolapse treated by implantation of Gore-Tex® neochordae and ring annuloplasty. AMVL = anterior mitral valve leaflet; PMVL = posterior mitral valve leaflet.**

- Leaflet perforation: bovine pericardial patch.
- Annular dilation: complete flexible annuloplasty ring (e.g. Physio<sup>®</sup>)
- Ischaemic MR: McCarthy-Adams IMR® ring, downsizing annuloplasty, MV replacement.
- Rheumatic MS: MV replacement.

# 31 When is a sliding annuloplasty used in addition to a simple quadrangular resection (Figure 13)?

- Following excessive posterior mitral valve leaflet resection.
- To reduce the risk of SAM (where the posterior mitral valve leaflet height is greater than 1.5cm or there is a long anterior mitral valve leaflet).

![](_page_17_Picture_9.jpeg)

Figure 13. Posterior mitral valve leaflet repair with quadrangular resection and sliding annuloplasty. Quadrangular resection of the P2 segment is followed by partially detaching the P1 and P3 segments from the posterior mitral valve annulus. The repair is completed by reattaching the P1 and P3 segments to each other and then to the posterior annulus, thereby decreasing the height of the posterior leaflet. The repair procedure is completed with implantation of an annuloplasty ring.

#### 32 What are the benefits of a mitral annuloplasty ring?

- Corrects annular dilation.
- Prevents further annular dilation.
- Increases leaflet coaptation.
- Reinforces annular suture lines.

# 33 What are the features of each of the different mitral valve ring prostheses (Figure 14)?

- Carpentier-McCarthy-Adams IMR ETlogix Annuloplasty Ring<sup>®</sup> for ischaemic MR.
- Cosgrove-Edwards Annuloplasty System<sup>®</sup> (incomplete, flexible) when concerned about SAM (with excess anterior mitral valve leaflet
  height in comparison to the intercommissural distance, as an
  incomplete ring does not fix the anterior mitral valve leaflet).

- Carpentier-Edwards Physio Annuloplasty Ring<sup>®</sup> (complete, semiflexible) - frequently used annuloplasty ring.
- Carpentier ring<sup>®</sup> (rigid, complete) where the AP diameter can be adjusted for a bespoke ring shape.

# 34 What are the advantages of repairing the mitral valve rather than replacing it?

- As compared with mitral valve replacement, mitral valve repair is associated with greater freedom from mortality (operative and longterm), structural valve deterioration, re-operation, infective endocarditis, thrombo-embolism and haemorrhage.
- As more of the sub-valvular apparatus is preserved, mitral valve repair is better at maintaining left ventricular geometry and hence is associated with less left ventricular dysfunction compared with mitral valve replacement.

# 35 Describe the therapeutic options for ischaemic mitral regurgitation

- Coronary artery bypass grafting.
- Implantation of a mitral valve annuloplasty ring (McCarthy-Adams IMR ring<sup>®</sup>), which is specifically designed with a reduced anterior-posterior diameter and a concavity in the region of the P2/P3 scallops.
- Downsizing annuloplasty of the mitral valve.
- Mitral valve replacement.

# 36 What is the freedom from re-intervention for patients older than 70 years for the different mitral valve prostheses and repair techniques available?

- Repair of anterior mitral valve leaflet 78% at 10 years.
- Repair of posterior mitral valve leaflet 98% at 10 years.
- Open mitral valve commissurotomy 80% at 10 years.
- Closed mitral valve commissurotomy 70% at 10 years.
- Percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty 80% at 10 years.
- Porcine bioprosthesis 75% at 10 years.
- Bovine pericardial bioprosthesis 80% at 10 years.
- Mechanical prosthesis 98% at 10 years.

# 37 How is atrioventricular disruption following mitral valve replacement treated?

- Put the patient back on cardiopulmonary bypass.
- Remove the prosthetic valve.
- Implant a bovine pericardial patch across the atrioventricular groove.
- Implant a smaller prosthetic valve with a low profile.
- Avoid lifting the heart with the prosthesis in situ.
