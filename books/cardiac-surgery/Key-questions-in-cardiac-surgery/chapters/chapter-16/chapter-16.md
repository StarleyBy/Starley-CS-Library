### Thoracic aortic disease

1 **What are the normal dimensions of the thoracic aorta (Figure 1)?**

![](_page_0_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 1. Normal dimensions of the thoracic aorta.**

• An aneurysm is defined as permanent localised dilation of an artery (³150% diameter of the normal calibre).

#### 2 **Describe the anatomical layers of the thoracic aorta (Figure 2)**

- The intima (inner layer of the aorta) consists of endothelial cells, a subendothelial layer of connective tissue and an elastic membrane.
- The media (middle layer of the aorta) consists of elastin, collagen, smooth muscle cells and ground matrix.
- The adventitia (strong outer covering of the aorta) consists of connective tissue, collagen and elastic fibres.

**Figure 2. Histological layers of the thoracic aorta.**

#### 3 How are a ortic aneurysms classified (Figure 3)?

- Pathology:
  - a) true aneurysm, which is caused by outpouching of all three layers of the vessel wall (Figure 3A);
  - b) false aneurysm (pseudoaneurysm), which consists of thrombus contained by adventitia and surrounding tissues (Figure 3B).
- Shape saccular (Figure 3C) or fusiform (Figure 3D).
- Aetiology atherosclerotic, dissecting or mycotic.
- Location ascending, arch or descending (Figure 4).

**Figure 4. A) Ascending aortic aneurysm. Asc Ao = ascending aorta; PA = pulmonary artery; RV = right ventricle. B) Descending thoracic aortic aneurysm, viewed through a double left thoracotomy, with the majority of the aneurysm lying beneath the adherent left lung. The intercostal arteries can be seen branching posteriorly (left panel, lower thoracotomy) with the left recurrent laryngeal nerve passing over the aortic arch (right panel, upper thoracotomy).** 

### 4 Describe Crawford's classification of thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysms (Figure 5)

![](_page_4_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Figure 5.** Crawford's classification of thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysms.

- I: most of the descending thoracic aorta (just beyond the left subclavian artery to the suprarenal abdominal aorta).
- II: just beyond the left subclavian artery to the infrarenal abdominal aorta.
- III: lower descending aorta (below the 6th rib) into the abdomen.
- IV: below the diaphragm, i.e. an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
- V: mid-descending thoracic aorta to above the diaphragm (new addition to the classification).

#### 5 What is the natural history of thoracic aortic aneurysms?

- Surgically untreated thoracic aortic aneurysms carry the risk of rupture, dissection and death.
- Expansion of thoracic aneurysms occurs at a faster rate in larger aneurysms (0.2cm per year in aneurysms <5cm compared to 0.8cm per year in aneurysms >5cm), as per Laplace's Law.
- The risk of rupture increases as the size of the aneurysm increases (0.3% per year for aneurysms 4-5cm compared to 3.6% for aneurysms >6cm).
- The median size for rupture is 6cm for ascending and 7cm for descending thoracic aortic aneurysms (Figure 6).

![](_page_5_Figure_2.jpeg)

**<sup>326</sup> Figure 6. Graph demonstrating the risk of rupture significantly increases when ascending and descending aortic diameters are larger than 6 and 7cm, respectively.** 

- The mean time from onset of symptoms to rupture of the aneurysm is 2 years.
- The 5-year survival of surgically untreated (symptomatic and asymptomatic) thoracic aortic aneurysms is 39% and thoracoabdominal aneurysms, 23%.

#### 6 **What is the pathophysiology of aortic aneurysm formation?**

- The media of the aorta normally contains elastin, collagen, smooth muscle cells and ground matrix.
- Aneurysms form after loss of smooth muscle cells and fragmentation of elastin fibres (a process known as cystic medial degeneration), which results in loss of elasticity and tensile strength of the media.
- The aorta normally expands and recoils with systole and diastole but dilates when elastic recoil is lost.

#### 7 **What are the predisposing factors for a thoracic aortic aneurysm?**

• A: age, atherosclerosis.

- B: bicuspid aortic valve (associated with fibrillin deficiency), blood pressure (hypertension).
- C: connective tissue disorders (Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome).
- D: dissection, degenerative (cystic medial degeneration).
- E: trauma, aortitis, infection, syphilis.

### 8 What are the independent risk factors for rupture of an aortic aneurysm?

- Aortic diameter.
- Pain or other symptoms of expansion.
- Age.
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- Smoking.

#### 9 What is Marfan syndrome (Figure 7)?

- Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition associated with mutation of the fibrillin gene on chromosome 15.
- As there are many different genetic mutations, it results in many different phenotypes.

![](_page_6_Picture_15.jpeg)

**Figure 7.** Computed tomography scan demonstrating a classical 'onion-shaped' aortic root aneurysm associated with Marfan syndrome.

- The diagnosis of Marfan syndrome is based on two or more of the following clinical features:
  - a) tall thin patient arm span greater than height;
  - b) arachnodactyly long tapered fingers;
  - c) high arched palate;
  - d) scoliosis, pectus excavatum or protusio acetabulae;
  - e) hypermobility of joints with skin laxity;
  - f) spontaneous pneumothorax with apical bullae;
  - g) eye signs ectopia lentis (upward dislocation of lens), myopia, retinal detachment;
  - h) floppy mitral valve resulting in mitral regurgitation and chordal rupture;
  - i) aortopathy with weakened aortic wall which dilates even in normotensive patients. This is caused by cystic medial necrosis and may result in a thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection.

#### 10 What is Ehlers-Danlos syndrome?

- Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition.
  - Type IV Ehlers-Danlos syndrome results in a structural defect of Type III collagen and subsequent aortopathy.
- It is less common than Marfan syndrome.

### What are the clinical features of patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms?

- Asymptomatic incidental finding on imaging.
- Pain anterior chest pain or back pain (typically intrascapular), with sudden onset of the pain suggesting dissection or impending rupture.
- Compression of nearby structures resulting in hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal nerve), dysphagia (oesophagus) and stridor or dyspnoea (trachea).
- Fistula resulting in haematemesis (oesophagus) or haemoptysis (lung, bronchi).

### 12 What are the indications for intervention on thoracic aortic aneurysms?

- Size:
  - a) ascending aortic aneurysms >5.5cm;
  - ascending aortic aneurysms >4.5cm for patients undergoing AVR or CABG;
  - c) ascending aortic aneurysms 4.0-5.0cm (or when the ratio of the maximal ascending or aortic root area  $(\pi r^2)$  in cm² divided

by the patient's height in metres exceeds 10) for patients with Marfan syndrome or other connective tissue disorders;

- d) aortic arch aneurysms >5.5cm;
- e) descending aortic aneurysms >5.5cm;
- f) thoraco-abdominal aneurysms >6.0cm.
- Symptoms of expansion, compression or fistula formation chest pain, back pain, dyspnoea, dysphagia, hoarseness, haematemesis or haemoptysis.
- Rapid rate of expansion >1cm/year.
- Recurrent emboli (especially cerebral emboli from the aortic arch).

### 13 What are the indications for an aortic root replacement?

- Annulo-aortic ectasia dilation of the aortic root, using similar size criteria for the ascending aorta (see above).
- Aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva (which occurs most frequently in the non-coronary sinus, then the right coronary sinus and least often in the left coronary sinus). In these patients, it may be possible to perform a selective sinus replacement, instead of a complete aortic root replacement.
- Aortic root abscess.
- Stanford Type A thoracic aortic dissection extending into the aortic root.
- Small aortic root if root-sparing techniques are not possible.

### 14 What are the principles of surgery when operating on aortic aneurysms?

- The aim of surgery is to prevent rupture, dissection, local compression and fistula formation.
- Surgery should be offered when the combined risk of operative mortality and permanent neurological deficit is less than the combined risk of rupture and dissection.
- Operative mortality is 2-5% for aortic root or ascending aortic surgery, 5-10% for aortic arch surgery and 10-20% for thoracoabdominal aortic surgery.
- Risk of neurological injury: 5-10% stroke; 5-10% paraplegia (for descending aortic replacement).

### 15 What is the 5-year survival following surgery for thoracic aortic aneurysms?

- Ascending aortic aneurysm 82%.
- Aortic arch aneurysm 70%.
- Descending aortic aneurysm 65%.

- Thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm 65%.
- As part of the long-term follow-up after thoracic aortic surgery, these patients need beta-blockade and annual radiological scanning (CT or MRI) to assess the residual native aorta.

#### 16 **What are the operative choices for an aortic root replacement (Figure 8)?**

- If the aortic root is dilated but the aortic valve is structurally normal, a valve-sparing procedure should be considered (e.g David or Yacoub procedure):
  - a) David reimplantation procedure: the commissural pillars are reimplanted within a Dacron® interposition tube graft and the coronary buttons are re-anastomosed. The sutures are passed from the left ventricular outflow tract from inside to out of the graft, thereby stabilising the aortic annulus. The Dacron® tube diameter is equal to the average length of the free margins of three leaflets (Figure 8A);
  - b) Yacoub remodelling procedure: the ascending aorta and sinuses are replaced with a Dacron® interposition tube graft that is scalloped to incorporate the aortic valve commissural pillars. The coronary buttons are then re-implanted. As the aortic valve annulus is not stabilised, this technique is not suitable for patients with connective tissue disorders or where the aortic valve annulus is dilated >30mm (Figure 8B).
- If the aortic root is dilated and the aortic valve diseased (e.g. stenotic), an aortic root and valve replacement is performed:
  - a) classic Bentall procedure (inclusion technique): a valved conduit is placed within the aneurysmal aortic root and flow to the coronary button is provided by holes within the prosthesis. This procedure is rarely used now (Figure 9A);
  - b) modified Bentall procedure: the aneurysmal aortic root is excised and replaced by a valved conduit (such as a Carboseal® mechanical prosthesis or BioValsalvaTM bioprosthesis) with reimplantation of the coronary buttons (Figure 9B).
- A Cabrol procedure may be used to avoid tension on the coronary reimplantation by using a prosthetic interposition graft (8mm Dacron® tube), such as when the coronary ostia are laterally displaced by a large aneurysm (Figure 9C).
- Homograft aortic root replacement: a cadaveric human aortic root is implanted followed by re-anastomosis of the coronary buttons. It is

**Figure 9. Aortic root surgery. A) Classic Bentall procedure. B) Modified Bentall procedure. C) Cabrol procedure. D) Aortic homograft implantation. E) Ross procedure.**

- often used in patients with an aortic root abscess following infective endocarditis of the aortic valve (Figure 9D).
- Ross procedure: the aortic root is replaced with the patient's own pulmonary trunk, which itself is replaced with a pulmonary homograft (Figure 9E).

#### 17 **What are the surgical options for the treatment of ascending aortic aneurysms (Figure 10)?**

- Ascending aortic replacement: a Dacron® interposition graft is implanted just distal to the sinotubular junction and proximal to the origin of the innominate artery.
- Reduction aortoplasty: the ascending aorta is incised along its greater curve, with or without excision of a section of the aortic wall, followed by a two-layered everting overlapping closure, supported by Teflon® strips.
- Supporting aortoplasty: a mesh of Gore-Tex® or Prolene® is wrapped around the ascending aorta and secured with adventitial stitches to avoid migration over the coronary ostia or the origin of the innominate artery.

#### 18 **What is acute aortic syndrome (Figure 11)?**

• It is defined as a group of life-threatening thoracic aortic pathologies that includes aortic dissection, penetrating aortic ulcer, intramural haematoma and leaking aortic aneurysm.

![](_page_12_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 10. Surgical options for the treatment of ascending aortic aneurysms. A) Ascending aortic replacement. B) Reduction aortoplasty. C) Supporting aortoplasty using a Prolene mesh® (arrow).**

![](_page_12_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 11. Acute aortic syndrome. A) Intramural haematoma. B) Penetrating aortic ulcer. C) Aortic dissection.**

- Management of patients with acute aortic syndrome should be similar to those with acute thoracic aortic dissection:
  - a) ascending aorta surgery;
  - b) descending aorta medical management but stenting or surgery should be considered in patients with impending rupture, unremitting pain or organ malperfusion.

#### 19 **What is an intramural haematoma of the aorta (Figure 12)?**

- It is defined as blood within the aortic media without the presence of an intimal tear.
- Aetiology:
  - a) rupture of the vasa vasorum of the media;
  - b) haemorrhage within an atherosclerotic plaque;
  - c) progression from a penetrating aortic ulcer.
- It may resolve spontaneously or progress and increase in size.
- Unlike dissections, intramural haematomas occur closer to the adventitia and hence are at a greater risk of rupture than dissections.

![](_page_13_Picture_13.jpeg)

**Figure 12. Intramural haematoma (arrows) of the ascending aorta demonstrated on A) axial and B) sagittal computed tomography scans.** 

#### 20 **What are penetrating aortic ulcers (Figure 13)?**

- They are defined as focal intimal defects occurring at the site of atherosclerotic plaques.
- Progressive intimal erosion eventually results in pulsatile blood entering the media and hence penetrating ulcers may lead to intramural haematomas, dissection, and rupture, as well as pseudoaneurysm and aneurysm formation.
- Surgery is indicated for patients with:
  - a) descending aortic ulcers with a diameter >20mm and depth >10mm;
  - b) ascending aortic ulcers.

![](_page_14_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Figure 13. Penetrating aortic ulcers (PAU) observed in the A) right coronary sinus of the aortic root and B) lesser curve of the aortic arch.**

#### 21 **How are thoracic aortic dissections classified (Figure 14)?**

- Aortic dissection is defined as an intimal tear resulting in a split in the aortic wall between the internal and external elastic laminae within the media.
- Timing:
  - a) acute (<14 days);
  - b) sub-acute (14 days 2 months);
  - c) chronic (>2 months).

#### • Location:

- a) Stanford classification:
  - i) Type A: ascending aorta involved;
  - ii) Type B: ascending aorta not involved;
- b) DeBakey classification:
  - i) Type I: whole aorta involved;
  - ii) Type II: only ascending aorta involved;
  - iii) Type IIIa: only descending aorta involved;
  - iv) Type IIIb: descending and abdominal aorta involved.

![](_page_15_Picture_11.jpeg)

**Figure 14. DeBakey and Stanford classifications of thoracic aortic dissection.**

#### 22 **Describe the pathophysiology of a thoracic aortic dissection**

- The entry tear is defined as the point where blood tracks through the intima into the media.
- The dissection is classified by the extent of media stripping from the entry tear to the distal re-entry point.

- The dissection begins with an intimal tear and is propagated by the ingress of blood into the media spiralling through the length of the aorta.
- Multiple re-entry tears are often present in the descending aorta.
- It is important to distinguish the entry tear from the extent of the dissection as surgery for Type A thoracic aortic dissection aims to excise the entry tear but often leaves residual separated layers of the aortic arch and descending aorta. As the entry tear is closed and the layers are joined at the distal ascending aorta, no further blood can enter the false lumen unless additional entry intimal tears exist within the aorta.

### 23 Where are the entry tears usually located in acute thoracic aortic dissection?

- Ascending aorta (65%) approximately 2cm above the non-coronary sinus.
- Descending aorta (20%) proximally on the left anterolateral wall.
- Aortic arch (10%) opposite the innominate artery on the lesser curve.

#### 24 What are the predisposing factors for aortic dissection?

- A: age, atherosclerosis, aneurysm.
- B: bicuspid aortic valve (fibrillin deficiency), blood pressure (hypertension).
- C: connective tissue disorders (Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome).
- D: degenerative (cystic medial degeneration).
- E: trauma, surgery, iatrogenic, pregnancy.

### 25 What are the clinical features of Type A aortic dissection?

- Pain tearing retrosternal chest pain radiating into the back or neck.
- Symptoms of organ malperfusion myocardial ischaemia, stroke or abdominal pain.
- Dyspnoea secondary to aortic regurgitation, tamponade or haemothorax.
- Hypotension, hypertension or blood pressure differential between the left and right arms.
- Aortic regurgitation murmur.
- Absent peripheral pulses.

#### 26 **What are the different investigations available for the diagnosis of acute Type A aortic dissection (Figure 15)?**

- Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE, 98% sensitive) provides clear images and is able to quantify the degree of aortic regurgitation but:
  - a) results are operator-dependent;
  - b) passing the TOE probe may cause anxiety and hypertension;
  - c) there is a blind spot in the distal ascending aorta and proximal aortic arch.
- Computed tomography with contrast enhancement (95% sensitive) is quick, commonly available and can image the pleura, head and neck vessels, and pericardium, but the patient is at risk of contrast nephropathy.

![](_page_17_Figure_8.jpeg)

**Figure 15. Acute Type A aortic dissection as demonstrated by: A) transoesophageal echocardiography; B) computed tomography; C) magnetic resonance imaging; and D) aortography. The dissection flap (arrows) separates the true and the false lumens.**

- Magnetic resonance imaging (99% sensitive) is the gold standard imaging but is not always available.
- Aortography (80% sensitive) was historically the gold standard but now is rarely used and may precipitate aortic rupture.

### 27 Describe the monitoring required for patients undergoing surgery for Type A aartic dissection

- Arterial lines pre-arch (right radial artery) and post-arch (femoral or left radial artery).
- Urinary catheter.
- Central venous access.
- Nasopharyngeal temperature probe.
- Cerebral oximetry (near infrared spectroscopy, if available) to detect cerebral malperfusion.

### 28 How is the right axillary artery cannulated for cardiopulmonary bypass (Figure 16)?

- The patient is placed in a supine position with upper body elevated to 20° and tilted towards the left, so that the skin overlying the infraclavicular fossa is on a horizontal plane.
- A 5cm infraclavicular incision is then made beneath the lateral third of the clavicle.
- The pectoralis major fibres are split with pectoralis minor retracted laterally.
- The axillary artery is mobilised from under the axillary vein avoiding the medial and lateral cords of the brachial plexus.
- A 18Fr straight arterial cannula is then placed into the axillary artery, either directly (using the Seldinger wire technique) or indirectly via an 8mm woven Dacron<sup>®</sup> graft sutured with polypropylene.
- It is important to compare right and left radial artery pressures to ensure adequate cerebral perfusion.
- This technique is not suitable if the patient has an aortic dissection that extends into the brachiocephalic artery.

![](_page_19_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Figure 16. Axillary artery cannulation.**

#### 29 **What are the principles of surgery for Type A aortic dissection (Figures 17 and 18)?**

- Entry tear resect and replace the site of the aortic entry tear.
- Aortic root to prevent coronary malperfusion and late aortic root complications, surgery can either:
  - a) repair the aortic sinus segments by adhesive reconstruction to obliterate the false lumen; or
  - b) replace the aortic root.
- Aortic valve resuspension or replacement of the aortic valve.
- Aortic arch hemi-arch or total arch replacement depending on whether the entry tear has extended into the aortic arch.
- Distal anastomotic line adhesive reconstruction at the distal anastomosis to obliterate the false lumen and restore flow through the true lumen.
- The different surgical options include:
  - a) ascending aorta interposition graft;
  - b) ascending aorta interposition graft and aortic valve replacement;
  - c) ascending aorta interposition graft and resuspension of the aortic valve;
  - d) aortic root replacement (Bentall or Cabrol);
  - e) valve-sparing aortic root replacement (Yacoub or David);
  - f) in addition, hemi-arch or total arch replacement.

![](_page_20_Picture_17.jpeg)

**Figure 17. Acute Type A aortic dissection. A) Following opening of the pericardium, a bluish discoloration of the ascending aorta is observed, indicating blood in the aortic wall. B) Following aortotomy, fresh haematoma is observed in the false lumen of the ascending aorta.**

- The underlying principle of surgery for these patients is to prevent the life-threatening complications of acute Type A aortic dissection, which include intra-pericardial rupture, tamponade, myocardial ischaemia and aortic regurgitation.
- Mortality without surgery approximates 90%, whereas surgical mortality ranges between 10-20%. Five-year survival of hospital survivors following surgery is 60%.

![](_page_21_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Figure 18. Decision-making algorithm delineating the surgical options for acute Type A aortic dissection.**

#### 30 **What is the management of a Stanford Type B thoracic aortic dissection (Figure 19)?**

• Medical management with blood pressure control - labetalol (a and b-blocker) is used to reduce the force of ventricular contraction, shear stress and absolute blood pressure.

- The rationale for not operating on all Type B aortic dissections is:
  - a) the mortality with medical management is 10% compared with an operative mortality of 27% and an operative paraplegia rate of 24%;
  - b) the 5-year survival is not improved with surgery.

![](_page_22_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Figure 19. Type B aortic dissection demonstrated on a coronal computed tomography scan.**

- 31 **What are the indications for intervention (surgical or endovascular stent grafting) on an acute Stanford Type B aortic dissection (Figures 20 and 21)?**
- Rupture or impending rupture of the descending thoracic aorta (large mediastinal haematoma, large haemothorax).
- Extension of the dissection with unremitting pain.
- Evidence of limb, visceral or spinal cord hypoperfusion metabolic acidosis, raised lactate, oliguria or anuria, paraesthesia or paraplegia in the lower limbs.

**Figure 21. Replacement of the descending aorta using a Dacron® interposition graft, following rupture of a Type B aortic dissection.**

### 32 What are the indications for endovascular stent grafting of the thoracic aorta?

- Acute and chronic Stanford Type B aortic dissection.
- Traumatic aortic injury (e.g. transection).
- Descending aortic aneurysms.
- Coarctation of the aorta.
- Aortic arch aneurysms, in conjunction with bespoke branched endografts, in situ fenestration or debranching surgery.

# 33 What are the requirements and complications of endovascular stent graft deployment in the thoracic aorta (Figure 22)?

- Requirements for optimal results following endovascular stent grafting include:
  - a) proximal and distal landing zones >1.5cm of normal aorta;
  - b) femoral arteries >7mm diameter to allow access for the stent graft;
  - c) relatively straight descending thoracic aorta.

![](_page_24_Picture_13.jpeg)

![](_page_24_Picture_14.jpeg)

Figure 22. Endovascular stent graft.

#### • Complications include:

- a) stent complication (endoleak, stent migration) 10-15%;
- b) local vascular complication 5-10%;
- c) mortality 5-10%;
- d) aortic trauma (rupture, dissection, fistula) 5%;
- e) stroke or paraplegia 5%.

#### 34 **Describe the classification of endoleaks that may occur following endovascular stent grafting**

- Endoleak is defined as blood flow between the outside of the stent graft and the diseased vessel wall. It represents a complication of endovascular stent grafting and is classified according to the source of blood:
  - a) I: leak at the junction of the aorta and the stent graft due to an inadequate seal;
  - b) II: back bleeding vessels within the aneurysmal sac;
  - c) III: leak through a defect in the stent graft prosthesis (graft failure);
  - d) IV: leak through the pores of the stent graft fabric (graft porosity).
