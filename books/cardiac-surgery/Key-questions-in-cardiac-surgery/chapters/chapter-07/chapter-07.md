### Radiological imaging

- 1 **What are the principles of chest radiography (Figure 1)?**
- A chest radiograph is a non-invasive investigation that demonstrates thoracic anatomy by using small doses (0.1mSv) of ionizing radiation (X-rays).
- Different views, including anteroposterior (AP), postero-anterior (PA) and lateral, can be obtained depending on the projection of the X-ray

**Figure 1. A) PA chest radiograph obtained with the X-ray source posteriorly and photostimulable phosphor plate anteriorly. B) Right lateral chest radiograph with the X-ray source on the right side and photostimulable phosphor plate to the left.** 

• Other views include inspiration, expiration and decubitus films.

### 2 **What are the important technical features to assess on a chest radiograph (Figure 2)?**

- Penetration the vertebral bodies should only just be visible with optimal penetration.
- Projection the position of the scapula can be used to distinguish PA from AP. The PA projection gives a more accurate assessment of cardiac size.
- Orientation the left and right side markings should be checked.
- Rotation the medial ends of the left and right clavicles should be equidistant from the spinous processes of the thoracic vertebrae.
- Inspiratory effort the anterior 6th right rib and posterior 10th right rib should be visible above the diaphragm.

### 3 **What are the important anatomical features to assess on a chest radiograph (Figure 3)?**

- Airway:
  - a) trachea. Assess the position of the trachea, which should be central or slightly deviated to the right due to the presence of the aortic knuckle.

**Figure 3. Anatomical features assessed on a PA and lateral chest radiograph. RPA = right pulmonary artery; LPA = left pulmonary artery; AA = aortic arch; RLLB = right lower lobe bronchus; RV = right ventricle; LV = left ventricle; LA = left atrium.**

#### • Breathing:

- a) lungs. Check for the presence of radio-opaque lesions, pneumothorax, haemothorax, volume loss and the position of the horizontal fissure;
- b) hila. The left hilum should be <2.5cm higher than the right with a normal concave shape.

#### • Circulation:

- a) heart. Assess the cardiac size and shape for the presence of any chamber enlargement or pericardial effusion (globular enlargement of the cardiac silhouette);
- b) mediastinum. Assess the great vessels which lie within the mediastinum.

#### • Diaphragm:

- a) position of the diaphragm. The right diaphragm is usually <3cm higher than the left;
- b) sub-phrenic space. Check for air under the diaphragm or the presence of a gastric bubble or dilated loops of bowel;
- c) costophrenic angles. Assess for pleural effusions.

#### • Extrathoracic structures:

- a) sternum, ribs, clavicles, scapulae and vertebrae. Check for any fractures or displacement.
- b) prosthetic materials valves, sternal wires, stents, catheters.

#### 4 **What are the features of a pleural effusion on a chest radiograph (Figure 4)?**

- Pleural effusions can usually be identified as a concave density in place of the normally convex diaphragm.
- On the lateral decubitus films, layering of the free fluid can be seen.

**Figure 4.** Chest radiographical features of a pleural effusion on PA and lateral films.

- 5 What are the features of pulmonary oedema on a chest radiograph (Figure 5)?
- Marked prominence of the pulmonary vasculature.
- Increased opacification of the peripheral alveolar spaces.
- Small, linear septal densities (Kerley B lines).

**Figure 5.** Chest radiographical features of pulmonary oedema.

### What are the features of a pericardial effusion on a chest radiograph (Figure 6)?

- Globular enlargement of cardiac shape.
- Since pericardial fluid is roughly the same radiographic density as blood within the myocardium, an enlarged cardiac shadow may represent either ventricular dilation or a pericardial effusion.

**Figure 6.** Chest radiographical features of a pericardial effusion.

## What are the features of traumatic aortic rupture on a chest radiograph (Figure 7)?

- Widened mediastinum.
- Partial obliteration of the descending aorta.
- Left apical cap.
- Downward displacement of the left main bronchus.
- Tracheal deviation to the right.
- Obliteration of the aortopulmonary window.
- Widened right paratracheal stripe.
- Deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right.
- Enlarged abnormal aortic contour.
- Left haemothorax.
- Displaced left paraspinal stripe.
- Displaced right paraspinal stripe.
- Fractures of the sternum, and first and second ribs.

### 8 **What are the principles of computed tomography (CT) scanning (Figure 8)?**

• Computed tomography is a non-invasive investigation where numerous X-ray beams and detectors rotate around the patient whilst the patient moves through the scanner producing a spiral path for the X-rays. This allows two-dimensional (axial, sagittal and coronal views) and three-dimensional images to be reconstructed.

![](_page_6_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Figure 8. Principles of computed tomography, where X-ray beams rotate around the patient in a spiral path.**

- Modern scanners acquire multiple slices in a single rotation allowing the whole thorax to be scanned in a few seconds.
- The degree to which the radiation is attenuated at each point is calculated and converted into a numerical value (Houndsfield units - HU) relative to the attenuation of water (which represents 0 HU).
- These numeric values are expressed graphically with the range -1000 in black and +1000 in white, with:
  - a) air -1000 HU;
  - b) lung -500 HU;
  - c) fat -100 HU;
  - d) soft tissue +20 to +80 HU;
  - e) bone +1000 HU.

![](_page_7_Figure_10.jpeg)

**Figure 9. A) Lung and B) mediastinal windows on a CT thorax. WL = window length; WW = window width; HU = Houndsfield units.**

- The window level (WL) and window width (WW) are selected around tissue of interest (Figure 9):
  - a) lung windows at a WL of -500 HU and a WW of 1500 HU;
  - b) mediastinal (soft tissue) windows at a WL of +25 HU and a WW of 350 HU.
- Contrast-enhanced scans are used when better delineation of vascular structures is required.
- 9 **What are the CT radiological features of constrictive pericarditis (Figure 10)?**

![](_page_8_Figure_7.jpeg)

**Figure 10. CT radiographical features of: A) constrictive pericarditis; and B) effusive constrictive pericarditis.**

- Thickened pericardium (>4mm) with foci of calcification in 50% of patients, which most commonly occurs along the inferior diaphragmatic surface of the pericardium.
- Dilated superior and inferior venae cavae.
- Typically associated with obliteration of the pericardial space, except in cases of effusive constrictive pericarditis.

### 10 What are the CT radiological features of traumatic aortic rupture (Figure 11)?

- Aortic intimal flap.
- Contrast extravasation.
- Aortic pseudo-aneurysm.
- Peri-aortic or mediastinal haematoma.

### 13 **What are the principles of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)(Figure 17)?**

![](_page_14_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Figure 17. Principles of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), demonstrated by: A) presence of polarized hydrogen ions in human tissue; B) alignment of the hydrogen ions by the magnetic field in a resting position (a); C) the hydrogen ions are shifted into an energized position (a1) following high-energy radiofrequency beam stimulation; D) once the beam is stopped, the hydrogen ions return to the resting position (a) and the emitted energy signal is detected by the MRI scanner.**

- Normally, hydrogen atoms, which are the major component of water, spin in a random fashion.
- The magnet in the MRI scanner aligns these hydrogen atoms to spin in the same direction.
- Radio waves produced by the MRI scanner then cause the hydrogen atoms to produce signals which are detected, enabling threedimensional images to be reconstructed.
- ECG gating allows cine images to be produced.

### 14 **What are the indications for cardiac MRI?**

• Thoracic aortic disease - for diagnosis and serial monitoring (no radiation) of aortic dissections and aneurysms (Figure 18).

![](_page_15_Picture_8.jpeg)

![](_page_15_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Figure 18. Sagittal magnetic resonance images demonstrating aneurysmal dilation of the ascending aorta and aortic arch.**

- Ischaemic heart disease to identify hibernating myocardium using resting, perfusion and dobutamine stress MRI.
- Cardiac tumours to help delineate the location and spread of these lesions and thereby guide operative planning and therapeutic options.
- Constrictive pericarditis.
- Valvular and ventricular function to quantify chamber and regurgitant volumes.

### 15 What are the contra-indications for MRI?

- Implanted pacemaker or defibrillator.
- Cochlear implant.
- Cerebral aneurysm clip.
- Occular metallic foreign body.
- Implanted medical device, such as a neural stimulator or drug infusion port.
- Metal shrapnel or bullet.
- Pregnant women.
- MRI is, however, safe with coronary stents, sternal wires, joint replacements and the majority of artificial heart valves.

### 16 What are the MRI features of viable myocardium (Figure 19)?

- Hibernating viable myocardium that is likely to recover following revascularisation can be recognised by:
  - a) resting MR end-diastolic wall thickness >6mm;
  - b) contrast (gadolinium)-enhanced MR delayed hyperenhancement with <25% transmurality. If the delayed hyperenhancement is >50% transmurality, it suggests that the left ventricle is unlikely to benefit from revascularisation. With 25-50% transmurality, further characterisation of viability is required by dobutamine stress MR;
  - c) dobutamine stress MR systolic wall thickening >2mm.

![](_page_16_Picture_16.jpeg)

**Figure 19.** Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, demonstrating 50% transmural hyper-enhancement of the anterior left ventricular (LV) wall.

• Infarcted myocardium is characterized by the absence of living cells, with increased interstitial space between the collagen fibres. This allows accumulation of gadolinium during contrast-enhanced MRI, resulting in delayed hyper-enhancement.

### 17 **What are the principles of positron emission tomography (PET)(Figure 20)?**

• Decay of a radio-isotope causes emission of a positron (positively charged electron), which interacts with surrounding electrons to emit gamma rays that are detected by the gamma camera of the PET scanner.

![](_page_17_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Figure 20. Principles of cardiac positron emission tomography.**

- PET is better at detecting changes in physiology (metabolism) than anatomy, depicted by areas of greater uptake of the radioactive tracer (hot spot). In view of this, PET is often combined with CT as PET-CT, to identify the anatomical location of the hot spot.
- 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) is a radio-isotope marker commonly used as a surrogate of cellular metabolism, as following phosphorylation by hexokinase, 18FDG becomes trapped within the cells.
- With particular respect to myocardial metabolism, during ischaemia, myocytes switch from free fatty acids to glucose as the predominant source of energy.

### 18 **What are the indications for cardiac PET (Figure 21)?**

• Myocardial perfusion - to risk stratify patients with critical coronary stenosis, using 13N ammonia,15O water or 82Rb (rubidium) as the radio-isotope.

![](_page_18_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Figure 21. Positron emission tomography, using 18FDG uptake.**

- Myocardial viability to distinguish hibernating viable myocardium from infarcted non-viable tissue, using 18FDG (metabolism) and 13N ammonia (perfusion) as the radio-isotopes:
  - a) hibernating myocardium is represented by normal metabolism and reduced perfusion (metabolism-perfusion mismatch);
  - b) a myocardial scar (infarcted tissue) is represented by a matched reduction in metabolism and perfusion.

### 19 **What are the principles of nuclear medicine scanning?**

- Decay of radio-isotopes produces g-rays. This is captured by external detectors, such as gamma cameras, to produce 2- or 3 dimensional images.
- Using these principles, cardiac nuclear medicine allows the assessment of:
  - a) myocardial perfusion and viability;
  - b) regional left ventricular contractility.

### 20 **What are the principles of nuclear myocardial perfusion scanning (Figure 22)?**

- Myocardial perfusion scanning uses the radio-isotope Thallium-201 (201Th) at rest and under stress, to assess the functional importance of coronary artery disease. It is more sensitive and specific than exercise ECG at identifying coronary artery disease.
- As a potassium analogue, which is actively transported into cells via the Na-K ATPase pump, uptake of 201Th into the cells is directly proportional to regional myocardial blood flow. The 201Th remains in the myocyte whilst the metabolic function of the cell remains intact.
- The initial injection of 201Th represents myocardial blood flow whereas re-injection of the radionucleotide marker allows assessment of redistribution, a phenomenon associated with the deranged cellular metabolism of hibernating myocardium.

![](_page_20_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 22. Myocardial perfusion scanning using Thallium-201 during stress (dobutamine 5**m**g/kg/min) and rest demonstrating: A) normal myocardium; B) inducible antero-apical ischaemia with a perfusion defect on the stress images (arrows) and restored perfusion on the rest images; and C) fullthickness antero-apical myocardial infarction with a fixed defect (arrows) on both the stress and rest images.** 

- Myocardial perfusion images are performed at rest and during stress (dobutamine, dipyridamole, adenosine or exercise) and can demonstrate a number of different conditions:
  - a) normal myocardium, which is represented by normal uptake both in rest and stress images;
  - b) reversible ischaemia, which is represented by a defect in the stress image that normalises after rest;
  - c) a chronic scar (infarcted myocardium), which is represented by a 'fixed' defect that remains unchanged in both rest and stress images;
  - d) hibernating viable myocardium, which is represented by a 'fixed' defect (in both rest and stress images) that improves on delayed imaging.

### 21 **What are the principles of multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scanning (Figure 23)?**

- MUGA scans use the principles of cardiac nuclear medicine to provide a more accurate and reproducible cine assessment of left ventricular contractility than echocardiography.
- Following intravenous injection of a radioactive material, such as technetium-99 (99Tc), which radio-labels red blood cells, gamma images are acquired, 'gated' to the patient's cardiac cycle.
- Regional wall motion abnormalities (hypokinesia, dyskinesia or akinesia) can be detected at rest and under stress (using adenosine or exercise).
- Reduced emission of gamma rays at rest usually indicate a ventricular scar following myocardial infarction, whereas defects observed during stress are indicative of areas of ischaemia.

**Figure 23. MUGA scan demonstrating: A) normal left ventricular function (EF 73%); B) impaired left ventricular function (EF 28%) with septal and lateral hypokinesia; and C) poor left ventricular function (EF 14%) with global hypokinesia / akinesia. EF = ejection fraction.**

#### 22 **What is single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) (Figure 24)?**

- SPECT combines conventional nuclear medical techniques with 3D images provided by computed tomography. A gamma camera is rotated around the patient to allow reconstructions to determine the anatomical location of differential radionucleotide, such as 99 technetium (99Tc), uptake.
- SPECT is similar to PET-CT in combining anatomical and physiological imaging but differs in that SPECT detects gamma rays directly emitted from the radionucleotide material, whereas PET detects the gamma rays produced when emitted positrons interact with surrounding electrons.
