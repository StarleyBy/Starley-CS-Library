# Pericardial disease, cardiac tumours and cardiac trauma

# What are the clinical features of pericardial tamponade?

- Haemodynamic compromise with acute dyspnoea and tachypnoea.
- Low pulse volume with pulsus paradoxus (see below).
- Low or undetectable blood pressure.
- Raised jugular venous pulse (JVP) with prominent x descent but no y descent.
- Kussmaul's sign (inspiratory rise of JVP) is not common.
- Muffled heart sounds.
- Oliguria or anuria.

### 2 What is pulsus paradoxus?

 Pulsus paradoxus is defined as an abnormally excessive fall in systolic blood pressure on inspiration >10mmHg (Figure 1).

![](_page_0_Figure_13.jpeg)

Figure 1. Pulsus paradoxus.

- Normally on inspiration there is a slight fall in systolic blood pressure (<5mmHg).
- In cardiac tamponade, the increased venous return that occurs on inspiration causes filling of the right heart, thereby displacing the interventricular septum to the left (rigid box with tamponade), resulting in less filling possible in the left heart producing a reduced cardiac output and systemic blood pressure.
- Other causes of pulsus paradoxus include constrictive pericarditis and status asthmaticus.
- 3 **What are the typical findings on investigations with pericardial tamponade (Figure 2)?**
- ECG low voltage QRS complexes, electric alternans (due to the heart moving within a fluid-filled sac).

- CXR symmetrical globular enlargement of the heart.
- Echocardiography:
  - a) large pericardial collection;
  - b) heart swinging freely within the pericardial sac;
  - c) early diastolic collapse of the right ventricle;
  - d) late diastolic collapse of the right atrium;
  - e) marked respiratory tricuspid valve (>40%) and mitral valve (>25%) inflow variation.

# 4 What is the treatment for pericardial tamponade?

- Depending on the stability of the patient and the underlying cause:
  - a) paraxiphoid pericardiocentesis;
  - b) subxiphoid drainage of the pericardial collection;
  - c) anterolateral thoracotomy drainage of the pericardial collection with a pericardial window;
  - d) re-opening of median sternotomy.

# 5 What are the causes of constrictive pericarditis?

- Idiopathic, which is the major cause in the developed world.
- Infection tuberculosis, viral (Coxsackie), fungal (Histoplasma).
- Mediastinal radiotherapy, which is dose-dependent (e.g. for lymphoma).
- Post-cardiac surgery (incidence 0.2-0.3%).
- Rare causes include tumour (mesothelioma), drugs (procainamide, hydralazine), sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, carcinoid syndrome, uraemia, trauma and myocardial infarction.

# 6 What are the clinical features of constrictive pericarditis?

- Symptoms of left and right heart failure, including dyspnoea, fatigue, weakness, anorexia, peripheral oedema and ascites.
- Raised jugular venous pressure.
- Ascites.
- Peripheral oedema.
- Hepatosplenomegaly.
- Displaced apex beat.
- Muffled heart sounds.
- Narrowed pulse pressure.
- Kussmaul's sign.
- Pulsus paradoxus may be present.

# 7 **What are the diagnostic findings of constrictive pericarditis (Figure 3)?**

- CXR pericardial calcification and bilateral pleural effusions.
- Echocardiogram impaired diastolic ventricular filling, thickened echobright pericardium, and dilated right atrium, inferior vena cava and hepatic veins.
- Doppler echocardiography increased E:A ratio (rapid early filling and diastasis) and decreased inspiratory flow reduction in the hepatic veins.
- Coronary angiography radiation-induced coronary artery disease.
- CT/MRI thickened pericardium >4mm (compared to normal thickness 1-2mm).

- Cardiac catheterisation allows differentiation of constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy:
  - a) equalisation (within 5mmHg) of raised left and right ventricular end-diastolic pressures at any phase of respiration;
  - b) equalisation of raised (>10mmHg) left and right atrial pressures with prominent x and y descents;
  - c) square root sign dip and plateau pattern of ventricular pressure with most of the diastolic filling occurring in early diastole, due to raised venous pressure, which then halts abruptly in mid-diastole;
  - d) left ventricular systolic function is usually normal but may be impaired in severe cases;
  - e) pulmonary artery systolic pressure <50mmHg;
  - f) right ventricular end-diastolic to systolic pressure ratio >1:3;
  - g) these findings can be masked by hypovolaemia but can be revealed with rapid fluid transfusion.

### 8 **How is constrictive pericarditis (CP) differentiated from restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)?**

- Certain features occur in both RCM and CP:
  - a) increased EA ratio on the mitral valve inflow pattern;
  - b) dip and plateau ventricular waveform;
  - c) prominent x and y descents on the atrial waveform.
- Patients with RCM are more likely to have:
  - a) pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery systolic pressure >50mmHg);
  - b) reduced left ventricular function (EF <40%);
  - c) endomyocardial biopsy evidence of an infiltrative process.
- Patients with CP are more likely to have:
  - a) equalization of left and right ventricular end-diastolic pressure (<5mmHg);
  - b) Kussmaul's sign;
  - c) right ventricular end-diastolic to systolic pressure ratio >1:3;
  - d) CT or echocardiographic evidence of a thickened pericardium.

# What are the principles of pericardiectomy (Figure 4)?

- The aim is to achieve complete removal of all thickened pericardium and epicardium from the left and right ventricle and diaphragm, whilst preserving both phrenic nerves.
- Cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest are usually required for clearance of the posterior pericardium.
- Although incomplete resection of the pericardium overlying the atria
  risks residual constrictive haemodynamics, removal of densely
  adherent atrial tissue is not always necessary as the
  pathophysiology mainly affects ventricular filling.
- Operative mortality is 10-15% with a 5-year survival of 70% following pericardiectomy.

# 10 What are the causes of restrictive cardiomyopathy (SAILS)?

- Scleroderma.
- Amyloidosis.
- Iron storage diseases.
- Loeffler's eosinophilic endocarditis / endomyocardial fibrosis.
- Sarcoidosis.

### How are cardiac neoplasms classified?

- Primary tumours, of which 75% are benign and 25% malignant.
- Secondary tumours from metastatic spread (lymphoma, breast, lung, melanoma, sarcoma) and direct spread (oesophagus, lung, breast, thymus) to the heart are 30 times more common than primary cardiac tumours.
- Subdiaphragmatic tumours originating from the kidneys, uterus, liver and adrenals, may also 'invade' the atrium via the inferior vena cava (Figure 5).

# 12 **What are the most frequent primary benign cardiac tumours?**

- Myxoma (see below).
- Lipoma, which present as well encapsulated tumours throughout the heart (especially the right atrium), commonly in obese, elderly, female patients. Surgery is usually indicated for symptomatic patients caused by obstruction to cardiac flow.
- Fibroelastoma (Figure 6), which usually occur on cardiac valves (especially mitral and aortic) or in ventricles as masses with frondlike projections. They can be asymptomatic, obstruct flow or embolise, and therefore are treated by resection.
- Rhabdomyoma, which are the commonest benign primary cardiac tumour in children, and present as multicentric, pedunculated tumours in either ventricle, with obstructive symptoms, valvular regurgitation or arrhythmias.
- Other primary benign cardiac tumours include fibroma, haemangioma, teratoma, neurofibroma and lymphangioma.

**Figure 6. Fibroelastoma.**

### 13 **What are the most frequent primary malignant cardiac tumours?**

- Angiosarcoma, which are frequently located in the atria and present with caval or valvular obstruction. Patients usually have distant metastases at the time of presentation and this is associated with a poor prognosis (median survival is approximately 6 months).
- Rhabdomyosarcoma, which are multicentric tumours that occur in all locations throughout the heart. They are usually treated by resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Median survival is approximately 12 months.
- Other primary malignant cardiac tumours include fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma and liposarcoma.
- Most sarcomas are incurable but cardiac transplantation can be considered for those without metastatic spread.

# 14 **What is the epidemiology of cardiac myxomas?**

- Cardiac myxomas occur with an incidence of 1:500,000 with 5% familial.
- They are commonest in patients aged with a female predominance (70%).
- They account for 40% of benign cardiac tumours in adults and 15% in children.
- The majority of cardiac myxomas are located in the left atrium (75%) usually originating from the interatrial septum, with 20% in the right atrium and 5% in the ventricles or attached to valves.

# 15 **What is Carney's syndrome?**

- Carney's syndrome is an autosomal dominant familial form of atrial myxoma.
- It occurs with a male predominance at an earlier age than the nonfamilial form, often in childhood.
- They commonly occur in both atria and are multicentric (65%) with frequent recurrence (40%).
- They are associated with adrenocortical nodular masses, Sertoli cell testicular tumours and spotty mucocutaneous pigmentation.

# 16 What is the pathology of cardiac myxomas (Figure 7)?

- Cardiac myxomas are neoplasms of endocardial origin, derived from either pluripotent mesenchymal cells or endocardial nerve cells.
- They often appear as ovoid, pedunculated masses, which are friable, mucoid, gray-white in colour and smooth or granular in appearance.
- Histological analysis of cardiac tumours reveals an acid mucopolysaccharide matrix with polygonal cells, capillary-like structures and haemorrhagic areas.

# 17 What are the clinical features of cardiac myxomas (Figure 8)?

- Patients with cardiac myxomas present with symptoms related to:
  - a) obstruction to blood flow;
  - b) interference with valvular function;
  - c) systemic embolisation;
  - d) constitutional symptoms fever, weight loss, malaise, myalgia, anaemia.
- Diastolic murmur (mimics mitral or tricuspid stenosis).
- Early diastolic tumour 'plop'.
- Pan-systolic murmur of mitral or tricuspid regurgitation (wrecking ball effect).

![](_page_11_Picture_2.jpeg)

**434 Figure 8. Echocardiographic image demonstrating a left atrial myxoma attached to the interatrial septum.**

# 18 **What are the principles of surgery for patients with left atrial myxomas?**

- Following a median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass is instituted using bicaval cannulation and snares, with minimal cardiac manipulation to avoid tumour embolisation.
- The myxoma is approached via a standard left atriotomy, a transseptal atrial incision or a Dubost bi-atrial incision.
- Ideally the tumour is resected en bloc with clear resection margins and if the interatrial septum is involved, it may be closed with a pericardial patch.
- Irrigate the atrial cavity with saline to wash away any residual neoplastic cells (avoid using cell-saver or bypass suction).
- Assess valvular function for any 'wrecking ball' effect causing regurgitation.
- A recurrence rate of <5% occurs due to:
  - a) inadequate resection;
  - b) tumour seeding at the primary operation; or
  - c) multicentric tumours.

### 19 **What is the pathophysiology of traumatic aortic rupture (aortic transection)?**

- Traumatic aortic rupture usually occurs following a deceleration injury, which causes strain at the points of anatomical fixation of the thoracic aorta.
- As the descending aorta is held in place by the intercostal arteries and the ligamentum arteriosum, aortic transection usually occurs at the aortic isthmus (between the left subclavian artery and the ligamentum arteriosum) in 80-90% of cases with the remaining at the origin of the aortic arch branches.
- The majority (80-90%) of patients with traumatic aortic rupture die at the scene of injury, with 50% of survivors dying within the next 48 hours.
- The adventitia and surrounding fascia of the thoracic aorta can maintain luminal continuity following traumatic aortic rupture.
- In certain situations, it is necessary to diagnose and treat other lifethreatening injuries first and if this is the case the systolic blood pressure needs to be kept <110mmHg.

# 20 **What are the clinical features of traumatic aortic rupture?**

- The diagnosis of traumatic aortic rupture should be considered in all patients that have sustained severe blunt thoracic trauma, especially in those with upper rib (1st-3rd), sternal and scapula fractures.
- Retrosternal or interscapular pain caused by stretching or dissection of the aortic adventitia.
- Haemodynamic compromise producing tachycardia, hypotension and oliguria.
- Peri-aortic haematoma causing compression of surrounding structures resulting in dysphagia, stridor, dyspnoea or hoarseness.

### 21 **What are the typical radiological findings with traumatic aortic injury (Figure 9)?**

- Chest radiograph:
  - a) widened (>8cm) superior mediastinum (note most trauma chest radiographs are anterior-posterior in projection, which artificially enlarges the mediastinal silhouette);
  - b) fractures of the superior thoracic cage (1st-3rd ribs, sternum, scapula);
  - c) obliteration of the aortic knob;

- d) left apical pleural cap;
- e) left pleural effusion or haemothorax;
- f) deviation of the oesophagus (nasogastric tube) to the right;
- g) deviation of the trachea (endotracheal tube) to the right;
- h) displacement of the left hilum downwards;
- i) widening of the paratracheal and paraspinal stripe.

### • CT scan:

- a) disruption of the aortic lumen;
- b) extravasation of radio-opaque contrast;
- c) peri-aortic haematoma.

# 22 **What are the surgical options for treating traumatic aortic rupture?**

- The patient is positioned for a left thoracotomy with the pelvis slightly rotated to gain access to the left femoral vessels, if required.
- The aortic isthmus is then carefully dissected and following clamping of the aortic arch (between the left subclavian artery and left common carotid artery), the left subclavian artery and the distal descending thoracic aorta, an interposition graft is anastomosed to the thoracic aorta, using a number of different adjunct techniques:
  - a) clamp and sew technique, which avoids the need for cardiopulmonary bypass and systemic heparinisation, but is associated with an increased risk of paraplegia if the clamp time exceeds 30 minutes;
  - b) Gott shunt, using heparin-bonded tubing to bypass the area of aorta undergoing surgery, from the ascending aorta or left ventricular apex to the descending aorta or femoral artery (Figure 10);
  - c) left heart bypass, using heparin-bonded tubing between the left atrial appendage and the left femoral artery with a centrifugal pump (no oxygenator or heat exchanger) at ~2L/min and no need for systemic heparinisation;
  - d) total cardiopulmonary bypass from the femoral vein to the femoral artery, which allows better control of collateral flow with improved surgical visualisation but requires administration of systemic heparin.
- Endovascular stenting should also be considered for patients with traumatic aortic rupture.

# 23 **What are the indications for an emergency resuscitative thoracotomy?**

- According to the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS®) guidelines, following penetrating trauma (not blunt trauma) within 10 minutes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA).
- It is performed by a left anterolateral thoracotomy through the 4th intercostal space.
- Through this access, the therapeutic options include:
  - a) evacuation of the pericardium;
  - b) open cardiac massage;
  - c) clamping of the descending aorta (to stop distal bleeding and increase coronary and cerebral perfusion).

# 24 **What are the principles of treating blunt cardiac trauma?**

- Patients with blunt cardiac trauma are managed as per the ATLS® guidelines with particular attention to cardiac dysrhythmias, tamponade and myocardial contusion.
- These patients should be monitored in a high dependency area with serial ECGs, echocardiograms, cardiac enzymes, chest radiographs and CT scans.
- Blunt cardiac trauma may result in left pleuropericardial tears, right atrial disruption at the caval junctions, atrial or ventricular septal defects or aortic regurgitation.

# 25 **What are the principles of treating penetrating cardiac trauma (Figure 11)?**

- Prompt diagnosis of cardiac tamponade is essential by clinical signs (haemodynamic compromise, Beck's triad, Kussmaul's sign, pulsus paradoxus) and echocardiography.
- Patients need prompt decompression by paraxiphoid pericardiocentesis and then operative closure of the penetrating cardiac wound.
- Access to the heart is obtained by a left anterolateral thoracotomy in emergency situations, otherwise a median sternotomy gives better access to the pericardium and great vessels if time permits.
- Once the mediastinum is accessed, the pericardium is opened, any clots or liquid evacuated, open cardiac massage performed and any bleeding point occluded.
- Atrial and ventricular lacerations are treated with direct suture and may be buttressed by Teflon® strips.

B) Operative image following a median sternotomy illustrating the path of the bullet with a repaired main pulmonary artery, a tear in the right atrium occluded by a Foley catheter and a hole in the right pleura.**

- Coronary artery lacerations may need ligation and bypass grafting.
- If a posterior cardiac injury is observed, it is important to avoid air embolism when lifting the heart.
