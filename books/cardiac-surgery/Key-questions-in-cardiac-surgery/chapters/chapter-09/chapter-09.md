#### Cardiopulmonary bypass scenarios

### What are the important considerations when commencing cardiopulmonary bypass?

- Cardiopulmonary bypass begins by progressively increasing the venous return to the bypass machine, whilst gradually increasing the arterial flow. At this stage, it is important to monitor several different haemodynamic parameters:
  - a) decompression of the heart;
  - b) venous drainage;
  - c) arterial line pressures;
  - d) systemic arterial and venous pressures;
  - e) arterial blood oxygen concentration;
  - f) venous reservoir levels.
- Once bypass has been established for 2 minutes and the above haemodynamic factors are stable, lung ventilation can be discontinued, systemic cooling commenced and the aortic crossclamp applied, as appropriate.

### What are the causes of failure of the heart to arrest with antegrade cardioplegia?

- Aortic regurgitation (check for left ventricular distension).
- Aortic cross-clamp not applied completely across the aorta.
- High-grade proximal coronary artery stenosis.
- Low potassium concentration in the cardioplegia solution.
- Poor flow through the cardioplegia line caused by kinking, clamping or the cannula trapped in the aortic cross-clamp.

### 3 What are the common causes of poor venous return or an empty venous reservoir?

- Systemic vasodilation.
- Volume loss from:
  - a) bleeding;
  - b) pooling of blood in either pleural cavity;
  - c) iatrogenic aortic dissection.
- Inadequate venous drainage, caused by:
  - a) a kinked or clamped venous line;
  - b) venous airlock:
  - c) venous cannula malposition;
  - d) obstruction to flow by caval snares;
  - e) an inferior vena caval tear caused during venous cannulation;
  - f) an inadequate height differential between the right atrium and the venous reservoir.

## 4 What are the main principles for managing a large inferior vena cava (IVC) tear caused during venous cannulation?

- Carefully advance the venous cannula into the IVC beyond the tear to obtain venous drainage along with cardiotomy suction return.
- Use a supplemental purse string to secure the venous cannula.
- Cool the patient to 18°C.
- During circulatory arrest, the IVC can be repaired by direct suture or using a bovine pericardial patch.

### What are the main principles of managing a massive airlock in the venous line?

- Stop the cardiopulmonary bypass pump.
- Separate the venous cannula from the venous line.
- Manually fill the venous line with saline.
- Reconnect the venous cannula to the venous line.
- If there is a small to moderate amount of air, it can be 'chased' back into the reservoir by progressively lifting the venous line.

### What are the causes of raised central venous pressure whilst on cardiopulmonary bypass?

- Poor venous drainage.
- Central venous catheter snared or abutting the superior vena cava (SVC) cannula.
- Lifted and rotated heart (e.g. when accessing the circumflex vessels during coronary artery bypass grafting).

# What are the main principles in managing massive arterial air embolism during cardiopulmonary bypass?

- Stop the cardiopulmonary bypass pump and clamp both the arterial and venous lines.
- Place the patient in a steep Trendelenburg position.
- Remove the arterial cannula and aspirate any air at the site of entry.
- Remove the venous cannula.
- Place the arterial cannula via the right atrium into the superior vena cava with a snare.
- Commence temporary retrograde cerebral perfusion at 400-500mL/min for approximately 3 minutes to de-air, until bubbles stop coming out of the aorta.
- Concomitantly, mannitol and dexamethasone are given intravenously with ice packs placed around the head to aid cerebral protection.
- Antegrade circulation is then recommenced with deep hypothermia (18-20°C) for 30 minutes to increase the solubility of air.
- The perfusion pressures are kept relatively high at 70-80mmHg and 100% inspired oxygen concentration (FiO<sub>2</sub>).
- Using transoesophageal echocardiography guidance, any residual air in the cardiac chambers and great vessels is removed.
- To de-air the vertebral arteries, intermittent occlusion of the carotid arteries is performed.
- Any sources of air ingress are also identified and corrected, including stopcocks, loose arterial connections, left ventricular vent catheters, oxygenator membrane leaks, an empty venous reservoir, loose pursestring sutures and cardioplegia infusion catheters.

### 8 What are the causes of hypoxia whilst on cardiopulmonary bypass?

- Low cardiopulmonary bypass pump flow rate.
- Low inspired oxygen concentration (FiO<sub>2</sub>) delivered to the circuit.
- Failure of the cardiopulmonary bypass pump oxygenator.

### What are the main principles of managing an arterial cannula that falls out during cardiopulmonary bypass?

- Stop the cardiopulmonary bypass pump.
- Clamp the venous line.
- Flush the arterial line with forward flow from the pump.
- Replace the arterial cannula.
- Reconnect the arterial line and the arterial cannula, ensuring the absence of air bubbles.

#### 10 What are the causes of a high arterial line pressure?

- Arterial cannula abutting the arterial wall or a plaque on the arterial wall.
- latrogenic aortic dissection.
- Selective cannulation of an aortic arch vessel.
- Normal arterial line pressures are approximately 300mmHg.

### What are the causes of hypotension whilst on cardiopulmonary bypass?

- Low cardiopulmonary bypass flow rate.
- Damped arterial line trace.
- Low systemic vascular resistance, secondary to:
  - a) sepsis;
  - b) pre-operative vasodilators;
  - c) cytokines returned to the circulation via the cardiotomy suckers from pooled blood in the pleural cavity.
- Kinked or clamped arterial cannula.
- latrogenic aortic dissection.
- Selective cannulation of the aortic arch vessels.

### 12 What are the causes of hypertension on cardiopulmonary bypass?

- High cardiopulmonary bypass pump flow rate.
- Selective cannulation of the brachiocephalic artery (with a right radial arterial line).
- Increased systemic vascular resistance (vasoconstriction), secondary to:
  - a) vasopressors;
  - b) hypothermia;
  - c) inadequate anaesthesia.

### 13 What are the signs of iatrogenic aortic dissection caused during aortic cannulation?

- Spreading haematoma with bleeding at a point distal to the cannulation site.
- Classically a boggy mass may be palpable in the oblique sinus which may push the heart anteriorly.
- Failure of blood to rise to the top of the arterial cannula.
- Poor swing on the arterial line following removal of the line clamp.
- High line pressures when fluid is infused via the arterial cannula.
- Profound hypotension with poor venous return.

## 14 What are the main principles of managing iatrogenic aortic dissection caused during aortic cannulation?

- Stop the cardiopulmonary bypass pump immediately and clamp the arterial and venous lines.
- Insert the aortic cannula into the right atrium, to rapidly infuse volume as required.
- Insert an arterial cannula into a peripheral artery or uninvolved distal aorta.
- Following deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (18°C), the ascending aorta is opened and inspected for dissection at the original site of cannulation.
- The aorta can then be repaired using a direct suture, patch or interposition graft depending on the extent of the dissection.
- It is important to recognise and treat iatrogenic aortic dissection immediately, to limit the extent of the injury and restore systemic perfusion.

• When recognised early, survival rates following iatrogenic aortic dissection are 66% to 85%, but when discovered after operation survival is approximately 50%.

#### 15 **What are the causes of oliguria on cardiopulmonary bypass?**

- Pre-renal (reduced renal perfusion) secondary to:
  - a) an inadequate cardiopulmonary bypass flow rate;
  - b) hypovolaemia;
  - c) renal vasoconstriction (mediated by a-agonists);
  - d) undetected iatrogenic aortic dissection.
- Renal: pre-operative renal dysfunction.
- Post-renal: secondary to an obstructed urinary catheter (kinked, blood clot, lidocaine gel).

#### 16 **What are the causes of haematuria on cardiopulmonary bypass?**

- Urinary tract trauma during catheterisation followed by systemic heparinisation for cardiopulmonary bypass.
- Haemolysis, secondary to:
  - a) cardiotomy suction;
  - b) prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass;
  - c) acquired red cell fragility (hepatic dysfunction, endocarditis);
  - d) congenital red cell anomalies (sickle cell disease, spherocytosis).

#### 17 **Describe the de-airing routine following an aortic valve replacement**

- Throughout the procedure, carbon dioxide is insufflated into the surgical field. Just prior to tying down the aortotomy suture:
  - a) the patient is placed in the Trendelenburg position;
  - b) the venous line is partially occluded to fill the heart;
  - c) the heart is gently agitated whilst keeping the aortotomy open with forceps to allow release of trapped air;
  - d) the lungs are inflated to displace any air in the pulmonary veins;

- e) the aortic cross-clamp is removed and the aortotomy suture line is tied;
- f) the aortic root vent is turned on at 300mL/min. As the heart begins to eject, any air trapped within the left ventricle is ejected into the aorta and removed by the root vent.
- Transoesophageal echocardiography is used to aid the de-airing process.

#### 18 **What are the important factors to consider before weaning a patient from cardiopulmonary bypass?**

- Patient factors:
  - a) temperature ensure that the peripheral temperature has reached 34°C and that the central core temperature is above 36.5°C. Rewarming of the circulating blood usually commences during the last distal anastomosis (CABG) or during closure of the aortotomy (AVR) or atriotomy (MVR), with the aid of a warming blanket;
  - b) electrocardiogram ensure that the:
    - i) rate is above 60 bpm or consider using epicardial pacing wires;
    - ii) rhythm is sinus or longstanding atrial fibrillation, otherwise consider electrical cardioversion or commencing an anti-arrhythmic agent;
    - iii) ST segment is isoelectric, otherwise consider resting the heart until any ischaemic changes have resolved;
  - c) blood pressure ensure that the mean arterial pressure (>60mmHg) is enough to sustain organ perfusion, otherwise consider commencing a vasopressor (such as noradrenaline).

#### • Surgical factors:

- a) operation is complete;
- b) all the surgical sites have been checked for bleeding;
- c) left and right ventricular function is as expected, otherwise consider commencing inotropic support or inserting an intraaortic balloon pump;
- d) snares released in patients with bicaval cannulation;
- e) decompress the pericardial and pleural cavities:
  - i) suction any residual blood or topical cooling fluid;
  - ii) remove any swabs;
  - iii) decompress any pneumothorax.

#### • Anaesthetic factors:

- a) arterial blood gases ensure that the PaO2 is >15kPa, PaCO2 is <6kPa, base excess is <-4mmol/L and the serum potassium is <5.5mmol/L;
- b) transoesophageal echocardiography ensure that all intracardiac air has been removed following all open-heart cardiac surgical procedures;
- c) ventilation ensure that both lungs are fully expanded prior to weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass.

#### 19 **What are the steps involved in weaning a patient from cardiopulmonary bypass?**

- The perfusionist gradually occludes the venous line and simultaneously reduces the pump flow, allowing the heart to gradually fill and eject independent of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.
- Initially the volume in the venous reservoir is kept constant, but as pump flow approaches zero, volume is added or removed from the patient to produce appropriate arterial and venous pressures.
- Ideally, the patient is weaned slightly underfilled, to reduce the myocardial oxygen demands when the heart is just recovering.
- The preload can be adjusted by transfusing boluses of 50-100mL to achieve the appropriate filling pressures.
- Adequacy of filling and myocardial function is determined by a number of haemodynamic parameters that are monitored as the patient is weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass:
  - a) central venous pressure;
  - b) mean arterial pressure;
  - c) pulmonary arterial pressure;
  - d) cardiac index;
  - e) cardiac rate and rhythm;
  - f) left and right heart contractility, observed directly and echocardiographically.
- Once haemodynamic stability has been achieved and all intracardiac repairs assessed to be successful on transoesophageal echocardiography, the venous cannulae can be removed.
- Once all surgical sites have been checked for bleeding and haemostasis achieved, protamine is given. The aortic cannula is left in at this stage to allow for rapid transfusion if the patient were to develop a protamine reaction.

- Any residual blood within the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit is then washed via the cell saver and retransfused.
- The heart-lung machine can be disassembled once the sternum is closed and the patient is haemodynamically stable.

#### 20 **What are the common causes of hypotension after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass?**

- Reduced preload, secondary to:
  - a) hypovolaemia;
  - b) bleeding;
  - c) swabs compressing the heart;
  - d) 'hitched up' pericardium, restricting venous return.
- Reduced ventricular contractility, secondary to:
  - a) myocardial stunning;
  - b) incomplete revascularisation;
  - c) inadequate myocardial protection;
  - d) coronary air embolism;
  - e) coronary artery bypass graft failure, secondary to anastomotic narrowing or inadequate graft length.
- Vasodilation, secondary to cardiopulmonary bypass-induced systemic inflammatory response.
- Arrhythmias, including inadequate pacing.
- Management includes treating the underlying cause, transfusing volume, achieving haemostasis, inotropic and vasopressor support, resting the heart back on cardiopulmonary bypass and inserting an intra-aortic balloon pump.
