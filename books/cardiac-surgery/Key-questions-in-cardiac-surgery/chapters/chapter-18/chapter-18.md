### Heart failure

#### What is heart failure?

 Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome resulting from any structural or functional cardiac disorder, that impairs the ability of the ventricle to fill with or eject blood, and results in a cardiac output which is inadequate to meet the metabolic demands of the body.

### 2 What are the symptoms of left heart failure?

- Dyspnoea, orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea.
- Fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance.
- Weight loss and muscle wasting, which may progress to cachexia.
- Cold peripheries.
- Systemic embolism.

### 3 What are the symptoms of right heart failure?

- Peripheral oedema.
- Ascites.
- Hepatic congestion and pain.
- Distended varicose veins.
- Epistaxis.

### 4 What are the signs of heart failure?

- Peripheral cyanosis with cold peripheries.
- Low pulse volume, resting tachycardia or pulsus alternans (in severe cases).
- Hypotension with low pulse pressure.
- Raised systemic venous pressure, resulting in a prominent jugular venous pulse, and prominent veins over the chest, abdomen and legs.
- Displaced apex beat.
- Right ventricular heave.
- 3rd heart sound (gallop rhythm).

- Pleural effusions.
- Smooth hepatomegaly.
- Ascites.
- Peripheral oedema.

## 5 What is the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification?

- It is a functional classification that relates the patient's symptoms (dyspnoea or fatigue) and the ability to perform activities:
  - a) I: no limitations of physical activity and no symptoms with ordinary activity;
  - b) II: slight limitation of physical activity but comfortable at rest or mild exertion;
  - III: marked limitation of physical activity and comfortable only at rest;
  - d) IV: symptoms of heart failure at rest.

#### 6 How is heart failure classified?

- According to the American Heart Association (AHA) classification of heart failure:
  - a) stage A: asymptomatic patient at risk of developing heart failure (e.g. hypertension or coronary artery disease);
  - stage B: asymptomatic patient with ventricular changes of heart failure (e.g. left ventricular hypertrophy or systolic dysfunction);
  - c) stage C: patients with a current or past history of symptomatic heart failure associated with structural changes;
  - d) stage D: patients with refractory heart failure.

### 7 What is the pathophysiology of chronic heart failure?

- The inadequate cardiac output associated with heart failure triggers neuro-endocrine activation, including:
  - a) activation of the sympathetic nervous system;
  - b) activation of the renin-angiotensin system;
  - c) the release of endogenous noradrenaline, antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin) and endothelin.

This results in fluid retention and an inappropriately high afterload.

- In response to fluid overload associated with heart failure, atrial and brain natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP) are released. Their actions include:
  - a) natriuresis and diuresis;
  - b) arterial and venous dilation;
  - c) inhibition of ADH and aldosterone release.

Their effects, however, are overwhelmed by the neuro-endocrine activation.

### 8 **What are the main causes of heart failure?**

- Increased pre-load (volume overload), secondary to mitral or aortic regurgitation, atrial or ventricular septal defects.
- Reduced contractility, secondary to coronary artery disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy or myocarditis.
- Increased afterload (pressure overload), secondary to aortic stenosis, hypertension or aortic coarctation.
- Impaired cardiac rhythm, secondary to atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
- Impaired ventricular filling, secondary to pericardial tamponade, constrictive pericarditis or mitral stenosis.
- High-output heart failure, secondary to anaemia, sepsis, arteriovenous fistula, hyperthyroidism or pregnancy.

### 9 **What are the principles of treatment in heart failure and the studies that investigated their therapeutic efficacy?**

- Treat the underlying cause:
  - a) coronary artery bypass grafting (CASS);
  - b) mitral valve surgery;
  - c) aortic valve replacement.
- Reduce pre-load:
  - a) diuretics;
  - b) aldosterone antagonism (RALES).
- Left ventricular volume reduction (SAVER, RESTORE and STICH).
- Improve contractility mechanical or biological:
  - a) cardiac resynchronization therapy (MUSTIC);
  - b) implantable cardioverter defibrillator (MADIT);

- c) ventricular assist devices (REMATCH);
- d) dynamic cardiomyoplasty (C-SMART);
- e) cardiac transplantation (COCPIT);
- f) cellular cardiomyoplasty (MAGIC).

### • Reduce afterload:

- a) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (SOLVD, CONSENSUS);
- b) angiotensin receptor blockers (CHARM, Val-HeFT);
- c) b-blockers (COPERNICUS);
- d) intra-aortic balloon pump;
- e) ventricular septal myectomy (Morrow operation) for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

(Please refer to the abbreviation list on pages x-xvi for the full trial names.)

## 10 **What is viable myocardium?**

- Viable myocardium is defined as cardiac muscle amenable to revascularisation. This includes:
  - a) hibernating myocardium;
  - b) stunned myocardium;
  - c) ischaemic myocardium.

### 11 **What is hibernating myocardium?**

• Hibernating myocardium is defined as the state of myocardial hypocontractility during chronic hypoperfusion, which recovers functionally upon revascularisation.

### 12 **What is myocardial stunning?**

• Myocardial stunning is defined as cardiac dysfunction following a period of ischaemia-reperfusion. It may last up to 2 weeks.

### 13 **How is hibernating myocardium identified?**

• Dobutamine stress echocardiography - a biphasic response (demonstrating increased contractility with low-dose dobutamine but not with high-dose dobutamine) is indicative of hibernating myocardium.

- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signs indicative of hibernating myocardium include:
  - a) absence of myocardial thinning (<6mm) on perfusion MRI;
  - b) delayed hyperenhancement on gadolinium-enhanced MRI;
  - c) a biphasic response on dobutamine stress MRI.
- Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning normal uptake with 18FDG (marker of metabolism) but decreased uptake of 13N ammonia or 15O water (markers of perfusion).
- 201Thallium nuclear medicine scan increased uptake on late redistribution.

### 14 **What are the indications for coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with heart failure?**

- Indications include:
  - a) coronary artery disease with reasonable target vessels to graft;
  - b) myocardial ischaemia (evidenced by chest pain);
  - c) myocardial viability (evidenced by hibernating myocardium see above); >20% of left ventricle demonstrating viability.
- The evidence for treating these patients was provided by the CASS Registry, with the 5-year survival for patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy (coronary artery disease and ejection fraction <25%) being 41% for patients treated medically and 62% for those undergoing surgery.
- Further evidence may be provided by the STICH trial hypothesis I.
- The survival advantage from coronary artery bypass surgery in these patients increases as the ejection fraction decreases.
- The relative contra-indications to coronary artery bypass surgery in these patients include:
  - a) poor target vessels;
  - b) pulmonary hypertension (>60mm Hg);
  - c) significantly impaired right ventricular function.

### 15 **What are the main principles of biventricular pacing (cardiac resynchronization therapy, Figure 1)?**

• Ventricular dyssynchrony often results from left bundle branch block (LBBB) as earlier contraction of the right ventricle and paradoxical

![](_page_5_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 1. Biventricular pacing. A) Left bundle branch block (LBBB) causes delayed left ventricular contraction with paradoxical septal motion in systole. B) Biventricular pacing induces synchronous contraction of the left and right ventricles and improved contribution of the septum to left ventricular contraction.**

- ventricular septal motion leads to impaired left ventricular filling and impaired left ventricular systolic function.
- Biventricular pacing induces simultaneous left and right ventricular contraction, thereby increasing the efficacy of ventricular contractility without increasing myocardial oxygen consumption.
- Biventricular pacing is indicated in patients with:
  - a) heart failure for at least 6 weeks on maximal medical therapy;
  - b) NYHA functional status III or IV;
  - c) left ventricular ejection fraction <35%;
  - d) QRS interval >150ms.

### 16 **What are the indications for an implantable cardiodefibrillator in heart failure?**

- Primary prevention, in patients who have sustained a previous myocardial infarction with an ejection fraction of <35%, with:
  - a) non-sustained ventricular tachycardia; or
  - b) inducible ventricular tachycardia on electro-physiological studies.
- Secondary prevention, in patients with haemodynamically significant ventricular tachyarrhythmias and an ejection fraction of <35%.
- It is important to treat any underlying causes including drug toxicity, electrolyte disturbance, and reversible ischaemia, before implanting a cardio-defibrillator device.

### 17 **What is partial left ventriculectomy (Batista procedure, Figure 2)?**

- The Batista procedure involves resection of the posterolateral left ventricular wall between the anterior and posterior papillary muscles from the apex to the mitral valve annulus. The papillary muscles may also be resected or re-implanted to ensure an adequate portion of the left ventricle is removed. Subsequent mitral valve annuloplasty or replacement may be required to ensure competency of the valve.
- The principal aim of the procedure is to reduce left ventricular volume and wall stress (Laplace's law), thereby improving overall ventricular contractility.
- Although initial results from Batista suggested improved survival and symptoms, subsequent studies in ischaemic cardiomyopathic patients failed to show a sustained benefit of this procedure. This may have been caused by resection of viable sections of the lateral left ventricular wall.

C) Remodelled left ventricle with a two-layered ventriculotomy closure. OM1 = 1st obtuse marginal artery; LAD = left anterior descending artery; Ao = aorta; PA = pulmonary artery; LA = left atrium; LV= left ventricle.**

### 18 **What is dynamic cardiomyoplasty (Figure 3)?**

- Dynamic cardiomyoplasty involves mobilisation of the latissimus dorsi muscle on its neurovascular pedicle. Following transposition into the chest through a small left thoracotomy, the muscle is wrapped around the left and right ventricles.
- Concomitant implantation of a pacemaker coupled to a neurotransmitter electrically stimulates the muscle to contract in synchrony with ventricular systole.
- Over time, pacing of the skeletal muscle induces transformation from fast twitch to slow twitch muscle, which is less fatigable.
- The mechanisms of action of dynamic cardiomyoplasty include:
  - a) augmenting muscular pump function resulting in increased stroke volume;
  - b) girdling of the ventricles as an external constraint device, resulting in reduced ventricular dilation and wall stress (Laplace's law);

![](_page_8_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Figure 3. Dynamic cardiomyoplasty. The left latissimus dorsi muscle is transposed into the left hemi-thorax and wrapped around the left and right ventricles.**

- c) arresting the remodelling process of heart failure, resulting in reduced deterioration in ventricular systolic and diastolic function.
- The Cardiomyoplasty-Skeletal Muscle Assist Randomised Trial (C-SMART) was a prospective, randomised controlled trial that compared dynamic cardiomyoplasty with medical therapy alone. It was, however, terminated due to poor recruitment of approximately 100 patients and showed no survival benefit after 12 months with dynamic cardiomyoplasty.

### 19 **What are the principles of the surgical ventricular restoration procedure (Figures 4 and 5)?**

- The surgical ventricular restoration procedure excludes areas of nonfunctioning left ventricle, resulting in reduced left ventricular volume and wall stress (Laplace's law), and return of an elliptical shape to the left ventricle.
- During the procedure, coronary artery disease and mitral valve disease are also addressed.
- The operative procedure is usually performed for akinesia or dyskinesia of the anterior left ventricular wall and involves:
  - a) a left ventriculotomy through scar tissue, 2cm lateral to the left anterior descending artery;
  - b) subtotal endocardial resection over the septum and posterior wall, and cryotherapy at the limits of the resection for patients with recurrent ventricular arrhythmias;
  - c) a circumferential endoventricular (Fontan) circular suture is passed 1-2cm outside the limit of healthy muscle and then tied around a balloon mannequin to reduce the size of the left ventricle to a diastolic volume of 50-60mL/m2;
  - d) the residual apical defect is closed with a Dacron® patch to produce an elliptical-shaped left ventricle;
  - e) the ventriculotomy is then closed with two-layered 2/0 Prolene® buttressed by Teflon® strips.

**Figure 4. Surgical ventricular restoration. A) Aneurysmal dilation of the antero-apical left ventricular wall with a line of demarcation between viable muscle and scar tissue. B) Following ventriculotomy, a balloon mannequin is placed and inflated within the left ventricle. The left ventricular apex is then repositioned using a Fontan stitch and plication of the scar tissue. C) An elliptical shape of the left ventricle is produced by using a Dacron® patch attached from the ventricular septum to the ventriculotomy.**

B) Following remodelling of the left ventricle, a Dacron® patch is placed from the ventricular septum to the ventriculotomy. C) Twolayered ventriculotomy closure.**

### 20 **Describe the mechanisms of action of passive ventricular constraint devices (Figure 6)**

- Passive constraint devices (such as CorCap®) are designed to promote reverse ventricular remodelling by reducing further ventricular dilation and hence ventricular wall stress (Laplace's law).
- The Acorn Clinical Trial was a multi-centre, prospective, randomised trial with 300 patients using a passive ventricular constraint device, which showed improvement in quality of life, composite endpoint (death, progression of heart failure), left ventricular dilation, left ventricular end-systolic volume and left ventricular sphericity index.

- b) other cardiac disease including refractory ventricular arrhythmias;
- c) malignancies (except central nervous system tumours);
- d) refractory infection.

## 26 Describe the criteria used for matching donor to recipient in cardiac transplantation

- Geographical location, to limit the organ ischaemia time.
- Candidate status:
  - a) la: patients requiring mechanical circulatory support for acute haemodynamic decompensation, mechanical ventilation, highdose intravenous inotropes or with evidence of a significant device-related complication;
  - b) Ib: patients with a ventricular-assist device implanted or on a continuous infusion of intravenous inotropes;
  - c) II: all other patients.
- ABO blood group compatibility.
- Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) compatibility.
- Matching patient's size (height and weight).
- Time on waiting list.
- Cytomegalovirus (CMV) positive donors given to CMV positive recipients.
- Organ matching is usually arranged through a central transplant coordination list, such as the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS).

## 27 Describe the operative sequence for cardiac transplantation (Figure 8)

- The recipient procedure begins about 90 minutes before the donor heart is due to arrive, to minimize the organ ischaemia time.
- Following a median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass is instituted via the ascending aorta and snared venous cannulae, which are positioned directly into both venae cavae.
- The donor heart is inspected for a foramen ovale, palpable coronary artery disease or dilated cardiac chambers. If the donor heart is

**Figure 8. Cardiac transplantation. A) Dilated native heart excised with incisions (dotted lines) in the inferior vena cava, superior vena cava, aorta, pulmonary artery and left atrium (not seen). B) Pericardial cavity with native great vessels following explantation of the native heart. C) Implantation of donor heart with anastomosis of the left atrium (not seen), inferior vena cava, superior vena cava, pulmonary artery and aorta.**

suitable for transplantation, the recipient heart can then be explanted using the following steps:

- a) the right atrium is excised at the junction with the inferior and superior venae cavae;
- b) the aorta and pulmonary artery are divided just above the sino-tubular junction;
- c) the left atrium is excised to leave an island of pulmonary veins.
- The donor heart is then implanted in the following order (modified bicaval technique):
  - a) left atrium;
  - b) inferior vena cava;
  - c) superior vena cava;
  - d) pulmonary artery;
  - e) aorta.

## 28 What are the complications of cardiac transplantation and immunosuppression?

- Early graft failure.
- Rejection (see below).
- Infection.
- Allograft vasculopathy 50% over 5 years.
- Malignancy especially lymphomas and malignant tumours of the skin (e.g. Kaposi's sarcoma).

### 29 What is the classification of organ rejection?

- Hyperacute rejection, which is a complement-mediated response by pre-existing antibodies that are circulating in the recipient. They bind to donor ABO blood group antigens.
- Acute rejection, where the T-lymphocytes respond to differences between the human leucocyte antigens (HLA) of the donor and recipient.
- Chronic rejection, which manifests itself as allograft vasculopathy with diffuse initmal hyperplasia in the coronary arteries of a transplanted heart.

### 30 **What are the agents used for immunosuppression following cardiac transplantation?**

- Short induction phase (first 3 days following transplantation):
  - a) anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG);
  - b) azathioprine;
  - c) corticosteroids.

### • Permanent maintenance phase:

- a) cyclosporine A or tacrolimus, which are calcineurin inhibitors that inhibit the transcription of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and Tlymphocyte signal transduction;
- b) azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), which are purine synthesis inhibitors;
- c) corticosteroids, which inhibit the production of cytokines (such as IL-1, TNF-a and interferons).

### • Newer agents include:

- a) OKT3, which is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the CD3 receptor on T-lymphocytes;
- b) daclizumab and basiliximab, which are monoclonal antibodies that bind to the IL-2 receptors of T-lymphocytes;
- c) sirolimus (rapamycin), which stops IL-2-induced activation of Tlymphocytes.

### 31 **How are left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) classified (Figure 9)?**

- Mechanism of action:
  - a) pulsatile electric or pneumatic, such as the Thoratec HeartMate I® or Novacor®;
  - b) non-pulsatile (continuous flow) centrifugal or axial flow, such as the Thoratec Heart Mate II®, Jarvik 2000 or Micromed DeBakey VAD®.

  - b) transcranial:
  - c) transcutaneous.

## 32 What are the main uses of a left ventricular assist device?

- Bridge to transplantation, which has been shown to increase the survival of patients following cardiac transplantation.
- Bridge to recovery, following an acute myocardial injury, post-cardiac surgery or viral myocarditis.
- Destination therapy, for patients with end-stage heart failure ineligible for cardiac transplantation.

## 33 What are the complications of left ventricular assist devices?

- Mortality (5-10% at 30 days).
- Bleeding.
- Infection (driveline, pocket).
- Right ventricular failure.
- Thrombo-embolic events.
- Haemolysis.
- Device malfunction (rare).

#### 34 What did the REMATCH trial show?

- REMATCH = Randomised Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure.
- The REMATCH trial was a prospective, randomised controlled study in 129 patients with:
  - a) end-stage heart failure (NYHA class IV);
  - b) a left ventricular ejection fraction <25%;
  - c) VO<sub>2</sub> max <12mL/min/kg.
- The patients were randomised to either:
  - a) group I (n=68) left ventricular assist device (Thoratec HeartMate  $I^{\otimes}$ ); or
  - b) group II (n=61) optimal medical therapy.

- The study demonstrated a survival advantage for patients in the LVAD group:
  - a) 1-year survival LVAD 52% vs. optimal medical treatment 25%;
  - b) 2-year survival LVAD 23% vs. optimal medical treatment 8%.
- There were, however, more adverse serious events in the LVAD group, such as infection, bleeding, haemolysis, thrombo-embolism, neurological dysfunction and device failure.
- The study concluded that LVAD therapy is an acceptable alternative in selected patients who are not candidates for cardiac transplantation.

#### 35 What did the MADIT trial show?

- MADIT = Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial.
- The MADIT trial was a prospective, randomised controlled study in 196 patients with:
  - a) previous myocardial infarction;
  - b) a left ventricular ejection fraction of <35%;
  - c) a documented episode of asymptomatic unsustained ventricular tachycardia or an inducible, non-suppressible ventricular arrhythmia on electrophysiologic study.
- The patients were randomised to either an implanted defibrillator (ICD, n=95) or conventional medical therapy with anti-arrhythmic drugs (n=101).
- The study demonstrated an overall 27% reduction in mortality in patients in the ICD group (15 deaths) compared to standard medical therapy (39 deaths).
- The study concluded that an ICD leads to improved survival in patients with a previous myocardial infarction, low ejection fraction and at high risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmia.

### 36 What did the MUSTIC trial show?

- MUSTIC = Multisite Stimulation in Cardiomyopathies.
- The MUSTIC trial was a prospective, randomised controlled study in 48 patients with:
  - a) severe heart failure (NYHA III or IV);
  - b) a left ventricular ejection fraction of <35%;
  - c) normal sinus rhythm with a QRS interval >150msec.

- Patients received transvenous atrio-biventricular pacemakers and the study compared the response to 3-month periods with or without pacing in the same patients.
- The study concluded that biventricular pacing leads to an improved quality of life and exercise tolerance (improved by 23%), and reduced hospitalisations.

### 37 What did the STICH trial (hypothesis 2) show?

- STICH = Surgical Treatment for Ischaemic Heart Failure.
- The STICH trial was a prospective, randomised study in 2800 patients with:
  - a) coronary artery disease amenable to revascularisation;
  - b) a left ventricular ejection fraction of <35%;
  - c) dominant akinesia or dyskinesia of the anterior left ventricular wall amenable to surgical ventricular restoration.
- Patients were sub-divided into different strata and then randomised to:
  - a) medical therapy alone;
  - b) coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and medical therapy;
  - c) surgical ventricular restoration (SVR), coronary artery bypass grafting and medical therapy.
- Hypothesis 1 CABG with intensive medical therapy improves longterm survival compared to survival with medical therapy alone.
- Hypothesis 2 SVR when added to CABG decreases the rate of death or hospitalisation for a cardiac event as compared with CABG alone.
- The results of the hypothesis 2 study at a median of 48-month followup showed no significant difference in:
  - a) primary outcome (death from any cause or hospitalisation for cardiac causes);
  - b) acute myocardial infarction;
  - c) stroke;
  - d) symptoms (angina class, NYHA dyspnoea class, 6-minute walk test).

### 38 What did the RESTORE group show?

• RESTORE = Reconstructive Endoventricular Surgery returning Torsion Original Radius Elliptical shape to the left ventricle.

- The RESTORE group assessed the effects of surgical ventricular restoration with a prospective registry study in 1198 patients with:
  - a) previous anterior myocardial infarction;
  - b) significant ventricular dilation (left ventricular end-systolic volume index >60mL/m2);
  - c) a regional asynergic (non-contractile) LV circumference of >35%.

### • The study demonstrated:

- a) overall 30-day mortality was 5.3% (8.7% with mitral repair, 4.0% without repair);
- b) overall 5-year survival was 69%;
- c) 5-year freedom from hospital admissions for heart failure was 78%;
- d) improvement in NYHA functional status with 85% of patients in class I-II postoperatively;
- e) left ventricular ejection fraction improved from 29% to 39%;
- f) left ventricular end-systolic volume index decreased from 80 to 57mL/m2.
- The study concluded that surgical ventricular restoration improves ventricular function and symptom status in patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy.

### 39 **What did the Heartmate II® trial show?**

- The Heartmate II® trial was a prospective randomised study in 200 patients with advanced heart failure who were ineligible for transplantation.
- The patients were randomised, in a 2:1 ratio, to:
  - a) group I (n=134) implantation of a continuous flow left ventricular assist device (Thoratec Heartmate II®); or
  - b) group II (n=66) implantation of a pulsatile flow left ventricular assist device (Thoratec Heartmate XVE®).

### • The study demonstrated:

- a) survival advantage at 2 years for patients in the continuous flow LVAD (Heartmate II®) group (Heartmate II® 58% vs. Heartmate I ® 24%);
- b) reduced adverse events for patients in the continuous flow LVAD (Heartmate II®) group.

• The study concluded that treatment with a continuous flow LVAD in patients with advanced heart failure significantly improved the probability of survival free from mortality, stroke and device failure as compared to a pulsatile flow device.
