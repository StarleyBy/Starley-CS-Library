### Arrhythmia surgery

#### How is atrial fibrillation classified?

- Atrial fibrillation (AF) is defined as uncoordinated atrial activity at a rate of bpm.
- It is classified as:
  - a) isolated AF (single episode);
  - b) recurrent AF (≥2 episodes):
    - paroxysmal AF, which lasts less than 7 days and reverts spontaneously;
    - ii) persistent AF, which does not terminate spontaneously and requires drugs or DC cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm;
    - iii) permanent AF, which does not revert into sinus rhythm using drugs or DC cardioversion.

#### 2 What is the incidence of atrial fibrillation?

- AF occurs in 1% of the population.
- It increases with age with an incidence of 0.2-0.3% at, 3-4% at and 6-9% at.
- It is the commonest arrhythmia, occurring in 33% of all patients with an arrhythmia.

#### 3 What are the common causes of atrial fibrillation?

- Idiopathic (primary).
- Mitral valve disease and subsequent left atrial dilation.
- Ischaemic heart disease.
- Hypertension.
- Post-cardiac surgery.
- Alcohol.
- Thyrotoxicosis.

# 4 Which patients in atrial fibrillation should be anticoagulated?

 According to the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, class I indications for anticoagulation in patients with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation (paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent) are shown in Table 1.

### Table 1. AHA guidelines for anticoagulation in patients with atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation.

Prosthetic mechanical valves Warfarin (INR 2.5-3.5)

1 high-risk factor for thrombo-embolism Warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0)

More than 1 moderate-risk factor for Warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0)

thrombo-embolism

1 moderate-risk factor for thrombo-embolism Aspirin 81-325mg or

Warfarin (INR 2.0-3.0)

Low-risk factor for thrombo-embolism Aspirin 81-325mg

INR = international normalised ratio

- High-risk factors include prior thrombo-embolism (stroke, transient ischaemic attack or systemic embolism) and rheumatic mitral stenosis.
- Moderate-risk factors include age >75 years, hypertension, heart failure, impaired left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction <35%) and diabetes mellitus.</li>
- Low-risk factors include female gender, age years, coronary artery disease, thyrotoxicosis.
- For patients with lone AF aged <60 years, anticoagulation is not recommended.

### What are the risk factors for atrial fibrillation following cardiac surgery?

- Age.
- Withdrawal of β-blockers.
- Electrolyte imbalance (potassium, magnesium).
- Hypoxia.
- Ischaemia.
- Pericardial effusion
- Infection, e.g. pneumonia.

#### 6 **What is the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation (Figure 1)?**

• Atrial fibrillation is induced by focal areas of automaticity (mainly around the pulmonary veins) and is maintained by multiple macro reentry circuits within both atria.

**Figure 1. Pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation. Macro re-entrant circuits (red) maintain the uncoordinated activity of the electric wavelets (yellow). RAA = right atrial appendage; LAA = left atrial appendage; SA node = sino-atrial node; AV node = atrioventricular node; PV = pulmonary vein; SVC = superior vena cava; IVC = inferior vena cava.** 

- The requirements of AF are:
  - a) triggers atrial ectopic foci, changes in atrial wall tension;
  - b) substrate atrial abnormality (inflammation/fibrosis);
  - c) modulating factors autonomic nervous system.
- Treatment of paroxysmal AF requires stopping the induction pathways (focal areas of automaticity) by pulmonary vein isolation.
- Treatment of persistent AF, however, requires eliminating the maintaining pathways (macro re-entry circuits) using the Cox-maze procedure.

#### 7 What are the sequelae of atrial fibrillation?

- Irregular heartbeat resulting in palpitations and patient anxiety.
- Compromised haemodynamics causing a 30% loss of cardiac output and in the long-term this may result in cardiomyopathy.
- Stasis of blood flow producing thrombo-embolism causing a stroke or pulmonary embolism.

# 8 What are the treatment options for patients with atrial fibrillation?

- Pharmacological for chemical cardioversion and rate control, e.g. amiodarone, digoxin, β-blocker, calcium channel blocker.
- DC cardioversion.
- Catheter ablation using transvenous radiofrequency ablation has a 60% success rate. It is, however, associated with complications including pulmonary vein stenosis, systemic embolisation, pericardial effusion, tamponade and phrenic nerve paralysis.
- Surgical ablation, which has a 75-80% success rate (see below).

### What are the surgical options for the treatment of atrial fibrillation?

- Cut and sew surgical incisions using the lesion set described by Cox in the maze III operation.
- Radiofrequency ablation, which employs an alternating current at 350kHz-1MHz to heat tissue to 70-80°C for 1 minute, creates a 3-6mm lesion using unipolar or bipolar devices. Transmurality is indicated by electrical conductance and impedance monitoring.
- Microwave, which uses high-frequency electromagnetic radiation to induce oscillation of water molecules.
- Cryoablation, which uses nitrous oxide as a cooling agent for 2 minutes at -60°C to produce a transmural lesion that can be visualised as an 'iceball' (Figure 2).
- Ultrasound, which uses high-frequency sound waves (2-20MHz) emitted by piezoelectric crystals to cause thermal heating and disruption of cell membranes.
- Laser, which uses a monochromatic, phase coherent beam to cause heating and cellular destruction.

**Figure 2. Ice ball visible on the surface of the right atrium during cryoablation.**

#### 10 **What are the principles of the maze operation?**

- A 'maze' is created with a set of blind alleys with one entrance and one exit for atrial electrical activation, thereby directing the electrical impulse along one specified route from the sino-atrial node to the atrioventricular node by interrupting conduction routes and re-entrant pathways (Figure 3).
- Using the maze procedure as opposed to the Guiraudon 'corridor' procedure, atrial transport can be better maintained.
- Left atrial appendage excision is often performed in association with the maze procedure to reduce the area of blood stasis and subsequent thrombus formation.
- The maze procedure is less likely to be successful in patients with large left atria (>5cm) or with longstanding AF (>5 years).

**Figure 3. Mechanism of atrial ablation. A) Two parallel lines of fibrous tissue (scar tissue) interrupt the myocardial continuity and avoid the propagation of the electrical wave. The lines are close enough to stop the macro re-entrant circuit. The scar lesion can be obtained by healing of a surgical incision or by alternative sources of energy that create transmural myocardial injury. B) A pre-determined set of lesions creates a 'maze', which allows the linear propagation of the electrical impulse through a series of 'channels' (red and yellow arrows).**

#### 11 **What are the lesion sets for the maze procedure, when performed with mitral valve surgery (Figure 4)?**

- The full maze procedure consists of lesion sets involving the left and right atrium. In certain patients, however, only a left heart maze is carried out using a cryoablation or radiofrequency ablation clamp or probe device with lesions:
  - a) around the right superior and inferior pulmonary veins;
  - b) around the left superior and inferior pulmonary veins. To gain access to the left pulmonary veins, the heart needs to be retracted cephalad and to the right. Often the ligament of Marshall (black arrow), between the left superior pulmonary vein (LSPV) and the left pulmonary artery (LPA), also needs to be divided;
  - c) from the left superior pulmonary vein to the left atrial appendage, which is then excluded from the atrial cavity with a direct suture;
  - d) from the right inferior pulmonary vein to the left inferior pulmonary vein;
  - e) from the connecting lesion between the left and right inferior pulmonary veins to the middle of the posterior mitral valve annulus;
  - f) from the left atriotomy to the middle of the posterior mitral valve annulus.
- For completion of the full maze procedure, the right atrial lesion set is performed. Initially, incisions in the right atrium (1, 2 and 3) are made to allow insertion of the cryoablation or radiofrequency ablation clamp device to create lesions from the:
  - g) right atrial free wall to the superior vena cava;
  - h) right atrial free wall to the inferior vena cava;
  - i) right atrial free wall to the anteroposterior commissure of the tricuspid valve;
  - j) right atrial appendage to the anteroseptal commissure of the tricuspid valve;
  - k) right atrial appendage to the right atrial free wall, ensuring a 2- 3cm gap is left to allow for electrical conduction.

#### 12 How is atrial flutter managed (Figure 5)?

- Atrial flutter is caused by a single macro re-entry circuit.
- Patients usually present with a variable block (e.g. 2:1, 3:1 or 4:1), which represents an atrial rate of 300 bpm and a ventricular response of or 75 bpm, respectively.
- Treatment options include amiodarone, calcium channel blockers, DC cardioversion, catheter ablation or surgical ablation of the flutter isthmus.
- The atrial flutter isthmus runs from the inferior vena caval opening along the Eustachian valve and the coronary sinus, to the tricuspid valve.

**Figure 5. Macro re-entrant circuit of atrial flutter. The electric impulse crosses the isthmus between the orifices of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and the coronary sinus (CS). An ablation lesion is placed at this point, effectively blocking the electric loop. RAA = right atrial appendage; TV = tricuspid valve; SVC = superior vena cava.**
