#### 1 **Describe the principles of invasive arterial monitoring (Figure 1)**

- The arterial line is usually placed in the non-dominant radial artery but the brachial and femoral arteries can also be cannulated.
- Invasive arterial cannulation allows continuous monitoring of blood pressure and serial arterial blood gas analysis.
- Normal blood gas values include:
  - a) pH 7.35-7.45;
  - b) PaO2.3kPa; 75-100mmHg;

![](_page_0_Figure_9.jpeg)

**Figure 1. Arterial pressure waveform.**

- c) PaCO2 4.7-6.0kPa; 35-45mmHg;
- d) bicarbonate 22-26mmol/L;
- e) base excess -2 to +2mmol/L;
- f) lactate 0.5-2mmol/L;
- g) potassium 3.5-5mmol/L;
- h) ionised calcium 1.15-1.29mmol/L;
- i) glucose 3.3-5.6mmol/L (fasting).

(For pressures, to convert from kPa to mmHg, multiply by 7.5.)

- The arterial pressure waveform allows determination of:
  - a) arterial blood pressure;
  - b) myocardial contractility, which is represented by the slope of the upstroke (dP/dt);
  - c) systemic vascular resistance, which is represented by the slope of the diastolic decay.
- The dicrotic notch represents closure of the aortic valve and subsequent retrograde flow of blood against the closed valve. It occurs at the end of ventricular systole.
- Complications of arterial line cannulation include bleeding, infection, local ischaemia, thrombosis and damage to nearby nerves.

# 2 **Describe the principles of pulse oximetry**

- Pulse oximetry is based on the different absorption characteristics of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood to red and infrared light, thereby allowing continuous non-invasive monitoring of arterial oxygen saturation.
- The pulse oximetry probe is placed on a well perfused digit or ear lobe and has a:
  - a) source a pair of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that produce beams of red (l660nm) and infrared (l910nm) light, approximately every 0.03 secs;
  - b) receiver a photodetector that measures the intensity of the transmitted light on the opposite side of the probe to the LEDs.
- Oxygenated haemoglobin absorbs more infrared light and transmits more red light than deoxygenated haemoglobin.
- Pulse oximetry is inaccurate in patients with hypothermia, peripheral vasoconstriction, non-pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass flow, Raynaud's disease, anaemia, hypotension, nail polish, nicotine stains, bright light, electrical interference, high carboxyhaemoglobin levels, jaundice and in the presence of methylene blue.

#### 3 **Describe the principles of central venous access (Figure 2)**

- Central venous access can be used for:
  - a) monitoring right atrial filling pressures;
  - b) administration of drugs;
  - c) administration of fluids;

- d) parenteral nutrition;
- e) transvenous temporary pacing wires;
- f) pulmonary artery (Swan-Ganz) catheters.
- The tip of the central venous line should sit at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium, approximately 15-18cm from the point of entry. Venous catheters can be placed in the:
  - a) internal jugular vein, which is located at the:
    - i) midpoint between the mastoid process and suprasternal notch, just lateral to the common carotid artery;
    - ii) apex of the triangle of the sternal and clavicular heads of sternocleidomastoid;
  - b) subclavian vein, which is located just beneath the junction of the middle and outer third of the clavicle in the deltopectoral groove;
  - c) femoral vein, which is located just medial to the femoral artery pulsation at the mid-inguinal point.
- The normal central venous pressure waveform represents the different stages of the cardiac cycle (Table 1).
- Complications of central venous line insertion include bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, damage to adjacent structures (including the common carotid artery and brachial plexus), arrhythmias, haemothorax, chylothorax and air embolism.

#### 4 **Describe the principles of a pulmonary artery (Swan-Ganz) catheter (Figure 3)**

- Pulmonary artery catheters are usually inserted in patients with low cardiac output to guide inotropic use and optimize left-sided filling pressures. This enables the determination of pulmonary artery pressures, pulmonary artery wedge pressures, systemic vascular resistance, cardiac output and mixed venous saturation.
- The tip of the pulmonary artery catheter is usually 40-45cm from the skin but this can vary considerably.
- Pulmonary artery catheters have four lumens (Figure 4):
  - a) proximal lumen, which is located approximately 25-30cm from the tip and lies in the right atrium. It allows for:
    - i) administration of drugs;
    - ii) injection of cold saline for cardiac output measurements;
    - iii) central venous pressure measurements;

- b) thermistor lumen, which lies 3-4cm from the tip of the catheter and allows cardiac output measurement using the thermodilution method;
- c) balloon lumen for inflation and deflation of the flotation balloon;
- d) distal lumen, which is located at the tip of the catheter and allows for measurement of:
  - i) pulmonary artery pressure;
  - ii) mixed venous saturation;
  - iii) pulmonary artery wedge pressure.
- Complications of pulmonary artery catheter insertion include ventricular tachyarrhythmias, knotting of the catheter, pulmonary artery rupture, pulmonary infarction, damage to the tricuspid or pulmonary valves, as well as those attributable to central venous line insertion.

#### 5 **Describe the principles of mixed venous oxygen saturation measurement**

- Mixed venous saturations represent the difference between oxygen delivered and oxygen consumed by the tissues and hence can be used as an indirect measure of cardiac output.
- Mixed venous saturations should be assessed from blood obtained from the pulmonary artery to ensure adequate mixing of blood from the coronary sinus (maximal oxygen extraction) and the superior and inferior venae cavae.
- Mixed venous saturations can be measured continuously using reflection spectrophotometry or intermittently in a blood gas analyser.
- Normal mixed venous saturations are 60-80%.
- Low mixed venous saturations represent:
  - a) decreased oxygen delivery, secondary to:
    - i) low cardiac output;
    - ii) anaemia;
    - iii) reduced arterial oxygen saturation;
  - b) increased oxygen consumption, secondary to hyperthermia, pain and shivering.
- High mixed venous saturations may be caused by:
  - a) decreased oxygen consumption or extraction, secondary to hypothermia, sepsis or shunting;
  - b) increased oxygen delivery (raised inspired oxygen concentration, FiO2);
  - c) a wedged pulmonary artery catheter.

**Figure 5. Systemic and pulmonary pressures and oxygen saturations.** 

#### 8 **Describe the cardiac cycle (Figure 6)**

- The cardiac cycle is divided into systole (ventricular contraction) and diastole (ventricular relaxation).
- Left ventricular systole occurs in four stages:
  - a) isovolumetric contraction (0.05s), which occurs when the left ventricle contracts against a closed aortic valve (as the aortic pressures are higher than the ventricular pressures) and the mitral valve is forced closed. During this phase, the ventricular pressure increases, whilst the ventricular volumes remain constant;
  - b) rapid ejection phase (0.15s), which occurs once the left ventricular pressure exceeds the aortic pressure, causing the aortic valve to open, ejecting 70% of the stroke volume;

![](_page_8_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 6. Cardiac cycle. LV = left ventricle; LA = left atrium; ECG = electrocardiogram; LVEDV = left ventricular end-diastolic volume; LVESV = left ventricular end-systolic volume.**

- c) slow ejection (isotonic contraction phase, 0.10s), during which the remaining 30% of the stroke volume leaves the ventricle, as the force of contraction is reduced at this stage and the aortic and left ventricular pressures begin to fall;
- d) protodiastole (0.05s), which occurs in the transition from the end of systole to the point when the aortic valve closes.
- Left ventricular diastole occurs in four stages:
  - a) isovolumetric relaxation (0.05s), which occurs when the ventricular pressure falls rapidly whilst the ventricular volume remains constant, as the aortic and mitral valves are closed;
  - b) rapid early ventricular filling (0.10s), which occurs following opening of the mitral valve, causing rapid emptying of the left atrium, thereby increasing the left ventricular pressure and volume;
  - c) diastasis (0.20s), during which slow late ventricular filling occurs due to the reduced pressure gradient between the left atrium and left ventricle following early diastolic filling;
  - d) atrial systole (0.10s), which occurs with contraction of the left atrium and accounts for up to 30% of ventricular filling. Ejection of blood from the atria causes a small rise in left ventricular pressures.
- The duration of the cardiac cycle depends on the heart rate but in normal healthy individuals lasts approximately 0.8 seconds (with a heart rate of 75 bpm).
- Normal left ventricular end-diastolic volume is 120mL, left ventricular end-systolic volume, 50mL and stroke volume, 70mL (approximately 1mL/kg of body weight).

# 9 **What is left ventricular pre-load (Figure 7)?**

- Preload corresponds to the stretching of myocytes within the left ventricle just before initiation of contraction and is represented by the left ventricular end-diastolic volume.
- Preload represents left ventricular filling and is influenced by:
  - a) compliance of the left ventricle;
  - b) circulating blood volume;
  - c) presence of atrial systole;
  - d) length of diastole.

#### 10 **What is contractility (Figure 8)?**

• Myocardial contractility represents the ability of the cardiac muscle to contract at a given preload and afterload.

![](_page_10_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 7. Left ventricular pressure volume loops with changing preload. A = end-diastolic volume. C = end-systolic volume. A to B = isovolumetric contraction, B to C = ventricular ejection, C to D = isovolumetric relaxation, D to A = ventricular filling. If the preload increases with end-diastolic volume at E, the left ventricular ejection (F to C) increases (Frank-Starling law) to restore the end-systolic volume (C) back to baseline.**

![](_page_10_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Figure 8. Left ventricular pressure volume loops with changing myocardial contractility. A = end-diastolic volume. C = end-systolic volume. A to B = isovolumetric contraction, B to C = ventricular ejection, C to D = isovolumetric relaxation, D to A = ventricular filling. If the myocardial contractility increases, the left ventricular ejection (B to E) increases, producing an increased stroke volume.**

#### • It is affected by:

- a) the autonomic nervous system, with contractility increased by sympathetic stimulation and decreased by parasympathetic stimulation;
- b) drugs, with contractility increased by inotropes and decreased by b-blockers;
- c) local metabolites, with contractility decreased by hydrogen ions, carbon dioxide and hypoxia;
- d) the Bowditch effect, where an increased heart rate results in increased contractility (force-frequency effect).

# 11 **What is left ventricular afterload (Figure 9)?**

• Afterload is the tension generated by the left ventricle during contraction and is represented by the left ventricular end-systolic pressure.

![](_page_11_Figure_9.jpeg)

**Figure 9. Left ventricular pressure volume loops with changing afterload. A = end-diastolic volume. C = end-systolic volume. A to B = isovolumetric contraction, B to C = ventricular ejection, C to D = isovolumetric relaxation, D to A = ventricular filling. If the afterload increases, the isovolumetric contraction phase (A to E) increases to overcome the increased resistance to ejection, resulting in a reduced ventricular ejection phase (E to F).** 

- Afterload represents the resistance to left ventricular contraction and is influenced by:
  - a) systemic vascular resistance;
  - b) area of the aortic valve and left ventricular outflow tract;
  - c) left ventricular wall stress (Laplace's law).

# 12 **What is cardiac work?**

- Cardiac work of the left ventricle represents the work done by the left ventricle to eject a volume of blood into the aorta.
- It can be calculated by the area within the left ventricular pressure volume loop (Figure 10).

![](_page_12_Figure_9.jpeg)

**Figure 10. Left ventricular work.**

#### 13 **What is compliance?**

- Compliance is a measure of the change in volume per unit change in pressure.
- Compliance is inversely proportional to the slope of the diastolic component of the left ventricular pressure volume loop (Figure 11).

# 16 **Describe how inotropes increase cardiac contractility**

- Most inotropes work by increasing the intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, which occurs by:
  - a) stimulation of adenylate cyclase, which catalyses the conversion of ATP to cAMP (dopamine, adrenaline, noradrenaline);
  - b) inhibition of phosphodiesterase enzyme, which normally converts cAMP to inactive 5' AMP (milrinone, enoximone).
- cAMP augments calcium influx into myocardial cells thereby increasing contractility.

#### 17 **Describe how to convert an infusion rate into a dose of intravenous medication**

• Dose (mg/kg/min) = infusion rate (mL/hr) x drug in pump (mg) [Volume in pump(mL)/1000] x 60 x weight (kg)

- Hence, if dopamine is made up with 200mg in 50mL of 5% dextrose:
  - dopamine dose (mg/kg/min) = [200/ (50/1000 x 60] x infusion rate / weight = 66.67 x infusion rate / weight
- Similarly, if noradrenaline is made up with 4mg in 50mL of 5% dextrose, hence:
  - noradrenaline dose (mg/kg/min) = [4/ (50/1000 x 60] x infusion rate / weight = 1.33 x rate / weight
- If adrenaline is made up with 2mg in 50mL of 5% dextrose, hence:
  - adrenaline dose (mg/kg/min) = [2/ (50/1000 x 60] x infusion rate / weight = 0.667 x rate / weight

# 18 **How is stroke volume controlled?**

- Stroke volume is determined by preload, contractility and afterload, and is governed by the:
  - a) Frank-Starling law, where the force of myocardial contraction is proportional to the initial myocardial fibre length (and therefore to left ventricular end-diastolic volume);
  - b) Anrep effect, where the heart autoregulates according to changing afterload. For example, if the afterload increases at a given contractility, the left ventricular end-systolic volume increases, thereby increasing the stroke volume on the next cardiac cycle.

# 19 **How is the heart rate controlled?**

- Although the intrinsic heart rate is governed by the automaticity of the sino-atrial node, there are several factors that can influence the cardiac rate, including the:
  - a) autonomic nervous system with sympathetic b1 adrenergic stimulation causing an increased heart rate and parasympathetic cholinergic stimulation causing a reduced heart rate;
  - b) Bainbridge reflex, where the heart rate increases in response to a sudden increase in venous return.

# 20 **Describe the principles of blood pressure control**

- Maintenance of blood pressure is controlled by several different mechanisms:
  - a) neural regulation, with afferent inputs from baroreceptors in the aorta and carotid sinus, conveyed by the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves to the depressor zone of the vasomotor centre in the brainstem. Efferent signals are transmitted to the heart and blood vessels via sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, which can produce changes in myocardial contraction, heart rate and vasomotor tone;
  - b) hormonal regulation, such as with adrenaline and noradrenaline, to control the heart rate, myocardial contraction and vasomotor tone; and renin-angiotensin, which helps to control fluid balance and arteriolar vasomotor tone;
  - c) local responses, including intrinsic cardiac responses, such as the Frank-Starling mechanism, Anrep effect, Bainbridge reflex, as well as local vascular autoregulation (see below).

# 21 **Describe the renin-angiotensin system**

- The renal juxtaglomerular apparatus releases renin in response to an acute reduction in plasma volume or mean arterial pressure.
- Renin converts circulating angiotensinogen, which is produced in the liver, into inactive angiotensin I.
- Angiotensin I is cleaved into active angiotensin II by a converting enzyme, which is produced by pulmonary and renal endothelium.
- Angiotensin II results in restoration of plasma volume and blood pressure by stimulating:
  - a) arteriolar vasoconstriction;
  - b) aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex, resulting in sodium and water reabsorption and potassium excretion at the renal distal convoluted tubule;
  - c) anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) release from the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland, resulting in water reabsorption at the renal collecting ducts;
  - d) thirst via hypothalamic receptors.
- Both angiotensin II and aldosterone negatively feedback on the juxtaglomerular apparatus and renin release.

# 22 **Describe the factors that control local tissue blood flow**

- Arteriolar diameter is the principal determinant of local blood flow and is determined by a number of factors:
  - a) neural control of vasomotor tone by sympathetic a1-adrenergic receptors causing vasoconstriction and sympathetic b2 adrenergic receptors producing vasodilation;
  - b) locally produced vasodilating (nitric oxide, bradykinin, histamine) and vasoconstricting (prostaglandins, angiotensin II, endothelins) agents;
  - c) accumulation of metabolites (hydrogen ions, carbon dioxide, potassium ions) locally produces vasodilation;
  - d) autoregulation, which is an adaptive mechanism of certain organs (brain, kidney and heart) to maintain constant local blood flow, independently of any changes in the global perfusion pressure.

#### 23 **Describe the factors that control coronary blood flow (CBF)**

- CBF = coronary perfusion pressure / coronary vascular resistance.
- Coronary perfusion pressure is the difference between diastolic blood pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.
- Coronary perfusion pressure is reduced when left ventricular enddiastolic pressure increases or systemic blood pressure decreases, especially diastolic blood pressure, as the majority of coronary blood flow to the left ventricle occurs during diastole.
- Similarly, an increase in heart rate shortens the diastolic time period and therefore reduces coronary perfusion.
- Coronary autoregulation attempts to maintain the coronary perfusion pressure within a consistent range during changing systemic blood pressures and is governed by the coronary vascular resistance.
- Coronary vascular resistance is controlled by the pre-capillary resistance vessels which are modified by:
  - a) autonomic regulation, with sympathetic stimulation causing vasoconstriction and parasympathetic stimulation causing vasodilation;
  - b) endothelial factors, with nitric oxide causing vasodilation and endothelin causing vasoconstriction;
  - c) metabolic factors, with adenosine and prostacyclin causing vasodilation.

#### 24 **Describe the factors that control myocardial oxygen supply**

• Myocardial oxygen supply (MO2) is determined by arterial oxygen (O2) content and coronary blood flow (CBF):

MO2 delivery (mL/min) = CBF(dL/100g/min) x arterial O2 content (mL/dL).

• Arterial O2 content =

(1.34 x Hb [g/dL] x 
$$O_2$$
 sats) + dissolved  $O_2$  (0.0031 x  $PaO_2$ )

Each gram of haemoglobin combines with 1.34mL O2 and only a small amount of oxygen dissolves in blood.

• Hence, the factors that control myocardial oxygen supply include coronary blood flow (left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, diastolic blood pressure, diastolic filling time, coronary vascular resistance), haemoglobin and arterial oxygen saturations.

# 25 **What is Poiseuille's law?**

• Poiseuille's law describes the properties that govern flow of a viscous liquid through a vessel with:

Flow = 
$$\Delta P \times \pi \times r^4$$
  
8 x  $\eta \times L$ 

where DP is the change in pressure across the vessel; r is the radius of the vessel; h is the viscosity of the fluid flowing through the vessel; L is the length of the vessel.

• The resistance to flow through the vessel can be calculated by:

8 x h x L p x r4

• Hence, if the radius of the vessel halves, the resistance increases by a factor of 16 and the flow decreases by a factor of 16.

#### 26 **Describe the factors that maintain the resting potential within the cardiomyocyte**

- Cardiomyocytes contain voltage-gated ion channels that allow certain charged particles to cross the cell membrane.
- These ion channels maintain a voltage gradient across the cell membrane with sodium and calcium concentrations higher outside the cell and potassium concentration higher inside.

- This concentration gradient is maintained by the Na/K ATPdependent pump, which pumps potassium ions in and sodium ions out of the cell.
- At rest, cardiomyocytes have potassium channels open whilst sodium and calcium channels are closed, hence potassium ions move out of the cells, leaving negatively charged ions behind and a resting potential of approximately -90mV in ventricular muscle cells.

#### 27 **Describe the phases of the cardiomyocyte action potential (Figure 12)**

- Depolarisation of a neighbouring cell causes opening of the cardiomyocyte sodium channels. This triggers a series of changes associated with propagation of the cardiac action potential:
  - a) phase 0: influx of sodium ions causes the membrane potential to become transiently positive;
  - b) phase 1: opening of the potassium channels allows potassium to leave the cell, restoring the membrane potential to approximately zero;

![](_page_19_Figure_8.jpeg)

**Figure 12. Cardiomyocyte action potential. K+ = potassium ions; Ca2+ = calcium ions; Na+ = sodium ions.**

- c) phase 2: opening of the calcium channels allows calcium to enter the cell, which balances with the exit of potassium during this plateau phase. The calcium entering during this phase initiates the excitation-contraction coupling process;
- d) phase 3: closure of the calcium channels, associated with the exit of potassium, allows repolarisation and restoration of the membrane potential to -90mV;
- e) phase 4: resting period which prepares the cell for the next depolarization.

#### 28 **How does the cardiac action potential differ in the Purkinje cells and pacemaker cells (Figure 13)?**

- Purkinje cells have a more negative resting potential and the upstroke of phase 0 is more rapid.
- The action potential of the pacemaker cells of the sino-atrial node and atrioventricular node differ from normal cardiomyocytes as follows:
  - a) automaticity, as they are able to depolarize spontaneously in a rhythmic manner without requiring initiation of the action potential by an adjacent cell;
  - b) phase 0 is less rapid than normal cardiomyocytes;
  - c) phase 4 progressively increases due to gradual spontaneous depolarization rather than being almost flat with normal cardiomyocytes.

![](_page_20_Figure_11.jpeg)

**Figure 13. Cardiomyocyte action potential throughout the conduction pathway.**

# 29 **What is the refractory period?**

- The refractory period refers to the phase of the action potential where the cell cannot be restimulated and acts as a protective mechanism, thereby allowing atrial and ventricular filling and emptying.
- Phase of the cardiac action potential represents the absolute refractory period, where the cardiomyocyte is completely unexcitable.
- Ventricular cardiomyocytes have longer refractory periods than atrial cells.

# 30 **Describe the structure of a myofibril (Figure 14)**

- Each myofibril contains a series of repeated subunits (sarcomeres) that consist of:
  - a) myosin molecules, which are arranged in thick filaments with thin tails and globular heads (with myosin ATPase);
  - b) actin molecules, which are arranged in thin helical filaments that interdigitate with the thick myosin filaments via crossbridges.

![](_page_21_Picture_10.jpeg)

**Figure 14. Structure of a myofibril.**

- These molecules are responsible for myocardial contraction (with calcium ions acting as the messengers) under the regulatory control of:
  - a) tropomyosin (TM), which lies in the grooves between the actin filaments in the relaxed state, thereby blocking the attachment of the myosin cross-bridges and preventing contraction;
  - b) troponin (Tp), which is a complex of three subunits:
    - i) TpT, which binds to tropomyosin, thereby forming the Tp-TM complex;
    - ii) TpI, which binds to actin to keep the Tp-TM complex in place;
    - iii) TpC, which binds to the calcium ions to produce the conformational change.

#### 31 **Describe the process of cardiac excitation contraction coupling (Figure 15)**

- Excitation contraction coupling describes the process where triggering of the cardiac action potential in a cardiomyocyte initiates a series of changes that result in mechanical muscular contraction. These include the following:
  - a) calcium ions enter the cells during phase 2 of the cardiac action potential;
  - b) an influx of these calcium ions cause a conformational change in the troponin-tropomyosin complex;
  - c) this conformational change allows the myosin globular head to form cross-bridges with the actin filaments, interdigitating the thick and thin filaments, to produce mechanical contraction.
- Inotropes increase the concentration of cytosolic calcium ions, resulting in increased ATP being hydrolysed, thereby producing an increased force of myocardial contraction.

![](_page_23_Figure_2.jpeg)

![](_page_23_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Figure 15. Excitation-contraction coupling. A) Myosin binding sites on the actin molecules are blocked in the relaxed state. B) Conformational change of the troponin-tropomyosin complex (induced by calcium influx) reveals the myosin-binding site allowing cross-bridge formation. C) This induces interdigitation of the myosin and actin molecules and muscular contraction.**

# 32 **Draw the oxygen dissociation curve (Figure 16)**

- The relationship between arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) and arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) is non-linear.
- Above a PaO2 of 8kPa (60mmHg), rises and falls in the PaO2 make very little difference to the SaO2.
- Below a PaO2 of 8kPa (60mmHg), however, a small drop in the PaO2 produces a large fall in the SaO2.
- In view of these changes, it is important to keep the PaO2 >10kPa (75mmHg) to leave a margin of safety.

![](_page_24_Figure_7.jpeg)

**Figure 16. Oxygen dissociation curve. DPG = 2,3-diphosphoglycerate.**

#### 33 **Describe the Bohr effect**

• Factors such as acidosis, hypercapnia and increasing temperature cause a right shift of the oxygen dissociation curve, thereby encouraging oxygen release to the tissues.

# 34 **Describe the principles of Starling's forces (Figure 17)**

- Starling's forces govern the movement of water and solutes across a capillary membrane and are principally controlled by:
  - a) capillary hydrostatic pressure;
  - b) plasma colloid oncotic pressure (negatively charged proteins);
  - c) interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure;
  - d) interstitial fluid colloid oncotic pressure (negatively charged proteins).
- In combination with these forces, fluid movement is also dependent on capillary permeability, the surface area of the capillaries and lymph flow.

#### 35 **What are the principles of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP)(Figures 18 and 19)?**

- An IABP acts as a counter-pulsation device that is timed to inflate during diastole thereby augmenting organ perfusion and deflate just prior to systole, thereby reducing left ventricular afterload.
- It is usually placed via the femoral artery and lies in the descending thoracic aorta, with the tip of the balloon position just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery.
- Malposition of the IABP can result in:
  - a) mesenteric or renal ischaemia, if the balloon is too low;
  - b) cerebral or left upper limb ischaemia, if the balloon is too high.
- Other complications of IABP insertion include bleeding, infection, thrombo-embolism, leg ischaemia, thrombocytopaenia, balloon rupture and haemolysis.

![](_page_26_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Figure 18. Intra-aortic balloon pump. BP = blood pressure.**

![](_page_27_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 19. Intra-aortic balloon pump tip (arrow) located on a chest Xray. Ideally, the IABP tip is placed in the descending aorta, 1-2cm distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. Radiologically, this can be identified either 2cm below the top of the aortic knuckle or in the 2rd-3rd intercostal space anteriorly.** 

- An IABP improves the myocardial oxygen supply to demand ratio by:
  - a) reducing the tension-time index (systolic wall tension) by reducing the impedance to left ventricular ejection;
  - b) increasing the diastolic pressure-time index by increasing coronary flow during diastole.
- IABPs are usually inserted in patients with:
  - a) myocardial ischaemia;
  - b) low cardiac output syndrome;
  - c) volume overload of the left ventricle, such as following acute mitral regurgitation or post-infarct ventricular septal rupture;
  - d) acute myocardial deterioration as a bridge to transplantation or left ventricular assist device implantation.
- IABPs are, however, contra-indicated in patients with severe aortic regurgitation, aortic dissection, abdominal aortic aneurysms and severe peripheral atherosclerosis.

# 36 **Describe the stages of haemostasis (Figure 20)**

- Haemostasis involves the interaction of several different systems to form a stable clot:
  - a) vascular phase, which occurs as an immediate response when damage to a vessel wall induces neural reflexes and local myogenic spasm to reduce local blood flow;
  - b) platelet phase, which occurs when platelets come into contact with endothelial collagen fibres of the damaged vessel. This in turn activates platelet aggregation, mediated by ADP, thromboxane A2, von Willebrand factor, membrane glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors, fibrinogen, serotonin (5HT) and platelet activating factor to form a loose platelet plug;
  - c) clotting phase, which occurs when the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways are activated to convert the loose platelet plug into a stable fibrin clot (see below).

![](_page_28_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Figure 20. Haemostasis, triggered by endothelial damage inducing activation of platelets followed by fibrinogen cross-bridge formation. vWF = von Willebrand Factor.** 

#### 37 **Describe the clotting cascade (Figure 21)**

- The clotting cascade involves activation of a number of coagulation factors (serine proteases) resulting in fibrin (clot) formation. It is controlled by the:
  - a) intrinsic pathway (contact activation pathway);
  - b) extrinsic pathway (tissue factor pathway), which is activated by tissue factor released by the endothelium following vessel damage;
  - c) final common pathway, which is activated by either the intrinsic or extrinsic pathways and results in fibrin formation.
- There are a number of co-factors that play an important role in the coagulation cascade:
  - a) calcium, which is required by tenase and prothrombinase to convert prothrombin into thrombin;
  - b) vitamin K, which is required by the liver for the production of Factors II, VII, IX and X (as well as protein C and protein S).
- There are a number of inherent regulators circulating that control the coagulation cascade:
  - a) protein C, which inactivates Factors Va and VIIIa in the presence of protein S;
  - b) anti-thrombin III, which is a serine protease inhibitor secreted by the endothelium and inhibits thrombin and Factors IXa, Xa and XIa;
  - c) prostacyclin, which inhibits platelet aggregation and causes vasodilation;
  - d) tissue factor pathway inhibitor which is produced by platelets and inhibits Factors Xa and VIIa;
  - e) plasmin (see below).

#### 38 **Describe fibrinolysis**

- Fibrinolysis is the process of clot breakdown and is primarily controlled by plasmin.
- Plasmin is a serine protease that is synthesised in the liver as inactive plasminogen.
- Its main function is to break down the unstable bonds between fibrin molecules to generate fibrin degradation products.

![](_page_30_Figure_4.jpeg)

**Figure 21. Coagulation cascade.**

- It is activated by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase, thrombin, fibrin and Factor XII, and is inactivated by a2-antiplasmin and serpin (serine protease inhibitor).
- It occurs at the same time as fibrin formation to limit thrombus production locally.

#### 39 **What is a thrombo-elastogram (TEG)(Figure 22)?**

- A thrombo-elastogram allows the measurement of the kinetics and tensile strength (visco-elastic properties) of clot formation and fibrinolysis.
- It assesses several different variables in the coagulation process:
  - a) R time (normal range min), that measures the time to initial fibrin formation;
  - b) K time (normal range min) and alpha angle (normal range 54-67°), which measure fibrinogen-platelet interaction;
  - c) maximal amplitude (MA) (normal range 59-68mm), that measures platelet aggregation;
  - d) amplitude 60 minutes after the maximum, which represents the degree of fibrinolysis.
