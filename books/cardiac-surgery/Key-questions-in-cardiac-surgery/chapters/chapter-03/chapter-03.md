- Side effects: tachycardia, hypertension and peripheral vasoconstriction.
- Dose: dopamine acts on different receptors and has different effects depending on the dose:
  - a) between 1-5mg/kg/min, dopaminergic receptors are activated producing vasodilation of coronary, renal, cerebral and splanchnic vasculature;
  - b) between 5-10mg/kg/min, dopamine activates b<sup>1</sup> receptors, producing increased myocardial contractility and increased heart rate. At this dose, dopamine also has some b<sup>2</sup> receptor agonist activity producing peripheral vasodilation;
  - c) above >10mg/kg/min, dopamine mainly stimulates aadrenergic receptors, producing systemic vasoconstriction. Although this rise in systemic vascular resistance produces an increase in blood pressure, it may be at the cost of increased myocardial oxygen demand as the heart has to work in the face of increased resistance.
