# Cardiac anaesthesia and intensive care management

### Describe the monitoring used during cardiac anaesthesia

- Electrocardiogram limb leads and V5.
- Arterial oxygen saturations.
- End-tidal carbon dioxide levels.
- Arterial blood pressure (invasive and non-invasive).
- Central venous pressure.
- Central (core) and peripheral temperature.
- Urine output.
- Cardiac output, using invasive (Swan-Ganz catheter) and noninvasive techniques (LiDCO).
- Pulmonary artery pressure.
- Transoesophageal echocardiogram.

## 2 What are the principles of cardiac anaesthesia?

- Prior to arrival in the anaesthetic room, most elective patients have fasted for hours and have been given a premedication. An example includes using a benzodiazepine (such as temazepam) and an opiate (such as morphine), to reduce anxiety-induced tachycardia and hypertension, and to help facilitate analgesia.
- There are three components to anaesthesia, which include:
  - a) hypnosis to produce a reversible state of non-awareness and amnesia, using:
    - i) intravenous sedatives, such as propofol;
    - i) inhaled anaesthetic agents, such as isoflurane;
  - analgesia to reduce the responses to pain encountered during surgery. Typically, an opiate such as fentanyl or remifentanyl is used, in preference over morphine, as it has less cardiac side effects and is short-acting;
  - c) muscle relaxation using:
    - non-depolarising agents (such as vecuronium or rocuronium), which are competitive inhibitors of the acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction. They have an onset time of minutes, last between 20

- to 60 minutes and can be reversed by an anticholinesterase (such as neostigmine); or
- ii) a depolarising agent (such as suxamethonium), which non-competitively binds with the acetylcholine receptor resulting in depolarisation of the neuromuscular junction. It has a rapid onset of action producing paralysis that lasts for minutes and cannot be reversed.
- The conduct of anaesthesia includes three phases:
  - a) induction:
    - i) hypnosis propofol;
    - ii) analgesia fentanyl or remifentanyl;
    - iii) muscle relaxation suxamethonium;
  - b) maintenance:
    - i) hypnosis propofol and isoflurane;
    - ii) analgesia fentanyl or remifentanyl;
    - iii) muscle relaxation vecuronium or rocuronium;
  - c) reversal.
- During the different stages of cardiac anaesthesia it is important to minimise myocardial oxygen consumption by controlling the heart rate and blood pressure, and optimising preload and afterload. This allows the myocardial work to be kept to a minimum in patients with cardiac disease.
- 3 Describe the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) pre-operative scoring system
- Grade I: healthy patient.
- Grade II: mild systemic disease but no functional limitation.
- Grade III: moderate systemic disease with definite functional limitation.
- Grade IV: severe systemic disease with a constant threat to life.
- Grade V: moribund patient, not expected to survive 24 hours with or without surgery.

### 4 Describe the different grades of intubation

- The different grades of intubation are determined by the degree to which the vocal cords and upper airway can be visualised at the time of intubation and guides future anaesthetists to the degree of difficulty of intubation:
  - a) Grade I: vocal cords visible;
  - b) Grade II: vocal cords partially visible;

- c) Grade III: vocal cords not visible; only the epiglottis can be seen;
- d) Grade IV: vocal cords and epiglottis not visible.
- In the pre-anaesthesia assessment, the difficulty of intubation is assessed using the Mallampati system, by asking the patient to open their mouth wide open:
  - a) I: faucial pillars, soft palate and uvula visible;
  - b) II: faucial pillars and soft palate visible;
  - c) III: only the soft palate visible;
  - d) IV: none of the above soft tissues are visible.

# What are important considerations when transferring a patient from the operating room to the intensive care unit?

- Before transfer, it is important to ensure that the patient is monitored (arterial pressure, central venous pressure, oxygen saturation, cardiac rate and rhythm), haemodynamically stable and not bleeding.
- All intravenous infusions should be checked and refilled if appropriate.
- During transfer, it is important to have:
  - a) monitoring directly visible by the anaesthetist;
  - respiratory equipment including an oxygen tank, connection tubing and a 3L self-inflating reservoir bag connected to the endotracheal tube;
  - c) intravenous infusions and boluses available of sedatives, inotropes and antihypertensives;
  - d) a portable cardiac defibrillator.
- On admission to ITU, all monitoring is recalibrated, the drains are connected to 20cm H<sub>2</sub>O wall suction and a full set of investigations are ordered (including full blood count, urea and electrolytes, coagulation screen, arterial blood gas, electrocardiogram and chest radiograph).
- There should be a clear hand-over of the patient to the intensive care unit team, including pre-operative findings, the intra-operative procedure and a postoperative plan.

# 6 Describe the standard monitoring in the intensive care unit following cardiac surgery

- Electrocardiogram limb leads and V5.
- Arterial oxygen saturation.
- End-tidal carbon dioxide levels.

- Arterial blood pressure (invasive and non-invasive).
- Central venous pressure.
- Central (core) and peripheral temperature.
- Urine output and fluid input.
- Mediastinal drainage.
- Pulmonary artery pressure and cardiac output measurements.

# What are the common causes of mediastinal bleeding in the immediate postoperative period?

- Surgical:
  - a) anastomotic suture lines and cannulation sites;
  - b) side branches of arterial or venous conduits;
  - c) sternal sites, including the periosteum, sternal wire holes and bone marrow;
  - d) raw surfaces, including the internal mammary artery bed, pericardium and thymus.

#### Coagulopathy:

- residual heparin, secondary to inadequate protamine reversal or heparin rebound;
- thrombocytopaenia, secondary to a low platelet count preoperatively and haemodilution on cardiopulmonary bypass (which can drop platelet counts by 20-50%, especially with long bypass times);
- c) platelet dysfunction, secondary to pre-operative medications (aspirin, ticlopidine, clopidogrel) and damage caused by cardiopulmonary bypass (especially with deep hypothermia);
- d) coagulation factor depletion, secondary to pre-operative factors (residual warfarin effect, hepatic dysfunction and von Willebrand disease) and haemodilution with cardiopulmonary bypass and cell salvage;
- e) fibrinolysis, secondary to pre-operative thrombolytic agents and plasminogen activation on cardiopulmonary bypass.

# 8 What are the principles of managing mediastinal bleeding post-cardiac surgery?

- Assessment to help distinguish surgical causes from coagulopathy:
  - a) blood tests haemoglobin, activated clotting time (ACT), international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time ratio (APTTR), platelet count, fibrinogen levels and thrombo-elastogram (TEG);

- b) radiology chest radiograph and echocardiogram (TOE preferably) to check for pleural and pericardial collections;
- c) drainage rate of bleeding (sudden or gradual, 'dump' when rolled) and patency of tubes;
- d) haemodynamic status, especially to identify tamponade.

#### • Treatment:

- a) correct hypothermia;
- b) calcium chloride 1g (10mL of 10%) intravenously if ionised calcium is low (<1.2mmol/L);
- c) treat hypertension;
- d) consider increasing the positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) to 12cm H2O, which increases the intrathoracic pressure to 'tamponade' the bleeding;
- e) protamine should be given in patients with mediastinal bleeding and an APTTR >1.3 or ACT >110% of baseline. Doses of 25- 100mg should be given slowly depending on the degree of residual heparin effect;
- f) platelets should be given in patients with mediastinal bleeding and a platelet count <100 x 109 per litre or if platelet dysfunction is indicated on the thrombo-elastogram. One unit of platelets (50mL) should increase the platelet count by x 109 per litre. The standard transfusion dose recommended is 1 unit per 10kg. One pool of platelets contains units of platelets. They are stored at room temperature, can be used for 5 days and should be ABO compatible but do not need to be cross-matched;
- g) fresh frozen plasma (FFP) should be given in patients with mediastinal bleeding and an INR >1.3. FFP contains all coagulation factors but no platelets. The standard dose is 2-4U (5-10mL/kg), as each unit contains 250mL. It is stored at - 18°C, thawed over 20 minutes and should be used within 2 hours. FFP should be ABO compatible but does not need to be cross-matched. It is also used to treat heparin resistance with anti-thrombin III (ATIII) deficiency. Beriplex® can also be used as a concentrated form of coagulation factors with 500- 1000 units representing 2-4U of FFP;
- h) cryoprecipitate should be given in patients with mediastinal bleeding and a fibrinogen level <150mg/dL. It contains fibrinogen, Factor VII, Factor VIII and Factor XIII. One pool (200mL) contains five units and should increase the fibrinogen levels by 50mg/dL. The standard dose is 0.1U/kg (1-2 pools

- for a 70kg patient). Cryoprecipitate should be ABO compatible but does not need to be cross-matched;
- i) blood should be given if the haemoglobin is <8g/dL. One unit of packed red blood cells (300-350mL) should increase the haemoglobin by 1g/dL. Large volumes of stored blood may cause hypocalcaemia, hyperkalaemia and a dilutional coagulopathy. Blood should be ABO compatible and crossmatched;
- j) cell saver blood, which has been washed of all platelets and coagulation factors;
- k) desmopressin can be used to increase the release of von Willebrand Factor from endothelial stores to aid platelet function. Some studies have shown its effectiveness in patients taking antiplatelet agents up to the time of surgery;
- l) urgent mediastinal re-exploration is required for tamponade, haemodynamically significant hypovolaemia or persistent mediastinal bleeding (>500mL/hr for 1 hour, >400mL/hr for 2 hours or >300mL/hr for 3 hours).

#### 9 **What are the common causes of low cardiac output syndrome and sustained hypotension in the immediate postoperative period?**

- Reduced preload, caused by:
  - a) hypovolaemia, secondary to haemorrhage, polyuria or inadequate fluid replacement;
  - b) restricted cardiac filling, secondary to tamponade or tension pneumothorax;
  - c) tachyarrhythmias, which reduce ventricular diastolic filling time and loss of atrial transport (in patients with atrial fibrillation);
  - d) vasodilation (see below).

### • Impaired myocardial contractility, secondary to:

- a) negative inotropes, such as calcium channel blockers and bblockers;
- b) hypoxia, hypercarbia, acidosis, hyperkalaemia and hypothermia;
- c) myocardial stunning, caused by cardiopulmonary bypass and pre-operative myocardial damage;
- d) coronary ischaemia (coronary or conduit spasm or thrombosis);
- e) mechanical causes, such as incomplete valve repair, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve and valve thrombosis.

### • Reduced afterload, caused by:

- a) rewarming;
- b) vasoplegia, secondary to cardiopulmonary bypass-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS);
- c) protamine;
- d) blood products;
- e) glyceryl trinitrate and sodium nitroprusside;
- f) sepsis;
- g) anaphylaxis.
- Excessive afterload, caused by hypothermia, acidosis, pressors and pain can also cause low cardiac output by increasing the workload of the heart.
- The most serious causes of low cardiac output in the immediate postoperative period include massive bleeding, tamponade and myocardial ischaemia. The treatment of all three causes may require returning to the operating theatre immediately.
- It is also important to consider pre-operative (recent myocardial infarction, pulmonary hypertension) and intra-operative causes (poor myocardial protection, residual valvular regurgitation and incomplete de-airing) that may be contributing to postoperative low cardiac output syndrome.

### 10 **What are the principles in managing low cardiac output syndrome?**

- The ideal goal in managing low cardiac output syndrome is to identify and treat the underlying aetiology and achieve a cardiac index >2.5L/min/m2.
- If cardiac output monitoring is not available, the following can be used as markers of adequate organ perfusion:
  - a) mean arterial blood pressure >70mmHg;
  - b) urine output >1mL/kg/hr;
  - c) skin temperature >36.5°C;
  - d) base excess >-2mmol/L.

#### • Optimise preload:

a) fluid resuscitation to achieve right and left atrial filling pressures of 10-14mmHg. Some patients require high filling pressures, such as those with left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension and tricuspid regurgitation;

- b) urgently treat tension pneumothorax and cardiac tamponade with needle thoracocentesis and re-sternotomy, respectively;
- c) anti-arrhythmics and electrical cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm and aid rate control in the presence of tachyarrhythmias.
- Optimise myocardial contractility:
  - a) treat acidosis, hypoxia, hypercarbia and hyperkalaemia;
  - b) support the myocardium with positive inotropic agents such as epinephrine, dopamine and milrinone;
  - c) coronary vasodilators such as glyceryl trinitrate, may be required for coronary artery or arterial conduit spasm;
  - d) reoperation for occluded coronary artery bypass grafts or severe valvular regurgitation may be necessary.
- Optimise afterload with vasodilators (glyceryl trinitrate, sodium nitroprusside) or vasoconstrictors (noradrenaline, vasopressin) depending on the underlying aetiology.
- Increase the heart rate if the patient has bradycardia or heart block, using the epicardial pacing leads placed at surgery.
- Intra-aortic balloon pumps should also be considered as an efficient method of improving myocardial oxygen supply without increasing myocardial oxygen consumption.
- In certain situations, left ventricular assist devices are required to support the heart until the myocardium recovers.

#### 11 **What are the causes of right ventricular failure following cardiac surgery?**

- Right ventricular dysfunction, caused by:
  - a) poor myocardial protection during cardiopulmonary bypass;
  - b) right ventricular stunning following ischaemia reperfusion injury;
  - c) ischaemia, secondary to right coronary artery disease or a graft problem;
  - d) pre-operative right ventricular dysfunction.
- Pulmonary hypertension, secondary to:
  - a) left heart disease, such as severe mitral regurgitation or left ventricular failure;
  - b) pulmonary disease;
  - c) pulmonary embolism;
  - d) adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

### 12 **What are the principles of management of patients with right ventricular failure post-cardiac surgery?**

- Optimise right ventricular preload:
  - a) volume;
  - b) atrioventricular sequential pacing;
  - c) restore sinus rhythm, if possible.
- Optimise right ventricular contractility:
  - a) epinephrine;
  - b) phosphodiesterase inhibitor, such as milrinone.
- Optimise right ventricular afterload:
  - a) correct hypoxia, hypercarbia and acidosis, which cause pulmonary vasoconstriction;
  - b) phosphodiesterase inhibitor, such as sildenafil or milrinone;
  - c) inhaled nitric oxide (20-40 parts per million);
  - d) nesiritide (recombinant brain natriuretic peptide);
  - e) right ventricular assist device.

### 13 **What are the indications for an intra-aortic balloon pump in the peri-operative period with regards to cardiac surgery?**

- Elective in patients with significantly impaired pre-operative cardiac function.
- Peri-operative ischaemia.
- Unloading of the left ventricle following a mechanical complication of myocardial infarction, such as a ventricular septal rupture or acute myocardial regurgitation.
- Low cardiac output syndrome, unresponsive to inotropic support.
- Acute myocardial deterioration, as a bridge to revascularization, left ventricular assist device or transplantation.
- Contra-indications to intra-aortic balloon pump insertion include the presence of:
  - a) aortic regurgitation;
  - b) aortic dissection;
  - c) severe peripheral atherosclerosis.

#### 14 Describe the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology / British Pacing and Electrophysiology Group (NASPE/BPEG) five-position pacemaker classification system

- I: chamber paced O (none), A (atrium), V (ventricle), D (dual A+V),
  S (single A or V).
- II: chamber sensed O (none), A (atrium), V (ventricle), D (dual A+V), S (single A or V).
- III: response to sensing O (none), T (triggered), I (inhibited), D (dual).
- IV: programmability O (none), R (rate modulation).
- V: multisite pacing O (none), A (atrium), V (ventricle), D (dual A+V).

# 15 What are the typical temporary epicardial pacemaker settings following cardiac surgery?

- Rate 90 bpm.
- Atrial output 5mA.
- Atrial sensitivity 1.0mV.
- Ventricular output 5mA.
- Ventricular sensitivity 2.0mV.
- Atrioventricular delay (AVD) 150msec.
- Mode DDD (see above).

#### 16 What are the different ventilation modes available?

- Volume-preset modes:
  - a) assist control ventilation (AC), where the ventilator delivers a breath triggered by the patient's respiratory effort or at preset intervals if no breath occurs;
  - intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV), where the patient receives positive pressure ventilation at a preset tidal volume and respiratory rate;
  - c) synchronised intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV), where the patient breathes spontaneously but at preset intervals the next spontaneous breath is augmented by the ventilator to a preset tidal volume.

#### Pressure-preset modes:

 a) pressure controlled ventilation (PCV), where the peak airway pressure and inspiratory time are set at a fixed respiratory rate; b) pressure support ventilation (PS), where the patient's inspiratory effort is augmented by a selected level of inspiratory pressure. Hence, the patient sets the respiratory rate, flow rate and inspiratory time.

# 17 What are the typical ventilator settings in a patient following cardiac surgery?

- Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) or assist control (AC).
- Inspired oxygen concentration (FiO<sub>2</sub>) is initially set at 100% following transfer and is then progressively weaned to 40% whilst maintaining the PaO<sub>2</sub> >10kPa.
- Tidal volume (TV) 6-10mL/kg. Higher tidal volumes should be used with caution as they can cause over-stretching of an anastomosed internal mammary artery.
- Respiratory rate (RR) breaths/minute.
- Minute volume (= respiratory rate x tidal volume) 100-120mL/kg/min.
  If the patient develops hypercapnia, it can be treated by increasing the minute volume (by raising either the respiratory rate or the tidal volume).
- Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) 5cmH<sub>2</sub>O. This helps to reduce atelectasis. Higher levels can be used to help 'tamponade' mediastinal bleeding (up to 12cm H<sub>2</sub>O) but should be used with caution as these levels can impair venous return and ventricular function.
- I:E ratio 1:2. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a ratio of 1:3 may help to reduce the risk of air trapping.
- Peak inflation pressures <35cmH<sub>2</sub>O. Higher peak airway pressures suggest airway resistance, secondary to a mucous plug, a kinked endotracheal tube, bronchospasm or coughing.

# 18 What are the exclusion criteria for fast-tracking patients to early extubation following cardiac surgery?

- Poor left ventricular function, recent myocardial infarction or pulmonary oedema.
- Redo sternotomy (previous cardiac surgery).
- Severe respiratory dysfunction (FEV<sub>1</sub> <75% of predicted).</li>
- Severe pulmonary hypertension (systolic pulmonary artery pressure >60mmHg).
- Severe renal or hepatic insufficiency.
- Previous cerebrovascular accident.

- Problematic intubation.
- Prolonged operation or deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.
- High-dose inotropic requirement intra-operatively.
- On-going mediastinal bleeding.
- If patients are deemed appropriate for fast tracking for early extubation, shorter-acting anaesthetic agents are used, and early analgesia and rapid weaning of inotropes are employed.
- If the patient is haemodynamically stable, with good ventilation parameters and mediastinal bleeding is under control, the aim is to extubate within hours.

## 19 What are the disadvantages of prolonged ventilation?

- Cardiovascular side effects of sedatives and narcotics, necessitating increased pressor and volume requirements.
- Impaired right ventricular function from positive pressure ventilation.
- Ventilator-associated morbidity (such as pneumonia).
- Cost.

## 20 What are the disadvantages of early extubation?

- Increased work of breathing, resulting in increased myocardial oxygen demand.
- Increased pain and higher metabolism, resulting in increased cardiac work.

# 21 What are the criteria for extubation following cardiac surgery?

- Cardiac:
  - a) cardiac index >2.2L/min/m<sup>2</sup>;
  - b) mean arterial blood pressure >70mmHg;
  - c) no haemodynamically significant arrhythmias.

#### Respiratory:

- a) partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO<sub>2</sub>) >10kPa and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) >92% with an FiO<sub>2</sub> <50%;</li>
- b) PEEP <5cm H<sub>2</sub>O;
- c) respiratory rate <20 per minute;
- d) pressure support <10cm  $H_2O$ .

- Mediastinal drainage <50mL/hr with haemoglobin >8g/dL.
- Urine output >1mL/kg/hr.
- Neurological:
  - a) awake with stimulation and no residual neuromuscular blockade;
  - b) able to lift head off the bed;
  - c) able to cough and clear secretions to maintain own airway.
- Core temperature >36°C.
- Once the sedation has been stopped, the patient's ventilator settings are maintained with an FiO<sub>2</sub> at 50% and PEEP of 5mmHg, and the IMV rate is reduced by two breaths every 30 minutes checking arterial blood gases and then removing the endotracheal tube if the patient maintains cardiorespiratory stability. Alternatively, a trial of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with the endotracheal tube *in situ* is performed to assess whether the patient is able to self-ventilate.
- Poor prognostic factors for weaning include:
  - a) tidal volume <5mL/kg;
  - b) minute volume <10L/min;
  - c) maximum inspiratory pressure <-20cm H<sub>2</sub>O;
  - d) shallow breathing index (respiratory rate/tidal volume) >100.

# 22 What are the common causes of hypoxia and respiratory impairment in the immediate postoperative period?

- Poor gas exchange:
  - a) atelectasis, caused by:
    - i) general anaesthesia;
    - ii) compression of the lung during left internal mammary artery harvesting;
    - iii) reduced surfactant production during cardiopulmonary bypass;
    - iv) inadequate lung expansion following extubation due to pain;
    - v) retained secretions or sputum plug, associated with pre-operative smoking or pneumonia;

- b) pulmonary oedema, caused by:
  - i) left ventricular dysfunction;
  - ii) systemic inflammatory response caused by cardiopulmonary bypass;
  - iii) massive transfusion of blood products;
- c) pleural effusion, secondary to:
  - i) heart failure;
  - ii) undrained postoperative blood;
- d) bronchospasm secondary to:
  - i) pre-operative asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD);
  - ii) medications, such as b-blockers;
  - iii) anaphylaxis;
- e) pneumothorax;
- f) diaphragmatic dysfunction, secondary to phrenic nerve injury caused by:
  - i) iced cold slush;
  - ii) direct trauma to the phrenic nerve during pericardiectomy or pericardial window formation;
  - iii) injury during harvesting of the internal mammary artery.
- Inadequate oxygen delivery:
  - a) low inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2);
  - b) inadequate ventilator settings, such as low PEEP or ventilator malfunction;
  - c) misplaced endotracheal tube;
  - d) low cardiac output syndrome;
  - e) anaemia;
  - f) increased oxygen demand with shivering or sepsis.

#### 23 **What are the principles of management of patients with respiratory impairment post-cardiac surgery?**

- Assessment to identify underlying cause:
  - a) respiratory examination inspect, palpate, percuss and auscultate;
  - b) arterial blood gases pH, PaO2, PaCO2, base deficit;
  - c) chest radiograph lung pathology, endotracheal tube placement;
  - d) ventilator settings FiO2, PEEP, RR, TV, pressure support, peak airway pressures.

#### Treatment for specific aetiology:

- a) atelectasis:
  - i) chest physiotherapy:
  - ii) CPAP or increase PEEP;
  - iii) antibiotics;
  - iv) bronchoscopic clearance of secretions and plugs;
- b) pulmonary oedema:
  - i) diuresis for cardiogenic aetiology;
  - ii) for non-cardiogenic aetiology, use an adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) protocol with low tidal volumes to reduce the risk of barotrauma. Prone ventilation and nitric oxide may also be needed:
- c) pleural effusion thoracocentesis or chest drain;
- d) bronchospasm nebulisers ( $\beta$ -agonists and ipratropium bromide);
- e) pneumothorax chest drain;
- f) phrenic nerve injury supportive care with chest physiotherapy or diaphragmatic plication in severe cases;
- g) inadequate oxygen delivery or ventilation:
  - i) increase FiO<sub>2</sub> or PEEP for a low PaO<sub>2</sub>;
  - ii) increase RR or TV for a low PaCO<sub>2</sub>;
  - iii) manual ventilation for ventilator malfunction;
  - iv) reposition endotracheal tube (ideally 2cm above the carina);
  - v) low cardiac output syndrome optimise preload, contractility and afterload;
  - vi) anaemia give blood if haemoglobin is <8g/dL.

# 24 What are the criteria that suggest a diagnosis of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)?

- Acute onset of severe hypoxia refractory to oxygen therapy, with a PaO<sub>2</sub>: FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio of <200mmHg.</li>
- Bilateral infiltrates on the chest radiograph.
- Absence of cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure <18mmHg).</li>
- Reduced pulmonary compliance.
- Predisposing aetiology such as cardiopulmonary bypass, sepsis, aspiration, trauma and fat embolism.

### 25 **What are the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass on postoperative fluid balance?**

- Excess fluid in the interstitial space secondary to:
  - a) increased capillary permeability caused by systemic inflammatory response;
  - b) vasodilation, caused by rewarming;
  - c) reduced intravascular oncotic pressure, caused by haemodilution of plasma proteins and increased capillary leak.
- Increased total body fluid secondary to:
  - a) cardiopulmonary bypass prime volume (1.5-2.0L);
  - b) activation of the renin-angiotensin system, resulting in water retention;
  - c) anti-diuretic hormone production, stimulated by intravascular hypovolaemia (excess fluid in the interstitial space), resulting in water retention;
  - d) stress response producing cortisol, resulting in sodium and water retention.

### 26 **What are the risk factors for renal impairment in the immediate postoperative period?**

- Pre-operative risk factors:
  - a) pre-operative creatinine >150mmol/L;
  - b) increasing age;
  - c) left ventricular dysfunction;
  - d) emergency operations;
  - e) low cardiac output states (post-MI or mechanical complications of MI);
  - f) hypertension;
  - g) diabetes mellitus;
  - h) renal artery disease;
  - i) sepsis;
  - j) pre-operative nephrotoxins, such as contrast dye, gentamicin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

- Intra-operative risk factors:
  - a) prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time;
  - b) periods of systemic hypoperfusion or circulatory arrest;
  - c) aprotinin therapy.
- Postoperative risk factors:
  - a) acute tubular necrosis caused by hypovolaemia or low cardiac output syndrome;
  - b) excessive vasoconstriction;
  - c) sepsis;
  - d) nephrotoxins (as above).
- Normal values of renal function vary depending on the laboratory:
  - a) serum creatinine 60-120mmol/L;
  - b) serum urea 3.5-6.5mmol/L;
  - c) creatinine clearance 90-140mL/min;
  - d) glomerular filtration rate 90-140mL/min.
- Creatinine clearance can be measured with 24-hour urine collection or estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula:
  - a) actual creatinine clearance = UCr x Uvol PCr x 24 x 60
  - b) estimated creatinine clearance for men

$$= \frac{\text{(140-age) x wt in kg}}{72 \text{ x P}_{\text{Cr}}}$$

c) estimated creatinine clearance for women

$$= \frac{0.85 \text{ x (140-age) x wt in kg}}{72 \text{ x P}_{Cr}}$$

where UCr = urinary creatinine concentration, Uvol = urine volume over 24 hours, PCr = plasma creatinine (in mg/dL).

### 27 **What are the principles of managing established renal failure in the immediate postoperative period?**

- Identify and treat the underlying cause, if feasible (consider a renal ultrasound).
- Optimise the patient's haemodynamic status, especially to restore the pre-operative mean arterial pressure.

- Monitor daily weights and fluid balance.
- Monitor electrolytes, acid-base status and glucose levels.
- Eliminate nephrotoxic drugs.
- Adjust drugs that are excreted by the kidney, such as digoxin and antibiotics.
- Consider removing the urinary catheter if the patient is anuric.
- Renal replacement therapy to treat hyperkalaemia, acidosis, volume overload or uraemia.

## 28 What are the principles of renal replacement therapy?

- There are two common techniques used in patients after cardiac surgery:
  - a) haemodialysis. Blood and crystalloid fluid flow on either side of a semi-permeable membrane, thereby allowing solutes to be removed by diffusion, with molecules moving from a higher to a lower concentration. Larger molecules are not efficiently removed as smaller molecules move faster. Fluid in the dialysis compartment moves in a counter-current direction, thereby maintaining a concentration gradient;
  - haemofiltration. Water is pushed across a filter by a pressure gradient and carries dissolved solutes with it (solute drag).
     Larger molecules (up to 20,000MW) are removed at a similar rate.
- Both require double-lumen central venous access.
- Although arteriovenous renal replacement therapy is also possible, it is rarely performed in patients with a low cardiac output state as it is dependent on arterial pressure.
- As circulating inflammatory mediators are also removed from the plasma, the patient may not exhibit a pyrexial reaction in the presence of sepsis.
- Although renal replacement therapy can be performed without anticoagulation, heparin is usually used to reduce the risk of the filter or membrane clotting.
- In patients with hypotension, renal replacement therapy may not be possible because of large fluid shifts.

# 29 What are the causes of hypothermia during cardiac surgery?

- Peripheral vasodilation, caused by anaesthetic agents.
- Reduced metabolic heat production.

- Increased heat loss.
- Thermoregulatory threshold lowered by 3-4°C during general anaesthesia.
- Neuromuscular blocking drugs prevent shivering.
- Cooling effect of cold anaesthetic gases.
- Cooling effect of cold intravenous fluid infusion.
- Active cooling on cardiopulmonary bypass using a heat exchanger.

# 30 What are the effects of hypothermia in the immediate postoperative period following cardiac surgery?

- Vasoconstriction, causing increased cardiac afterload and therefore myocardial oxygen consumption.
- Increased risk of arrhythmias.
- Coagulopathy.
- Left shift of the oxygen dissociation curve, thereby impairing tissue oxygen delivery.
