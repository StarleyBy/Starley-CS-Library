### Myocardial protection

#### 1 **What are the principles of myocardial protection during cardiac surgery?**

- Using cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamping of the aorta, the coronary arteries are deprived of oxygenated blood. During this ischaemic time, damage to the myocardium needs to be minimised, hence the concept of myocardial protection.
- Several different methods of myocardial protection can be used to reduce myocardial O2 demands:
  - a) unloading the heart (cardiopulmonary bypass);
  - b) stopping the heart (cardioplegic diastolic arrest);
  - c) cooling the heart (hypothermia).
- By arresting the heart, O2 demands are reduced by 90% (Table 1; Figure 1).

#### **Table 1. Cardiac metabolic demands.**

#### **Cardiac metabolic demands**

Beating loaded heart 10ml O2 per 100mg myocardium per minute Unloaded heart 6ml O2 per 100mg myocardium per minute

(cardiopulmonary bypass)

Arrested heart 1ml O2 per 100mg myocardium per minute

(cardioplegia)

• Hypothermia further reduces the myocardial oxygen consumption and metabolic rate by a factor of 7% for every 1°C decrease in temperature.

• Using 'off-pump' coronary artery bypass surgery removes the ischaemic insult of aortic cross-clamping but has ischaemic issues of its own (see below).

**Figure 1. Myocardial oxygen demand (mVO2) at different states of ventricular work. The graph demonstrates a significant reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption in the arrested heart and additionally with hypothermia.** 

#### 2 **What are the effects of cooling on the myocardium?**

- Cooling the heart results in:
  - a) decreased metabolic rate;
  - b) decreased enzyme function;
  - c) decreased membrane stability;

- d) increased calcium sequestration;
- e) increased glucose utilization;
- f) decreased ATP generation;
- g) decreased tissue oxygen uptake;
- h) decreased osmotic homeostasis;
- i) increased hyperviscosity with rouleaux formation.
- The reduction in myocardial metabolism attributable to hypothermia is much less compared to that caused by diastolic arrest.

#### 3 What is ischaemia-reperfusion injury?

- Ischaemia-reperfusion injury represents damage to tissues following restoration of blood supply after a period of ischaemia.
- The reperfusion triggers an inflammatory response inducing tissue damage secondary to oxygen-free radicals, calcium influx, leucocytes, lactate accumulation and high-energy phosphate depletion.
- Oxygen-free radicals cause tissue damage by inducing interstitial and intracellular oedema, endothelial injury and increased microvascular permeability.
- Ischaemia-reperfusion injury of the heart may result in cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial stunning and myocyte cell death.

### 4 What are the options for myocardial protection during cardiac surgery?

- Cardioplegic arrest.
- Aortic cross-clamping with electrically-induced fibrillation.
- Hypothermic arrest with fibrillation (where the aorta remains unclamped).
- 'Off-pump' coronary artery surgery.
- Pre-operative and peri-operative measures to optimize the balance between the myocardial oxygen supply and demand are also important, including:
  - a) administering supplemental oxygen;
  - b) minimizing tachycardia (beta blockers) and hypotension;
  - c) when indicated, using an intra-aortic balloon pump;
  - d) giving pre-operative nitrates.

#### 5 **What are the different routes for delivering cardioplegia?**

• Antegrade cardioplegia delivered via the aortic root (standard method) proximal to the aortic cross-clamp at a pressure of 60- 100mmHg at 250mL/min usually results in arrest within 30-60s. Delivery may be unpredictable due to coronary artery disease and should not be used in the presence of severe aortic regurgitation, to avoid ventricular damage by mechanical dilation (Figure 2).

**Figure 2. Antegrade cardioplegia delivered via a cannula placed in the ascending aorta. RA = right atrium.**

• Antegrade cardioplegia delivered directly into the coronary ostia, such as during aortic valve and root procedures (Figure 3).

**Figure 3. Antegrade cardioplegia delivered directly into the coronary ostia. The aortic root has been excised, aortic valve exposed and coronary ostia mobilized as buttons. PA = pulmonary artery.**

- Retrograde cardioplegia delivered via the coronary sinus at a pressure of 30-50mmHg at 150mL/min usually results in arrest over minutes (Figure 4).
- An alternative method of delivering retrograde cardioplegia is independent cannulation of the SVC and IVC, which are then isolated with tapes. Cardioplegia is then delivered directly into the right atrium. This is a useful technique when these cannulae are already in position during mitral surgery. It also ensures that cardioplegia is delivered via both the Thebesian veins and coronary sinus, and avoids the pitfalls of incorrect cannula position within the coronary sinus and/or variations in coronary venous anatomy.

**Figure 4. Retrograde cardioplegia. RA = right atrium.**

• Cardioplegia is delivered through a separate roller pump with a bubble trap and microfilter.

#### 6 **How is a retrograde cardioplegia cannula inserted?**

- A 1cm2 purse-string is placed ~4cm inferior to the right atrial appendage.
- Following institution of cardiopulmonary bypass, the right atrium is filled with blood (via the bypass machine) to avoid entrapment of air.
- The tip of the retrograde cardioplegia cannula is curved to 120° and passed over the inferior vena cava cannula.
- The left hand of the operating surgeon is used to guide the retrograde cannula past the Thebesian valve into the coronary sinus within the atrioventricular groove.
- The position of the retrograde cannula can be checked by:
  - a) palpation of the cannula within the coronary sinus;

- b) manometry with the coronary sinus pressure ~20-30mmHg;
- c) aspirating dark venous blood (as the myocardium has a high oxygen uptake).
- Complications include malposition and rupture or tearing of the coronary sinus.

#### 7 **What are the advantages and disadvantages of using retrograde cardioplegia?**

- Advantages:
  - a) it is useful in patients with severe aortic regurgitation, significant coronary arterial occlusive disease or severe coronary ostial stenosis;
  - b) retrograde cardioplegia can also be given without interrupting the flow of the operation.

#### • Disadvantages:

- a) it has less predictable distribution than antegrade cardioplegia;
- b) there are concerns regarding protection of the right ventricle when using retrograde cardioplegia alone.

#### 8 **What are the different cardioplegia solutions available?**

- Crystalloid cardioplegia, usually given cold (4-10°C).
- Blood cardioplegia, which can be given hypothermic or normothermic.
- Although crystalloid and blood cardioplegia have equal efficacy in patients with normal ventricles, some studies have shown the benefit of blood cardioplegia in patients with unstable angina or left ventricular dysfunction.

#### 9 **How does cardioplegia cause cardiac arrest?**

- Cardioplegic solutions induce diastolic arrest by altering the resting potential (-90mV) and ionic gradients (Na, K, Ca, Cl) in the myocyte with two main mechanisms of action:
  - a) extracellular solutions (such as St. Thomas' solution), which prevent cardiomyocyte repolarisation by increasing the potassium concentration in the extracellular fluid;

b) intracellular solutions (such as Bredtschneider's solution), which block depolarisation by lowering extracellular sodium concentrations.

#### 10 **What are the main components of cardioplegia solution?**

- Crystalloid cardioplegia (St. Thomas' solution) contains:
  - a) sodium 110mmol/L;
  - b) potassium 16mmol/L;
  - c) calcium 1.2mmol/L;
  - d) magnesium 16mmol/L;
  - e) chloride 160mmol/L.
- Blood cardioplegia contains blood and St. Thomas' solution at a ratio of 4:1, procaine (membrane stabilizer), glutamate, aspartate, oxygenfree radical scavengers and adenosine.
- Magnesium blocks phosphorylase activity of myosin, delays calcium flux and inhibits excitation-contraction coupling.

#### 11 **What are the advantages of blood cardioplegia over crystalloid cardioplegia?**

- Blood:
  - a) provides oxygen and nutrients;
  - b) provides a buffering capacity;
  - c) minimises intracellular oedema due to its oncotic proteins;
  - d) distributes cardioplegia more evenly thereby inducing a faster onset of arrest;
  - e) scavenges oxygen-free radicals as it contains superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione and vitamins C and E.

#### 12 **What are the principles of terminal warm blood cardioplegia ('hot-shot')?**

- A 'hot shot' represents a dose of warm cardioplegia given immediately before removing the aortic cross-clamp.
- Warm cardioplegia:
  - a) allows washout of the products of anaerobic metabolism, such as lactic acid;

- b) provides substrate resuscitation of ischaemic myocytes with oxygen and ATP.
- It has been shown to improve myocardial metabolism and contractility once ventricular contractions resume.

# 13 What myocardial protection strategies are available for patients undergoing redo cardiac surgery with a patent left internal mammary artery (LIMA)?

- LIMA balloon (positioned pre-operatively under fluoroscopic guidance), which can be occluded when giving cardioplegia.
- Dissect out the LIMA and temporarily occlude when giving cardioplegia.
- Moderate hypothermic fibrillatory arrest (without occluding the LIMA).
- Cooling (28°C) with either continuous retrograde cardioplegia or intermittent antegrade cold blood cardioplegia without isolation of the LIMA.

### 14 What is the sequence of events when using the cross-clamp fibrillation technique?

- Establish cardiopulmonary bypass with mild hypothermia (32-34°C).
- Decompress the left ventricle.
- Induce ventricular fibrillation using an electric fibrillator.
- Apply the aortic cross-clamp during minimal flow on cardiopulmonary bypass.
- Perform the distal anastomosis.
- Remove the aortic cross-clamp.
- DC cardiovert into sinus rhythm (if necessary).
- Perform the proximal anastomosis.
- Repeat the sequence with the next distal anastomosis.

#### 15 What are the principles of cross-clamp fibrillation?

- The heart is electrically fibrillated prior to aortic cross-clamping thereby inducing global ischaemia with fibrillation followed by anoxic arrest.
- Some degree of myocardial protection is afforded by unloading the heart (cardiopulmonary bypass), reducing myocardial work (fibrillation) and ischaemic pre-conditioning (see below).
- The left ventricle is decompressed before placing the aortic crossclamp in order to prevent myocardial distension, subendocardial ischaemia and myofibrillar disruption.

- Mild hypothermia (32-34°C) increases permissible global ischaemia to approximately 15 minutes and dampens the amplitude of the fibrillation.
- Lower temperatures, however, cannot be used as it is difficult to defibrillate below 30°C.

### 16 What are the advantages and disadvantages of cross-clamp fibrillation?

- Advantages: simple, inexpensive, shorter aortic cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass times, and facilitates identification and differentiation of coronary arteries from veins.
- Disadvantages: aortic trauma and thrombo-embolism from repeated aortic cross-clamping (especially in arteriopaths).
- Several prospective trials have shown the efficacy of cross-clamp fibrillation is similar to cold blood cardioplegia as regards postoperative enzyme release and left ventricular function.

#### 17 What is ischaemic pre-conditioning?

- Repeated brief insults of sub-lethal ischaemia followed by reperfusion protects the myocardium during subsequent prolonged episodes of ischaemia by preserving myocardial ATP, thereby resulting in improved recovery of contractile function after reperfusion.
- The 'first window' of improved recovery immediately follows the ischaemic insult and lasts about 12 hours, with the 'second window' of recovery occurring hours after the ischaemic insult.
- Ischaemic pre-conditioning occurs through adenosine receptors.
- The cross-clamp fibrillation technique with sequential graft construction allows gradually increased areas of myocardium to be reperfused, using ischaemic pre-conditioning.

## 18 What techniques are available for myocardial protection during 'off-pump' coronary artery bypass surgery?

- Intracoronary shunts.
- Ischaemic pre-conditioning.
- Constructing the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery anastomosis as the first graft.
