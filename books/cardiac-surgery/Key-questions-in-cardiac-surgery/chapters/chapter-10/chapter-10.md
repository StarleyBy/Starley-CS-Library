## 3 **What are the effects of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest on cerebral metabolism?**

- At 20°C cerebral metabolism and oxygen consumption are approximately 20% of normothermic levels as they drop by 5% per 1°C.
- As cerebral metabolism is reduced with hypothermia, haematocrit levels can be reduced to prevent sludging of capillary beds and as reduced oxygen carrying capacity is required.
- Mortality and adverse neurologic outcomes increase after minutes of circulatory arrest at 16°C.

### 4 **What are the methods of monitoring cerebral metabolism during circulatory arrest?**

- As there are no easily available direct methods of monitoring cerebral metabolism clinically, indirect methods include:
  - a) nasopharyngeal temperature;
  - b) internal jugular venous saturation >95% signifies minimal cerebral O2 extraction and minimal cerebral activity;
  - c) electroencephalogram (EEG), although it is not always reliable to use silent EEG activity as a marker of reduced cerebral activity;
  - d) near infrared spectroscopy, which indirectly measures cerebral tissue oxygenation. There are two methods currently available,

including INVOS®, which measures changes from baseline and Foresight®, which provides the absolute value for cerebral saturation.

## 5 **What are the complications of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest?**

- Coagulopathy and platelet dysfunction.
- Systemic inflammatory response to both cardiopulmonary bypass and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest resulting in capillary leak, tissue oedema and organ dysfunction.
- Neurological injury secondary to ischaemia in watershed areas, particulate and gaseous embolism, and systemic inflammatory response.

### 6 **What is the sequence of events for deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) for surgery on the thoracic aorta?**

- Using cardiopulmonary bypass, the patient's core (nasopharyngeal) temperature is cooled to the desired lower temperature (15-18°C), using adjuncts (see below).
- To produce a steady state of hypothermia, it is important to keep the temperature at 15-18°C for minutes before the induction of DHCA. This ensures adequate suppression of cerebral activity and reduces the risk of cerebral rewarming occurring during the circulatory arrest time.
- The arterial line is then clamped, the circulating volume drained into the venous reservoir and the pump switched off.
- After completion of the operative procedure, the patient is placed in a deep Trendelenburg position.
- The circulation is then restarted at a slow rate (~500mL/min) in an antegrade direction, using the side arm of the ascending aortic interposition graft if appropriate.
- De-airing can also be facilitated by retrograde cerebral perfusion to flush out particulate and gaseous debris through the anastomotic line as well as using an aortic root vent.
- After cardiopulmonary bypass is re-established, a period of cold reperfusion for approximately 10 minutes is maintained at 15-18°C before steady active rewarming (0.2-0.5°C/min).
- It is important to avoid cerebral hyperthermia or aggressive rewarming, which may result in neurological injury during reperfusion.

### 7 **What adjuncts are used to minimise cerebral injury during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest?**

- Ice packs around the head to ensure uniform cooling and prevent rewarming during the circulatory arrest period.
- Pharmacological methods to reduce cerebral oedema include 100mg dexamethasone and 1mg/kg mannitol, but their efficacy is still debated.
- Thiopentone is often not used as the large doses required to suppress cerebral metabolism have negative inotropic side effects.
- Antegrade or retrograde cerebral perfusion (see below).
- Normoglycaemia, as hyperglycaemia can contribute to brain injury.

## 8 **How is antegrade cerebral perfusion performed?**

- A typical set-up would involve (Figure 1):
  - a) cannulating the right axillary artery (using an 18Fr cannula) either directly or indirectly with an 8mm Gortex graft attached to the artery;
  - b) clamping the brachiocephalic artery at its origin to ensure antegrade flow from the right axillary artery into the right common carotid artery and cerebral circulation;
  - c) clamping the left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery.
- Alternatively, the brachiocephalic artery and left common carotid artery can be cannulated directly from the arch using 18Fr and 14Fr cannulae, respectively, with the left subclavian artery snared without a cannula.
- The circulation is then perfused with:
  - a) cold blood between 10-18°C;
  - b) a flow rate of 10mL/kg/min (i.e. 700-900mL/min);
  - c) perfusion pressures restricted to 30-70mm Hg.
- If the perfusion pressures are too high, there is a risk of dislodging atheromatous emboli, causing air embolism or developing cerebral oedema.
- A complete Circle of Willis is important to ensure total cerebral perfusion.
- The extent to which safe deep hypothermic circulatory arrest times may be potentially extended with antegrade cerebral perfusion remains unestablished.

## 9 **How is retrograde cerebral perfusion performed?**

- A typical set-up would involve (Figure 2):
  - a) cannulating the superior vena cava (24Fr cannula) attached to the arterial line via a Y-connector with the downstream limb of the arterial line clamped;
  - b) a snare placed around the superior vena cava cannula superior to the origin of the azygos vein to reduce run-off.

**Figure 2. Retrograde cerebral perfusion. RPA = right pulmonary artery; RA = right atrium.**

- The circulation is then perfused with:
  - a) cold blood between 10-18°C;
  - b) a flow rate of 250-400mL/min;
  - c) perfusion pressures restricted to 25-40mm Hg.
- Historically, retrograde cerebral perfusion was developed to manage massive air embolism.
- The effectiveness of retrograde cerebral perfusion in protecting the brain is not clear but it may enhance cerebral cooling and wash out particulate and gaseous emboli from the cerebral circulation. During retrograde cerebral perfusion, however, dark de-oxygenated blood usually returns into the aortic arch, indicating cerebral oxygen uptake may be taking place.

#### 10 **What strategies exist in the management of acid-base metabolism during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest?**

- As the temperature decreases, there is increased solubility of a given gas (Boyles' law) resulting in more CO2 in solution but less in gaseous form, thereby producing a reduced PaCO2 and an increased pH (i.e. more alkalotic).
- During hypothermia, there are two methodologies to maintain acidbase homeostasis:
  - a) pH-stat adding CO2 to keep the PaCO2 at 5kPa and pH at 7.4, which are normal levels in arterial blood at 37°C;
  - b) alpha-stat not adding CO2, thereby allowing the pH and PaCO2 to drift as dictated by the solubility at a given temperature, producing alkalotic blood during the cooling process.
- One strategy is to use:
  - a) pH-stat on cooling; this enhances cerebral perfusion by maintaining PaCO2 and facilitates cooling;
  - b) alpha-stat on re-warming to reduce the micro-embolic load on the cerebral circulation.

## 11 **What are the advantages and disadvantages of alpha-stat and pH-stat methodology?**

- pH-stat methodology has the advantage of a more rapid and homogenous cooling but an increased risk of cerebral embolism.
- Alpha-stat methodology has the advantage of reducing the risk of cerebral embolism and the alkalosis produced may also be beneficial in terms of reducing cerebral and myocardial metabolism.
- Several prospective, randomised studies have shown the benefit of alpha-stat methodology by reducing the number of postoperative cerebral events.
- pH-stat methodology is often used in paediatric cardiac surgery.

## 12 How is the haematocrit managed during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest?

- As temperature decreases:
  - the metabolic rate decreases thereby reducing the oxygen requirement of the tissues;
  - b) blood viscosity increases resulting in an increased risk of sludging if the haematocrit remains >35%.
- In view of this, as the temperature decreases, the haematocrit is proportionally reduced to match the temperature in degrees centigrade, i.e. at temperatures of 20°C the haematocrit is maintained at about 20%.

## 13 What are the complications of blood transfusion?

- Historically, approximately 60% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery received blood transfusion, but this is associated with:
  - a) transmission of blood-borne pathogens HIV, hepatitis B / C;
  - b) transfusion reactions haemolytic, allergic, febrile;
  - c) cost;
  - d) increased bacterial infections;
  - e) reduced immune function.
- In view of this, it is important to avoid blood transfusion if possible with the usual triggers for blood transfusion being a haemoglobin of <8g/dL, with <10g/dL used in elderly and high-risk patients.</li>

## 14 What are the different options available for blood conservation?

- Pharmacological:
  - a) aprotinin (although concerns have been raised about its use; see below);
  - b) tranexamic acid;
  - c) epsilon-aminocaproic acid;
  - d) recombinant erythropoietin.
- Autologous pre-donation.
- Intra-operative cell salvage.
- Auto-transfusion of washed shed postoperative mediastinal fluid.

## 15 **What is the standard dosing regime for aprotinin (see Chapter 3)?**

- Standard Hammersmith regime:
  - a) loading dose 2 million units (= 280mg) IV;
  - b) pump prime 2 million units (= 280mg);
  - c) continuous infusion 0.5 million units (= 70mg) per hour.
- The dose should be adjusted with the patient's body weight and renal function (as aprotinin is excreted by the renal tubules).

## 16 **What are the clinical effects of aprotinin following cardiac surgery?**

- The IMAGE trial showed that aprotinin:
  - a) reduces postoperative mediastinal blood loss;
  - b) reduces the need for postoperative blood transfusions;
  - c) reduces the need for postoperative platelets and blood product requirements;
  - d) reduces the resternotomy for bleeding rate.

## 17 **What are the side effects of aprotinin?**

- Thrombotic risk anecdotal reports of thrombosis associated with heart surgery.
- Graft patency data from the IMAGE trial suggested that aprotinin reduces graft patency in coronary arteries with poor run-off.
- Hypersensitivity usually within 6 months of first exposure.
- Mortality data from the BART trial suggested that aprotinin used in cardiac surgical patients is associated with an increased incidence of mortality, renal impairment, heart failure and myocardial infarction. In view of this, aprotinin use has been suspended in cardiac surgical patients pending further studies.

## 18 **What are the clinical effects of tranexamic acid following cardiac surgery?**

• Tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce postoperative mediastinal blood losses, blood product transfusion and resternotomy for bleeding rate but is thought to be less effective than aprotinin.

## 19 **What is autologous pre-donation?**

- Autologous pre-donation is defined as blood venesected either several weeks pre-operatively or immediately prior to commencing cardiopulmonary bypass and then transfused postoperatively.
- Although it has been shown to reduce transfusion requirements, the fact that most cardiac surgical patients have one of the contraindications (anaemia, unstable angina, aortic stenosis, heart failure) means that it is rarely used in current cardiac surgical practice.

## 20 **What are the principles of intra-operative cell salvage?**

- All fluid (heparinised and non-heparinised) not returned to the bypass circuit can be scavenged by a cell saver system.
- The fluid is washed, filtered and centrifuged to produce concentrated red blood cells with a haemoglobin of 20g/dL or a haematocrit of 60% (Figure 3).
- The washing process eliminates platelets and plasma proteins, including clotting factors and fibrinogen degradation products.
- Several studies have shown that the use of cell salvage reduces postoperative blood transfusion requirements and is cost effective.

## 21 **What are the principles of autotransfusion of washed shed postoperative mediastinal fluid?**

- Shed blood collected via the pleural and pericardial drains postoperatively can be re-infused after processing through a cell salvage system.
- Although the washing process eliminates platelets and clotting factors, studies have shown this system to reduce postoperative transfusion requirements.
- As a minimum, 500mL of drainage is required to produce a meaningful volume after washing. It is not used after all cardiac surgical cases due to cost-effectiveness.

**Figure 3. Intra-operative cell salvage. Blood and other fluids drained from the chest cavity through the sucker are continuously flushed with normal saline and heparin. The heparinised diluted blood is collected into a reservoir and subsequently washed with non-heparinised normal saline before entering the centrifuge where red cells are differentiated and filtered to be collected into a re-infusion bag. Saline solution, plasma, platelets and leucocytes are discarded into a waste bag. The concentrated red cells can then be re-transfused into the patient.**

#### 22 **What are the techniques of blood conservation available for Jehovah's Witness patients undergoing cardiac surgery?**

- Pre-operatively:
  - a) erythropoietin;
  - b) stop all antiplatelets (aspirin, clopidogrel) and anticoagulants (warfarin, heparin) for 7 days if clinically possible.
- Intra-operatively:
  - a) pharmacological adjuncts aprotinin or tranexamic acid;
  - b) meticulous haemostasis;
  - c) continuous cell salvage circuit;
  - d) consider 'off-pump' or minimal extracorporeal circulation (MECC) with a low prime volume;
  - e) consider fibrin glue.
- Postoperatively:
  - a) autotransfusion of washed shed postoperative mediastinal fluid;
  - b) low threshold for resternotomy for bleeding.
