# Aortic valve disease

- 1 **What is the natural history of untreated aortic stenosis (AS)(Figure 1)?**
- Asymptomatic patients have a long latent period before the onset of symptoms and the majority of these patients are not at risk of sudden death.

**Figure 1. Graph demonstrating good survival whilst patients are asymptomatic, but a rapid decline in mean survival following the onset of symptoms. AVR = aortic valve replacement.**

- Following the onset of symptoms, however, patients with AS have a markedly reduced mean survival:
  - a) angina 5 years;
  - b) syncope 3 years;
  - c) dyspnoea 2 years.
- In patients with AS, sudden death is rare within 3 months of symptom onset.

# 2 **What is the pathophysiology of aortic stenosis?**

- Aortic stenosis induces a progressive pressure overload on the left ventricle. This generates increasing intra-ventricular pressures, producing an aortic transvalvular gradient, where the left ventricular systolic pressure is greater than the aortic systolic pressure.
- Left ventricular hypertrophy occurs as a compensatory mechanism in an attempt to reduce wall stress, as per Laplace's law (Figure 2):

$$WS = \frac{P \times r}{2 \times Th}$$

where WS = wall stress, P = LVEDP, r = LV cavity radius, Th = LV wall thickness.

![](_page_1_Picture_12.jpeg)

**Figure 2. Laplace's law demonstrating the inter-relationship between wall stress, radius, pressure and thickness. Th = wall thickness; P = LVEDP.**

- There is, however, a cost to these compensatory mechanisms:
  - a) reduced left ventricular compliance, as left ventricular hypertrophy produces a thick-walled non-compliant chamber which impairs the ability of the left ventricle to fill adequately under normal pressures (diastolic dysfunction). This is associated with increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressures (LVEDP), where the left ventricle is more dependent upon diastolic filling (atrial contraction), hence often decompensates with atrial fibrillation;
  - b) increased myocardial oxygen requirements to meet increased metabolic demands;
  - c) reduced coronary blood flow secondary to raised LVEDP, hence patients may experience angina even with normal coronary arteries.
- Eventually left ventricular systolic dysfunction occurs when increasing pressure overload overwhelms left ventricular contractile reserve resulting in left ventricular dilation and subsequent left ventricular failure.

## 3 **How is the severity of aortic stenosis quantified?**

• According to the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, there are three main criteria (Table 1).

|                                                                                 | Table 1. AHA guidelines for the severity of aortic stenosis. |                             |                     |  |  |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|--|--|
|                                                                                 | Mild                                                         | Moderate                    | Severe              |  |  |
| Aortic valve area (cm2)<br>Mean pressure gradient (mmHg)<br>Peak velocity (m/s) | 1.5-2.5<br>15-25<br><3.0                                     | 1.0-1.5<br>25-40<br>3.0-4.0 | <1.0<br>>40<br>>4.0 |  |  |

- Although commonly used in clinical practice, the peak aortic gradient is not included in the AHA criteria for the severity of AS, because the peak gradient varies with other clinical factors such as volume status and left ventricular function.
- Aortic valve area (AVA) can be calculated by:
  - a) planimetry using short axis aortic valve 2D echocardiography;

b) Continuity equation (Figure 3):

$$AVA = \frac{Area_{LVOT} \times VTI_{LVOT}}{VTI_{AoV}}$$

where LVOT = left ventricular outflow tract, VTI = velocity time intergral, AoV = aortic valve;

![](_page_3_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Figure 3. Continuity equation demonstrating that the total flow (area x velocity) of blood that passes through the LVOT is the same as the total flow of blood passing through the aortic valve. A1 = LVOT area; V1 = LVOT flow velocity; A2 = aortic valve area; V2 = intra-aortic flow velocity.**

c) Gorlin equation:

AVA = 
$$\frac{\text{CO}}{44.3 \text{ x HR x LVET x } \sqrt{\text{mean gradient}}}$$

where CO = cardiac output, HR = heart rate, LVET = left ventricular ejection time.

• Information regarding the degree of leaflet movement, valve morphology, underlying aetiology of AS and changes in left ventricular function and size are also important when assessing the severity of AS.

# 4 **What are the causes of aortic stenosis?**

- The commonest causes of AS worldwide are:
  - a) rheumatic fever, which produces commissural fusion with leaflet thickening and fibrosis, resulting in a triangular aortic valve orifice (Figure 4);

![](_page_4_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 4. Rheumatic aortic valve disease.** 

- b) calcific degeneration, which begins at the base of the cusps and progresses toward the leaflet edges with the commissures remaining open;
- c) bicuspid aortic valve, where the cusps are prone to earlier progressive thickening and calcification with age (Figure 5).

![](_page_4_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Figure 5. Bicuspid aortic stenosis. A) Cusps of approximately equal size and no midline raphe (Sievers type 0). B) Midline raphe caused by partial fusion of the right and left coronary cusps (Sievers type 1). NCC = non-coronary cusp; RCC = right coronary cusp; LCC = left coronary cusp.**

- In the developed world, the percentages change depending upon age:
  - a) <70 years old: bicuspid 50%, rheumatic fever 25%, calcific degeneration 18%;
  - b) >70 years old: calcific degeneration 48%, rheumatic fever 23%, bicuspid 21%.

#### 5 **Describe the pathological findings of calcific degeneration (Figure 6)**

- Masses of lipocalcification lying on the aortic side of the valve consisting of:
  - a) inflammatory cell infiltrate (macrophages, T lymphocytes);
  - b) lipids (low-density lipoprotein, lipoprotein A);
  - c) microscopic calcification;
  - d) proteins.
- The macrophages produce proteins, such as osteopontin, which cause calcification of the inflammatory mass.

**Figure 6. Calcific degeneration of the aortic valve.**

#### 6 What are the symptoms of aortic stenosis?

- Aortic stenosis is a progressive disease and, therefore, patients can remain asymptomatic for many years.
- Angina pectoris caused by increased myocardial O<sub>2</sub> demand secondary to increased left ventricular cavity pressure, left ventricular ejection time and muscle mass. Fifty percent of patients with AS also have co-existing coronary artery disease.
- Syncope or presyncope usually occurs following exertion where the cardiac output is fixed, resulting in arterial hypotension and reduced cerebral perfusion.
- Dyspnoea and congestive heart failure due to raised left ventricular end-diastolic pressure with outflow obstruction resulting in back pressure onto the lungs.

### 7 What are the signs of aortic stenosis?

- Pulsus tardus (slow-rising pulse).
- Pulsus parvus (small amplitude pulse).
- Apical impulse sustained but not displaced, reflecting prolonged left ventricular ejection.
- Single second heart sound (HS) as the A2 component is diminished due to calcification and stiffening of the aortic valve.
- Paradoxical splitting of the second HS due to prolonged left ventricular ejection with severe AS, resulting in a delayed A2 component.
- Fourth HS and pre-systolic thrust generated from atrial contraction into a hypertrophied and non-compliant left ventricle.
- Crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur caused by turbulent flow across the narrowed aortic valve. It is best heard over the ascending aorta in the right second intercostal space radiating to the carotids. The murmur begins after isovolumetric contraction (0.06s after the first HS) and ends before the second HS; therefore, the murmur of AS is not pan-systolic. In comparison, the pan-systolic murmur of mitral regurgitation begins immediately after the first HS and extends into the second HS. Late peaking of the AS murmur indicates severity rather than intensity of the murmur, which depends on the transaortic volume flow rate (e.g. low cardiac output), transmission of the murmur through the chest wall (e.g. obesity, emphysema) and orientation of the turbulent jet as well as the severity of AS.

# 8 What are the indications for valve replacement in patients with a rtic stenosis?

#### **AHA** guidelines

#### Class I:

- a) severe AS with symptoms (dyspnoea, angina, syncope);
- severe AS in a patient undergoing cardiac surgery (CABG, mitral valve, thoracic aorta);
- c) severe AS with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction [EF] <50%).

#### Class IIa:

 a) moderate AS in a patient undergoing cardiac surgery (CABG, mitral valve, thoracic aorta).

#### Class IIb:

- a) severe AS with an abnormal response to exercise (<20mmHg rise in systolic blood pressure);
- b) severe AS with rapid progression of the stenosis;
- c) extremely severe AS (mean gradient >60mmHg, peak velocity >5m/s, aortic valve area <0.6cm²);
- d) mild AS in a patient undergoing CABG and with rapid progression of the stenosis.

# When should patients undergoing CABG have an aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis?

#### **AHA** guidelines

- Class I: patients with severe AS.
- Class IIa: patients with moderate AS.
- Class IIb: patients with mild AS with moderate to severe calcification or rapid progression of the stenosis.
- It is also important to consider the degree of aortic valve calcification, leaflet movement, left ventricular function (as this may generate a low gradient due to low flow), patient's wishes, patient's age, hypercalcaemia, renal failure and risk of redo aortic valve replacement with patent coronary artery bypass grafts.

#### 10 **What is low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis and how is it managed?**

- Low-flow, low-gradient AS is defined as patients with a low ejection fraction of <40%, a mean pressure gradient of <30mmHg or peak aortic velocity of <3.5m/s and a calculated aortic valve area of <1.0cm2.
- Dobutamine stress echocardiography, where 5-20mg/kg/min of dobutamine is administered in increments of 5mg every 5 minutes, is used to distinguish:
  - a) patients with severe AS but a low gradient (~30mmHg) due to low cardiac output with poor left ventricular function, who would benefit from aortic valve replacement (AVR) (operative mortality 5%);
  - b) patients with mild or moderate AS with low flow due to primary contractile dysfunction, who would not benefit from AVR (operative mortality 32%) (Table 2).

**Table 2. Results of dobutamine stress echocardiography to distinguish severe AS from primary contractile dysfunction.**

|                                                 | Stroke | Peak pressure | Aortic valve                      |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------|---------------|-----------------------------------|
|                                                 | volume | gradient      | area                              |
| Severe AS<br>Primary contractile<br>dysfunction |        | «             | «<br>(by >0.2cm2 or to<br>1.2cm2) |

- If the stroke volume fails to rise, each case is decided on an individual patient basis.
- Information regarding the degree of leaflet calcification, valve morphology, and leaflet motion on echocardiography and fluoroscopy is also used in the decision making process.

#### 11 **How is a patient with asymptomatic aortic stenosis managed?**

• Firstly, it is important to ensure the patient does not have any symptoms by detailed questioning and then proceed to an exercise test to determine whether the patient is truly asymptomatic.

- Look for evidence of other AHA criteria for aortic valve replacement surgery:
  - a) left ventricular dysfunction;
  - b) extremely severe AS;
  - c) rapid progression of the stenosis;
  - d) if the patient is undergoing other cardiac surgery (CABG, mitral valve, thoracic aorta).
- If the patient is truly asymptomatic and there are no other criteria for surgery, the patient should be followed up with serial echocardiograms and clinic monitoring depending on the severity of the aortic stenosis:
  - a) mild every 5 years;
  - b) moderate every 3 years;
  - c) severe every year.

#### 12 **What is the natural history of patients with untreated aortic regurgitation (AR)?**

- 6% of asymptomatic patients with good left ventricular function either become symptomatic or develop left ventricular dysfunction per year.
- 25% of asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction develop symptoms per year.
- Symptomatic patients have a 10% mortality per year.

# 13 **How is aortic regurgitation quantified?**

• According to the AHA guidelines, there are five main criteria (Table 3).

|                                          | Mild | Moderate | Severe |
|------------------------------------------|------|----------|--------|
| Jet width (% LVOT diameter)              | <25  |    | >65    |
| Vena contracta (cm)                      | <0.3 | 0.3-0.6  | >0.6   |
| Regurgitant volume (mL)                  | <30  |    | >60    |
| Regurgitant fraction (%)                 | <30  |    | >50    |
| Effective regurgitant orifice area (cm2) | <0.1 | 0.1-0.3  | >0.3   |
|                                          |      |          |        |

• Additional criteria used to quantify AR, which are not in the AHA guidelines, are shown below in Table 4.

| Table 4. Additional criteria used to quantify the severity of aortic<br>regurgitation. |              |                    |              |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------|--------------|
|                                                                                        | Mild         | Moderate           | Severe       |
| Deceleration rate (m/s2)<br>Pressure half-time (ms)                                    | <2.0<br>>400 | 2.0-3.0<br>300-400 | >3.0<br><300 |

• Information regarding the aortic root and ascending aorta dimensions, valve morphology, flow reversal in the descending aorta, changes in left ventricular function and size, and other valvular lesions are also important when assessing AR.

# 14 **What are the causes of aortic regurgitation?**

- The aetiology of AR can be sub-divided according to the anatomical location of the disease process:
  - a) leaflet calcific degeneration, rheumatic fever, bicuspid aortic valve, infective endocarditis;
  - b) annulus, aortic root or ascending aorta aneurysm, dissection.
- The commonest causes of acute AR include aortic dissection, infective endocarditis and trauma.

# 15 **What are the symptoms of aortic regurgitation?**

- Aortic regurgitation is a gradually progressive disease and therefore patients can remain asymptomatic for many years.
- Dyspnoea, orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea due to raised left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, resulting in back pressure onto the lungs.
- Fatigue.
- Congestive cardiac failure and pulmonary oedema when left ventricular compensatory mechanisms are overwhelmed.

# 16 **What are the signs of aortic regurgitation?**

• A widened pulse pressure occurs due to augmentation of the total cardiac output resulting in distension of the peripheral arterial system followed by quick collapse secondary to regurgitant flow through the aortic valve. Clinically, this manifests itself through several eponymous signs:

- a) Duroziez's sign to-and-fro (systolic and diastolic) murmur audible over the femoral artery when compressed with a stethoscope;
- b) Quinke's sign pulsation in the capillary membranes of the fingertips;
- c) Traube's sign pistol-shot sound audible over the femoral artery;
- d) De Musset's sign head bobbing with a collapsing pulse;
- e) Corrigan's pulse water-hammer collapsing pulse;
- f) Mueller's sign pulsation of the uvula;
- g) Hill's sign systolic blood pressure in the leg greater than the systolic pressure in the arm by at least 20mmHg.
- Apical impulse is hyperdynamic and displaced inferolaterally.
- 3rd HS loudest at the apex with the patient lying on their left side using the bell of the stethoscope.
- Decrescendo diastolic murmur heard best at the left sternal edge with the patient sitting forward in expiration.
- Systolic flow murmur related to the ejection of a large stroke volume.
- Austin Flint low-pitched diastolic murmur occurs due to the Bernoulli effect of turbulence on the mitral valve. It is best heard at the apex of the heart with the patient lying on their left side using the bell of the stethoscope.

#### 17 **What are the indications for valve replacement in patients with aortic regurgitation?**

#### *AHA guidelines*

#### • Class I:

- a) severe AR with symptoms (dyspnoea);
- b) severe AR in patients undergoing cardiac surgery (CABG, mitral valve, thoracic aorta);
- c) severe AR with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF <50%).

#### • Class IIa:

a) severe AR with left ventricular dilation (end-systolic diameter >55mm and end-diastolic diameter >75mm);

#### • Class IIb:

- a) severe AR with an abnormal response to exercise (<20mmHg rise in systolic blood pressure);
- b) severe AR with rapid progression of the regurgitation;
- c) severe AR with left ventricular dilation (end-systolic diameter >50mm and end-diastolic diameter >70mm);
- d) moderate AR in patients undergoing cardiac surgery (CABG, mitral valve, thoracic aorta).

#### 18 **How is a patient with asymptomatic aortic regurgitation managed?**

- Firstly, it is important to ensure the patient does not have any symptoms by detailed questioning and then proceed to an exercise test to determine whether the patient is truly asymptomatic.
- Look for evidence of other AHA criteria for aortic valve replacement surgery:
  - a) left ventricular dysfunction;
  - b) rapid progression of the regurgitation;
  - c) if the patient is undergoing other cardiac surgery (CABG, mitral valve, thoracic aorta).
- If the patient is truly asymptomatic and there are no other criteria for surgery, the patient should be followed up with serial echocardiograms and clinic monitoring depending on the severity of the aortic regurgitation:
  - a) mild every 5 years;
  - b) moderate every 3 years;
  - c) severe every year.

#### 19 **When should patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) with coronary artery disease undergo concomitant bypass grafting?**

#### *AHA guidelines*

- Class I coronary stenosis >70%.
- Class IIa coronary stenosis between 50-70%.

#### 20 **Which patients should have aortic valve replacement on an in-hospital urgent basis rather than being placed on a routine elective waiting list?**

- Patients with pulmonary oedema and congestive cardiac failure, secondary to decompensated AS or AR.
- Patients with recurrent syncopal episodes with AS.
- Patients with symptoms, such as chest pain or dyspnoea, at rest.

#### 21 **What structures are at risk during aortic valve surgery (Figure 7)?**

- Anterior mitral valve leaflet (beneath the non-coronary and left coronary cusps).
- Membranous septum (beneath the non-coronary and right coronary cusps).
- Bundle of His (beneath the commissure between the non-coronary and right coronary cusps).
- Left and right coronary ostia.

**Figure 7. Surgical anatomy and inter-relationships of the aortic valve. RVOT = right ventricular outflow tract; RA = right atrium; LA = left atrium; RCA = right coronary artery; LMCA = left main coronary artery; AMVL = anterior mitral valve leaflet.**

# 22 What are the surgical approaches to the aortic valve?

- Oblique aortotomy (J-shaped).
- Transverse aortotomy.
- Greater curve aortotomy, which can be combined with an aortoplasty to reduce the size of a moderately enlarged ascending aorta.

# 23 What are the different methods of implanting an aortic valve prosthesis?

- Interrupted sutures technique, which is slower, but has the theoretical reduced risk of a paravalvular leak (Figure 8). It is generally used in patients with friable tissues secondary to endocarditis, often combined with pledgets:
  - everting sutures place the prosthetic valve in an intra-annular position thereby reducing the relative effective orifice area (EOA) of the annulus allowing a smaller valve to be implanted;
  - b) non-everting sutures place the prosthetic valve in a supraannular position, thereby increasing the effective orifice area of the annulus, allowing a larger valve to be implanted, relative to the everting suture technique.
- Semi-continuous technique, which is faster, but has a theoretical increased risk of a paravalvular leak. By the nature of this technique the sutures are placed using everting sutures but the valve can be positioned into a supra-annular or intra-annular position.

**Figure 8.** A) Everting and B) non-everting sutures for a ortic valve replacement.

#### 24 **What is the definition of patient prosthesis mismatch (PPM)?**

- PPM is defined as the EOA of an implanted prosthetic valve being too small relative to the patient's body surface area.
- It is sub-classified by a prosthetic valve EOAI (EOA indexed):
  - a) mild >0.85cm2/m2;
  - b) moderate 0.65-0.85cm2/m2 ;
  - c) severe <0.65cm2/m2.
- Although PPM leads to persistently high transvalvular pressure gradients, reduced left ventricular mass regression, reduced symptom improvement and reduced exercise tolerance, there is controversy regarding the effects of PPM on short and long-term mortality.

#### 25 **What surgical options are available in patients with a small aortic root?**

A small aortic root results in the inability to implant an aortic valve prosthesis suitable for the patient's size and activity. In view of this several surgical options need to be considered:

- Implanting an aortic valve prosthesis with an improved effective orifice area:
  - a) supra-annular (such as Carbomedics Top Hat®, Medtronic SAV);
  - b) improved haemodynamics (such as the St Jude Regent®);
  - c) small sewing ring (such as the CE Perimount Magna®);
  - d) stentless (such as the ElanTM bioprosthesis).
- Aortic root enlargement with a bovine pericardial patch.
- Aortic annular enlargement:
  - a) Nicks' annuloplasty (Figure 9);
  - b) Manougian's annuloplasty (Figure 10);
  - c) Konno.
- Aortic root replacement.
- Apico-aortic valved conduit (composite graft from the left ventricular apex to the descending aorta).

**Figure 10. Manougian's aortic annuloplasty with the incision passing through the commissure between the left and non-coronary sinuses.**

#### 26 **How are patients followed up after an aortic valve replacement?**

- Ideally all patients have an echocardiogram pre-discharge to look for valve function, paravalvular leak, left ventricular function, pericardial effusion and damage to nearby structures. Furthermore, it serves as a baseline for further surveillance.
- Routine postoperative follow-up comprises of a week appointment, a 6-month appointment and then annual out-patient visits.
- Mechanical valve patients do not require routine echocardiography follow-up unless the patient develops new symptoms or a murmur.
- Bioprosthesis valve patients, however, require an annual echocardiogram follow-up after 5 years to identify any evidence of structural valve deterioration.

#### 27 **What are the approximate peak aortic gradients (mmHg) through prosthetic valves (Table 5)?**

#### 29 **What were the results of the two main randomised controlled trials looking at mechanical and bioprosthetic valve replacements?**

#### *Veterans Affairs Trial*

- This trial looked at 575 men, who underwent valve replacement (384 aortic valve replacements, 181 mitral valve replacements) between, with a 15-year follow-up.
- Patients who underwent mechanical AVR (Bjork-Shiley®) had a better long-term survival than those with bioprosthetic AVR (Hancock®).
- Patients who underwent mechanical AVR had a lower re-operation at 15 years than those with bioprosthetic AVR (3% vs. 29%).
- There was no evidence of structural valve degeneration of the mechanical prostheses (Bjork-Shiley®).

- In young patients (aged less than 65 years old), structural valve deterioration occurred approximately years following bioprosthetic AVR.
- Bioprosthetic valves were associated with less bleeding but the same thrombo-embolism rates as mechanical valves.

#### *Edinburgh Heart Valve Trial*

- This trial looked at 541 men and women, who underwent valve replacement (211 aortic valve replacements, 261 mitral valve replacements) between 1975 - 1979, with a 20-year follow-up.
- There was no survival difference between patients who underwent mechanical AVR (Bjork-Shiley®) and bioprosthetic AVR (Hancock®/ Carpentier Edwards porcine).
- Re-operation rates were greater following bioprosthetic AVR than mechanical AVR.
- Thrombo-embolism and prosthetic valve endocarditis rates were the same for both valves.
- Bleeding rates were greater following mechanical AVR than bioprosthetic AVR.

#### 30 **When should allografts, autografts and stentless aortic valves be used?**

- Aortic valve homografts (allografts) are used for patients with an aortic root abscess or a small aortic root.
- Pulmonary autografts (Ross operation) are used in children but in the absence of connective tissue disorders.
- Stentless aortic valves are usually used depending on surgeon choice, as there is a perceived benefit in avoiding patient prosthesis mismatch. The long-term benefits of this, however, have not been confirmed in the three randomised controlled trials that have been conducted.

#### 31 **What is the freedom from structural valve deterioration (Figure 11) for the different aortic valve prostheses?**

- For patients greater than 70 years old, the freedom from structural valve deterioration at 15 years is:
  - a) mechanical prosthesis 97%;
  - b) aortic valve homograft 85%;
  - c) bovine pericardial valve 85%;
  - d) porcine bioprosthesis 80%;
  - e) stentless bioprosthesis 80%;
  - f) pulmonary autograft (Ross) 74% for the aortic valve, 80% for the pulmonary valve.

**Figure 11. Structural valve deterioration, demonstrated by thickening and calcification of the bovine pericardial leaflets. A) Aortic side. B) Left ventricular side.**

- Structural valve deterioration (SVD) in bioprosthetic valves is greater in the younger population due to increased haemodynamic demands. SVD at 10 years is:
  - a) 40% in patients aged years;
  - b) 30% in patients aged years;
  - c) 10% in patients aged >70 years.
- Structural valve deterioration and calcification occur at the areas of greatest stress, such as commissures and zones of flexion.

#### 32 **What is the significance of a patient with a bicuspid aortic valve?**

- It is the commonest congenital cardiac condition, occurring in 1-2% of the population, with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.
- Patients with a bicuspid aortic valve are more likely to have:
  - a) a short left main stem coronary artery;
  - b) a left dominant coronary artery circulation;
  - c) an anomalous position of the coronary ostia;
  - d) aortopathy resulting in dissection or aneurysm;
  - e) coarctation of the aorta;
  - f) earlier onset of aortic stenosis.
- Histological analysis of the aorta in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve reveals cystic medial necrosis, reduced fibrillin-1 production and elastin fragmentation.

# 33 What factors should be considered when choosing between a mechanical and bioprosthetic aortic valve (Figures 12-14)?

- Prosthesis type does not influence survival, thrombo-embolism or infective endocarditis rates.
- Bleeding is more frequent with mechanical valves.
- SVD is more common with bioprosthetic valves.
- Mechanical valves are the preferred choice if:
  - a) the patient is already on warfarin with another mechanical valve;
  - b) the patient is young (age <60) and does not want another operation.

- Bioprosthetic valves are the preferred choice if:
  - a) the patient is aged >65;

b) the patient wants to avoid warfarin (patient preference, contraindication to warfarin, woman of child-bearing age, young patient with active lifestyle, recent GI bleed, awaiting future operation for malignancy, etc).

#### 34 **What valve should be used in patients with renal failure on haemodialysis?**

- The AHA guidelines in 1998 suggested using a mechanical prosthesis; however, the AHA guidelines in 2006 made no recommendation.
- It has been suggested that most modern bioprosthetic valves will last longer than these patients with end-stage renal failure, hence by implanting a bioprosthetic valve, it is possible to avoid the use of long-term anticoagulation in these difficult cases.

#### 35 **How is a patient with a thrombosed aortic valve managed?**

#### *AHA guidelines*

- Patients with NYHA III-IV symptoms or a large thrombus burden should undergo an emergency operation.
- Patients with NYHA I-II symptoms or a small clot burden should undergo fibrinolysis.

#### 36 **What factors should be considered when choosing which aortic valve prosthesis to implant in women of child-bearing age?**

- Bioprosthetic valves degenerate quicker in younger patients and this process can be accelerated by pregnancy.
- Mechanical valves obligate the need for anticoagulation and this may cause problems with warfarin during pregnancy.
- A pulmonary autograft or aortic homograft can be used but would involve complex subsequent redo surgery.
- One strategy would be to consider a bioprosthesis until the patient has completed her family and then replace it with a mechanical valve when the bioprosthesis degenerates.

### 37 **What are the important factors to consider in a pregnant patient with a mechanical valve** *in situ***?**

- It is critical to explain the risks and benefits of all the options to the patient and her partner.
- As warfarin crosses the placenta, there is an increased risk of abortion, prematurity and stillbirth.
- Warfarin is also associated with a risk of embryopathy (in 5-10% of patients but is lower if the dose is <5mg/day). It is thought to probably be safe to use warfarin during weeks and during the second and third trimesters.
- Heparin, however, does not cross the placenta and therefore does not cause embryopathy but may induce bleeding at the uteroplacental junction.
- One strategy in the management of a pregnant patient with a mechanical valve in situ includes:
  - a) warfarin during weeks 1-6;
  - b) unfractionated heparin during weeks 6-12;
  - c) warfarin during weeks 12-36;
  - d) unfractionated heparin from week 36;
  - e) stop heparin before delivery;
  - f) restart unfractionated heparin hours post-placental separation once bleeding is controlled.

**Figure 15. A) Cardiac structures exposed following an upper hemisternotomy. B) Set-up for an aortic valve replacement through an upper hemisternotomy prior to aortotomy. RA = right atrium; RV = right ventricle; Asc Ao = ascending aorta.**

- Hemisternotomy (Figure 15) performed with a J-shaped incision from the suprasternal notch to the 4th intercostal space on the right.
- Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI):
  - a) transapical route via a small left anterior thoracotomy, which allows the aortic valve to be approached in an antegrade direction (see below);
  - b) transfemoral route via the femoral artery, which allows the aortic valve to be approached in a retrograde direction.

## 39 **Describe the steps involved in a transapical transcatheter aortic valve implantation (Figure 16)**

- General anaesthesia.
- A temporary right ventricular pacing wire is inserted via the left femoral vein.
- A pig-tail catheter is inserted into the aortic root via the right femoral artery and is used for contrast injection and pressure measurements.
- A small (approximately 5cm) left anterior thoracotomy is performed, usually made in the 6th intercostal space but echocardiography is used to locate the left ventricular apex.
- The pericardium is incised anterior to the left phrenic nerve to gain access to the left ventricular apex.
- A pledgeted 2/0 Prolene® purse string is placed at the apex of the left ventricle.
- Using a stab incision, a balloon dilator is passed through the apex and positioned across the aortic valve using fluoroscopic guidance.
- Using rapid ventricular pacing (200 bpm) to reduce cardiac output across the aortic valve, the balloon is dilated to 45 atmospheres for 5 seconds.
- The preloaded crimped stented valve is then passed through the left ventricular apex and again positioned across the aortic valve using fluoroscopic guidance.
- Again using rapid ventricular pacing (200 bpm), the balloon inside the valve is dilated to 45 atmospheres for 5 seconds.
- Transoesophageal echocardiography is used to check positioning of the implanted aortic valve prosthesis and for the presence of any paravalvular regurgitation.
