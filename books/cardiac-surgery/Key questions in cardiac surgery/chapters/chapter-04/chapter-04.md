- parts of the body with a positive deflection representing the electrical vector moving towards the positive electrode.
- The typical ECG paper speed is 25mm/sec but can be increased to 50mm/sec in order to assess the morphology of the complexes more clearly.
- The width of the small squares represents 0.04 sec and large squares 0.2 sec (at 25mm/sec).
- The height of the small squares represents 0.1mV and large squares 0.5mV.

## 5 **How is the heart rate assessed on an ECG?**

• With each small square representing 0.04 sec, the RR interval can be measured to obtain the time interval between each cardiac cycle. The heart rate can be calculated using the formula (Figure 14):

Heart rate (bpm) = 60 / RR interval

![](_page_9_Figure_9.jpeg)

RR interval = 0.36 secs HR = 60 / RR interval HR = 60 / 0.36 = 167 bpm

**Figure 14. Calculating the heart rate using the RR interval.**

• An alternative is to count the number of large squares between each R wave and then use the formula (Figure 15):

Heart rate (bpm) = 300 / number of large squares

![](_page_9_Figure_14.jpeg)

**Figure 15. Calculating the heart rate using the number of large squares method.**

## 6 **How is the cardiac axis assessed on an ECG?**

• The degree of net amplitude displacement is determined in leads I and aVF on a cardiac axis plot (Figure 16).

**Figure 16. Electrical axis calculated by plotting the net amplitude in leads I and aVF.**
