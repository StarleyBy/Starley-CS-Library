## Coronary artery disease

- 1 **What is the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease (Figure 1)?**
- Coronary artery disease is caused by atherosclerosis, which develops in three stages:
  - a) linear fatty streak focal intimal thickening caused by deposition of lipid-filled macrophages and smooth muscle cells;
  - b) fibrolipid plaques consisting of these lipid-laden cells, an inflammatory core and cholesterol deposits, encased by a fibrous cap, resulting in luminal narrowing;

**Figure 1. Development of atherosclerosis.**

- c) evolution of plaques plaque rupture and exposure of blood to the contents of a plaque can result in luminal thrombosis or a 'major plaque event'. With smaller amounts of thrombosis, luminal occlusion does not occur but subsequent embolisation of thrombi may trigger arrhythmias or plaque growth by the release of platelet-derived growth factors which stimulate smooth muscle division. Plaque rupture is more likely in soft plaques with low fibrin content than hard plaques, thus soft plaques are potentially more lethal even if they are smaller than hard plaques which have a thick fibrous cap.
- Risk factors for atherosclerosis include smoking, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, male gender, increasing age and a positive family history of ischaemic heart disease.
- Myocardial ischaemia represents an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand.
- Myocardial infarction (MI) represents ischaemia-induced cardiomyocyte loss (necrosis) and is caused by coronary artery occlusion secondary to:
  - a) progressive atherosclerosis;
  - b) disruption of an unstable plaque with acute thrombosis.

### 2 **What are the principles of treating angina pectoris?**

- Conservative cessation of smoking, healthy diet, blood pressure control, diabetic control.
- Medical antiplatelet, statin, nitrate, b-blocker, calcium channel blocker, nicorandil (see Chapter 3).
- Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) balloon angioplasty, bare metal stent, drug-eluting stent.
- Surgery coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), transmyocardial revascularisation (see below).

#### 3 **What is the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) classification?**

- It is a functional classification that relates the patient's symptoms of angina with the ability to perform activities:
  - a) I: no limitations of physical activity and no symptoms with ordinary activity;
  - b) II: slight limitation of physical activity with angina precipitated by vigorous activity;

- c) III: marked limitation of physical activity with angina precipitated by routine activity;
- d) IV: inability to perform any activities without angina or symptoms of angina at rest.

### 4 **What is acute coronary syndrome (ACS)?**

- Acute coronary syndrome represents a group of clinical conditions that are caused by acute myocardial ischaemia.
- They are grouped together as their management is similar and are only differentiated by blood tests and electrocardiographical changes:
  - a) unstable angina (UA) defined as angina:
    - i) occurring with increasing frequency and severity;
    - ii) occurring at rest or more frequently at night;
    - iii) not relieved quickly with sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN);
  - b) non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI);
  - c) ST elevation MI (STEMI).

## 5 **How are patients with UA or NSTEMI managed?**

- The main principles of managing patients with UA and NSTEMI include:
  - a) stabilisation of the atheromatous plaque;
  - b) restoration of coronary blood flow;
  - c) alleviation of the flow-limiting stenosis.

- Initial medical management of patients with acute coronary syndrome includes:
  - a) analgesia (diamorphine);
  - b) anti-anginal therapy (b-blocker, nitrate, calcium channel blocker);
  - c) dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel);
  - d) low-molecular-weight heparin;
  - e) statin.
- Within 6 months following admission with ACS, 30% of patients will be readmitted with recurrent unstable angina, myocardial infarction or death (12%). In view of this, it is important to risk stratify these patients to determine which patient should undergo coronary revascularisation prior to discharge.
- High-risk patients should receive glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, undergo urgent coronary angiography and subsequent revascularisation with PCI or CABG. High-risk factors include:
  - a) patient factors:
    - i) age >65;
    - ii) hypertension;
    - iii) diabetes mellitus;
    - iv) previous myocardial infarction;
    - v) left ventricular dysfunction;
    - vi) ongoing pain despite medical therapy;
    - vii) cardiogenic shock;
  - b) ECG changes:
    - i) transient ST elevation or depression during pain;
    - ii) persistent ST depression;
    - iii) deep T-wave inversion;
    - iv) left bundle branch block (LBBB);
    - v) ventricular tachycardia;
  - c) any elevation in cardiac enzymes.
- The remaining patients should undergo investigation with an exercise tolerance test or stress nuclear medicine scanning and if positive proceed to coronary angiography.

### 6 **How is myocardial infarction classified?**

- Size:
  - a) microscopic focal necrosis;

- b) small <10% of the left ventricle;
- c) medium 10-30% of the left ventricle;
- d) large >30% of the left ventricle.
- Location anterior, septal, inferior, lateral or posterior.
- Time from onset:
  - a) acute 6 hours to 7 days (polymorphonuclear leucocytes);
  - b) healing 7 to 28 days (mononuclear cells and fibroblasts);
  - c) healed >28 days (scar tissue without cellular infiltration).
- ST elevation:
  - a) non-ST elevation MI no transmurality;
  - b) ST elevation MI transmural.

#### 7 **What are the diagnostic features of an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)(Figure 2 and Table 2)?**

- According to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines, the criteria for acute ST elevation myocardial infarction are a typical rise and fall of cardiac enzymes (troponin or CK-MB) associated with at least one of the following:
  - a) ST elevation (>0.1mV except >0.2mV in V1-3 at the J point in two or more contiguous leads) with peaked T wave;
  - b) pathological Q waves >0.04sec or >25% of total QRS complex;
  - c) ischaemic type chest pain lasting >20 minutes.

**Table 2. Elevation of cardiac enzymes associated with acute myocardial infarction.**

**Figure 2. Cardiac enzyme elevation during acute ST elevation myocardial infarction. CK = creatinine kinase; CK-MB = creatinine kinase - muscle brain fraction.**

#### • Elevated cardiac enzymes:

- a) creatinine kinase (normal <140IU/L for women and <170IU/L for men);
- b) creatinine kinase MB (cardiac) isoenzyme (normal <3.0ng/L);
- c) troponin T (normal <0.1ng/mL);
- d) troponin I (normal <0.3ng/mL) may also be raised with renal impairment.
- LBBB can make ST elevation difficult to interpret.

### 8 **How are patients with STEMI managed?**

- The main principles of managing patients with STEMI are similar to those with UA and NSTEMI including stabilisation of atheromatous plaque, restoration of coronary blood flow and alleviation of the flowlimiting stenosis.
- Initial medical management of patients with STEMI includes:
  - a) oxygen;
  - b) analgesia (diamorphine) and anti-emetic (metoclopramide);
  - c) antiplatelet therapy (aspirin);
  - d) b-blocker;
  - e) statin.
- Nitrates, furosemide, atropine and lidocaine may be required for the complications of myocardial infarction including ongoing chest pain, pulmonary oedema, bradycardia or ventricular arrhythmia, respectively.
- Restoration of coronary blood flow is achieved by primary PCI (if available) or thrombolysis (indications include ST elevation or new onset LBBB within 12 hours of the onset of pain or within 24 hours in patients with ongoing pain).
- High-risk rescue PCI or CABG may be required for patients who have ongoing chest pain or ECG changes following thrombolysis.

risk. The Logistic EuroSCORE, which is calculated using a complex algorithm involving the same factors, is thought to be more accurate at predicting the operative mortality risk.

# 13 How would you manage a patient with a porcelain aorta requiring CABG (Figure 3)?

- No-touch technique using off-pump or hypothermic fibrillatory arrest (with femoral artery cannulation) with bilateral mammary arteries and a y-graft or sequential anastomosis, as required.
- Hybrid procedure with off-pump LIMA-LAD (left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery) anastomosis and PCI to the remaining lesions.
- PCI if the porcelain aorta is discovered pre-operatively.

**Figure 3.** Porcelain aorta. Marked calcification (arrows) of the ascending aorta makes aortic cross-clamping impossible.

# 14 Which patients should have a CABG on an in-hospital urgent basis rather than placed on a routine elective waiting list?

- NSTEMI high-risk group.
- Critical anatomy left main stem stenosis, left main equivalent with right coronary artery disease.
- Unstable angina ongoing symptoms at rest.
- Cardiac instability pulmonary oedema or ventricular arrhythmias with surgical anatomy.

# 15 How is a patient with acute post-infarct ventricular septal rupture (VSR) managed?

- According to the AHA guidelines, a patient with a post-infarction ventricular septal rupture should undergo emergency repair, with coronary artery bypass grafting at the same time.
- These patients are haemodynamically optimised without delaying surgery by using an inodilator (such as dobutamine), diuretics and placing an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). This reduces the systemic vascular resistance and the left to right shunt, thereby maintaining cardiac output and organ perfusion.
- In patients who present with cardiogenic shock and multi-organ failure, it may be prudent to optimise them with medical therapy as emergency surgery carries a very high mortality in this cohort.

# 16 What is the long-term survival of patients with post-infarct VSR?

• In patients medically treated with post-infarct VSR, the survival is shown in Table 6.

| Table 6. Long-<br>infarct VSR. | erm survival of patients with medically treate | ed post- |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------|
| 1 day<br>1 week                | 75%<br>50%                                     |          |
| 2 weeks                        | 35%                                            |          |
| 1 month<br>1 year              | 20%<br>5%                                      |          |

- In comparison, the operative mortality for these patients is 30-40%, with a 5-year survival of 75% in hospital survivors and an NYHA symptom status I-II in 80%.
- 17 What are the operative risk factors for patients undergoing surgery for post-infarct VSR?
- Cardiogenic shock.
- Left main stem stenosis.
- Right heart failure.

- Renal impairment.
- Inferior myocardial infarction.
- Increased age.

# 18 What is the operative technique for a post-infarct VSR (Figure 4)?

![](_page_16_Figure_6.jpeg)

![](_page_16_Figure_7.jpeg)

Figure 4. Surgical repair of a post-infarct ventricular septal rupture. A) Antero-septal myocardial infarction with associated ventricular septal rupture. B) Following an anterior ventriculotomy, the rupture is excluded from the left ventricular cavity using a bovine pericardial patch, which is brought out through the ventriculotomy. C) Two-layered closure of the ventriculotomy, supported by Teflon® strips. PDA = posterior descending artery; LAD = left anterior descending artery; LV = left ventricle; RV = right ventricle; IVS = interventricular septum; VSR = ventricular septal rupture.

- A left ventriculotomy is made through the infarcted anterior or inferior left ventricular wall 2-3cm parallel to the left anterior descending artery or posterior descending artery, respectively.
- A glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine pericardial patch is then sutured to healthy endocardium deep in the left ventricle, to exclude the infarct and VSR from the high-pressure area of the left ventricle.
- The ventriculotomy is closed in two layers, buttressed by Teflon® strips and biological glue.
- Using this technique left ventricular geometry and volume can be restored.

#### 19 **How is a patient with a post-infarct left ventricular false aneurysm managed?**

- Acute rupture is invariably fatal.
- In patients who present subacutely, the infarct exclusion technique (as described with post-infarct VSR repair) can be used.
- Alternatively, the left ventricle can be closed in two layers buttressed by Teflon® strips and biological glue.

#### 20 **How is a patient with post-infarct papillary muscle rupture managed?**

- Surgery is the treatment of choice. Although operative mortality is high (20-50%), it compares favourably with medical treatment (75% mortality at 24 hours and 95% at 48 hours).
- Pre-operatively, these patients are haemodynamically optimised without delaying surgery by using an inodilator (such as dobutamine), and diuretics, and placing an IABP. This reduces the systemic vascular resistance, thereby helping to maintain cardiac output and organ perfusion until surgical correction.
- Operative techniques include:
  - a) re-implantation of the papillary muscle in patients with partial rupture;
  - b) mitral valve replacement in patients with complete papillary muscle rupture.

# 21 In addition to the LIMA, what are the conduit options for patients with long saphenous varicose veins undergoing CABG?

- Right internal mammary artery.
- Left and right radial arteries.
- Sequential grafts.
- Short saphenous vein.
- Hybrid procedure with LIMA-LAD followed by PCI.

# 22 What is the long-term patency of coronary artery bypass conduits (Figure 5 and Table 7)?

**Figure 5.** Operative image following completion of coronary artery bypass grafting surgery with the LIMA anastomosed to the LAD and SVG anastomosed to the diagonal, obtuse marginal and posterior descending artery. LIMA = left internal mammary artery; LAD = left anterior descending artery; SVG = saphenous vein graft; Ao = aorta; RV = right ventricle; LV = left ventricle.

| Free LIMA                                                      | 90% | 10-year patency |  |  |

| Gastroepiploic artery                                          | 63% | 10-year patency |  |  |

| Short saphenous vein                                           | 60% | 3-year patency  |  |  |
| Cephalic vein                                                  | 45% | 5-year patency  |  |  |
| Cryopreserved homograft vein                                   | 15% | 1-year patency  |  |  |

#### 23 **What is the evidence for using the radial artery as a conduit for CABG?**

- Several non-randomised retrospective studies have shown improved patency using radial artery as compared to long saphenous vein as the second graft in addition to the left internal mammary artery.
- This difference in long-term patency, however, has not been confirmed in the prospective, randomised controlled trials that have compared the two conduits, including the RAPCO study (Radial Artery Patency and Clinical Outcome), which showed the 5-year patency of saphenous vein grafts to be 94% compared to radial artery grafts at 87%. Subsequent data from the same trial showed the longer-term patency to be approximately 80% in both groups at 9 years.
- Radial artery grafts have been shown to have better patency on leftsided coronary targets with >70% stenosis.

#### 24 **What are the principles of using the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery graft (LIMA-LAD)?**

- The use of the LIMA-LAD, in addition to saphenous vein grafts, confers a 10% survival benefit at 10 years, compared to those who have saphenous vein grafts alone.
- The use of the left internal mammary artery as a conduit to bypass the left anterior descending artery has also been shown to improve peri-operative mortality, and freedom from angina, myocardial infarction and re-intervention.

#### 25 **When should the internal mammary artery be harvested as a skeletonised conduit (Figure 6)?**

- Use of bilateral skeletonised mammary arteries can reduce the incidence of mediastinitis and sternal dehiscence as compared to bilateral pedicled mammary arteries, especially in diabetic patients.
- In the only prospective, randomised trial comparing the two techniques of internal mammary harvest, skeletonisation was shown to reduce postoperative pain and improve sternal perfusion. There was, however, no difference in conduit length or arterial flow.
- Harvesting the mammary artery using a skeletonised technique, however, takes more time and may lead to increased endothelial damage and vasoreactivity.
- Furthermore, some studies have demonstrated reduced long-term patency of skeletonised mammary arteries.

![](_page_20_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Figure 6. Left internal mammary artery. A) Pedicled. B) Skeletonised.**

#### 26 **What is the evidence for using bilateral internal mammary arteries as a conduit for CABG?**

- Large retrospective studies and a meta-analysis have demonstrated a survival advantage, improved long-term patency and greater freedom from re-intervention using the right internal mammary artery as the second conduit for CABG as opposed to saphenous vein.
- Bilateral internal mammary artery harvest, however, is associated with an increased incidence of sternal dehiscence as compared to patients that only had a single internal mammary artery harvested.
- Long-term survival and patency results of bilateral internal mammary artery use are awaited from the prospective, randomised Arterial Revascularisation Trial (ART).

#### 27 **What are the principles of off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB)(Figure 7)?**

- The heart is appropriately positioned using deep pericardial sutures, an apical suction device (such as the Starfish®) and a coronary artery stabilising device (such as the Octopus®).
- The right pleural cavity may be opened to allow large hearts to be displaced into the right pleural space thus preventing mechanical

![](_page_21_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Figure 7. Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. SVG = saphenous vein graft.**

- compression of the right heart during grafting of the circumflex territory.
- Haemodynamic stability is maintained using a deep Trendelenburg position, fluid boluses and vasopressors.
- Following clearing of the epicardial fat, a snare is placed proximally to encircle the coronary artery.
- The coronary artery is then occluded, opened and the diameter of the vessel measured.
- An appropriately sized shunt (just smaller than the diameter of the vessel) is placed and the snare released.
- Coronary artery bypass grafting can then be performed with the aid of a Blower/Mister to enhance visualisation.

## 28 **What is the evidence for OPCAB surgery?**

- Although retrospective, non-randomised studies have shown improved morbidity and mortality using OPCAB as compared to CABG using standard cardiopulmonary bypass, these changes have not been consistently shown in the prospective randomised trials.
- The majority of these studies, however, have shown a reduced intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, need for blood transfusion and release of cardiac enzymes.
- Meta-analyses, however, have shown a reduced long-term patency and number of vessels revascularised with OPCAB as compared to CABG using standard cardiopulmonary bypass. Furthermore, certain coronary arteries (small, intramuscular, calcified vessels) may not be accessible during OPCAB and there is a high mortality when these patients need to be converted to cardiopulmonary bypass.

#### 29 **What are the principles of transmyocardial revascularisation (TMR)(Figure 8)?**

- TMR uses yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) or carbon dioxide (CO2) laser energy to create transmural myocardial channels, thereby directing oxygenated blood from the left ventricle into ischaemic myocardium mimicking the myocardial perfusion of the reptilian heart. The myocardial injury caused by the laser is also thought to improve myocardial blood supply by inducing angiogenesis.
- TMR can be used for patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease, on maximal medical treatment, who are not amenable to CABG or PCI.
- Studies have shown that TMR leads to an improvement in angina symptoms, exercise tolerance and myocardial perfusion but no increase in survival at 1 year.

![](_page_23_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 8. Transmyocardial revascularization. LV = left ventricular.**

• Attempts at percutaneous TMR failed to show any improvement in symptoms or exercise tolerance.

#### 30 **How are patients with carotid artery stenosis undergoing CABG managed?**

- Carotid screening is recommended in patients:
  - a) with a carotid bruit;
  - b) with a previous neurological event;
  - c) aged over 65 years;
  - d) with left main stem stenosis;
  - e) with a smoking history;
  - f) with peripheral vascular disease.
- The post-CABG risk of stroke is 2% in patients with a carotid stenosis <50%, 10% with a 50-80% stenosis, 15% with a stenosis >80% and 20% with an untreated high-grade bilateral carotid stenosis.

- According to the AHA guidelines (Class IIa), carotid endarterectomy is recommended prior to or concomitant with CABG for patients with asymptomatic unilateral stenosis >80% or symptomatic carotid stenosis.
- Carotid artery stenting can be used as an alternative to endarterectomy for patients with carotid artery stenosis.

## 31 **What are the principles of drug-eluting stents (DES)?**

- DES incorporate a drug (such as sirolimus or paclitaxel) that is released slowly over months, which impairs the cellular proliferation and fibromuscular hyperplasia healing response to stent deployment and balloon barotrauma.
- Complications of stent deployment include:
  - a) immediate complications, such as occlusion (stent thrombosis), embolism, dissection, side-branch occlusion and wire fracture;
  - b) emergency CABG (0.3%), mortality (0.5%), MI (0.8%), local vascular problems (2%);
  - c) in-stent stenosis, secondary to neointimal hyperplasia, which is reduced in DES as compared to bare metal stents;
  - d) late stent thrombosis, which is more common with DES as the polymer has inhibited endothelialisation of the stent, hence when dual antiplatelet therapy is stopped, there is an increased risk of thrombosis.

#### 32 **What did the VA coronary artery bypass grafting trial show?**

- VA = Veterans Administration.
- The VA trial was a prospective, randomised controlled study between in 686 men with coronary artery disease, including those with impaired left ventricular function (EF <35%), left main stem stenosis and aged >65 years old.
- The patients were randomised to either:
  - a) group I (n=354) optimal medical treatment;
  - b) group II (n=332) coronary artery bypass grafting and optimal medical treatment.

- For those undergoing CABG, the study demonstrated:
  - a) an overall survival advantage at 7 years follow-up (CABG 77% vs. medical treatment 70%) but not at 11 years (CABG 58% vs. medical treatment 57%);
  - a survival advantage for patients with impaired left ventricular function and three-vessel disease at 7 years follow-up (CABG 76% vs. medical treatment 52%) and at 11 years (CABG 50% vs. medical treatment 38%);
  - c) a survival advantage for patients with left main stem stenosis (CABG 80% vs. medical treatment 64%) at 7 years.

#### 33 What did the ECSS trial show?

- ECSS = European Coronary Surgery Study.
- The ECSS trial was a prospective, randomised controlled study between in 768 men with coronary artery disease, including those with good left ventricular function (EF <50% excluded) and two or more-vessel disease (single-vessel disease excluded).
- The patients were randomised to either:
  - a) group I (n=373) optimal medical treatment;
  - b) group II (n=395) coronary artery bypass grafting and optimal medical treatment.
- For those undergoing CABG, the study demonstrated:
  - a) an overall survival advantage at 5 years (CABG 92% vs. medical treatment 83%) and 12 years follow-up (CABG 71% vs. medical treatment 67%) but with the two groups becoming more convergent with time;
  - a decreased recurrence of angina (CABG 51% vs. medical treatment 80%);
  - c) a survival advantage for patients with proximal LAD stenosis (CABG 88% vs. medical treatment 79%) at 8 years;
  - a survival advantage for patients with three-vessel coronary artery disease (CABG 92% vs. medical treatment 77%) at 8 years.
- The convergence was attributed to saphenous vein graft stenosis, progression of the original native lesions, new coronary artery lesions and cross-over of patients from the medical group to the surgical group.

#### 34 What did the CASS trial show?

- CASS = Coronary Artery Surgery Study.
- The CASS trial was a prospective, randomised controlled study between in 780 patients (16% females) with coronary artery disease, excluding those with impaired left ventricular function (EF <35%) or aged >65 years old.
- The patients were randomised to either:
  - a) group I (n=390) optimal medical treatment;
  - b) group II (n=390) coronary artery bypass grafting and optimal medical treatment.
- At 10-year follow-up, for those undergoing CABG, the study demonstrated:
  - a) no significant overall survival difference;
  - b) a survival advantage for patients with impaired left ventricular function (CABG 80% vs. medical treatment 59%) and especially with three-vessel coronary disease.

#### 35 What did the Yusuf meta-analysis show?

- This meta-analysis collected data from 7 prospective, randomised studies between that compared coronary artery bypass grafting surgery with optimal medical management for patients with coronary artery disease.
- The study demonstrated a significant overall survival advantage and freedom from angina for patients in the CABG group at and 10 years but with the two groups becoming more convergent over time:
  - a) 5-year survival CABG 90% vs. optimal medical treatment 84%;
  - b) 7-year survival CABG 84% vs. optimal medical treatment 78%;
  - c) 10-year survival CABG 74% vs. optimal medical treatment 69%.
- In addition, subgroup analysis demonstrated a significant survival advantage for patients undergoing CABG, with left main stem stenosis, proximal LAD stenosis or three-vessel coronary artery disease.
- There was no significant difference between surgery and medical treatment for patients with one or two-vessel disease (without proximal LAD stenosis).

#### 36 What did the BARI trial show?

- BARI = Bypass Angioplasty Revascularisation Investigation.
- The BARI trial was a prospective, randomised controlled study between in 1829 patients with coronary artery disease (41% with three-vessel disease).
- The patients were randomised to either:
  - a) group I (n=915) percutaneous transluminal coronary (balloon) angioplasty (PTCA);
  - b) group II (n=914) coronary artery bypass grafting.
- At mean 5-year follow-up, for those undergoing CABG, the study demonstrated:
  - a) no overall survival advantage;
  - a decreased need for repeat revascularisation (CABG 8% vs. PTCA 54%);
  - c) a survival advantage for diabetic patients (CABG 81% vs. PTCA 65%).

#### 37 What did the RITA trial show?

- RITA = Randomised Intervention Treatment of Angina trial.
- The RITA trial was a prospective, randomised controlled study between in 1011 patients with coronary artery disease (12% with three-vessel disease), excluding patients with left main stem stenosis.
- The patients were randomised to either:
  - a) group I (n=510) percutaneous transluminal coronary (balloon) angioplasty (PTCA);
  - b) group II (n=501) coronary artery bypass grafting.
- At mean 5-year follow-up, for those undergoing CABG, the study demonstrated:
  - a) no overall survival advantage;
  - a decreased need for repeat revascularisation (CABG 12% vs. PTCA 53%);
  - a decreased recurrence of angina (CABG 34% vs. PTCA 49%).

#### 38 What did the ARTS trial show?

- ARTS = Arterial Revascularization Therapies Study.
- The ARTS trial was a prospective, randomised controlled study between in 1205 patients with coronary artery disease (30% with three-vessel disease), excluding patients with left main stem stenosis.
- The patients were randomised to either:
  - a) group I (n=600) percutaneous coronary intervention with bare metal stents;
  - b) group II (n=605) coronary artery bypass grafting.
- At mean 5-year follow-up, for those undergoing CABG, the study demonstrated:
  - a) no overall survival advantage;
  - a decreased need for repeat revascularisation (CABG 9% vs. PTCA 30%);
  - a decreased recurrence of angina (CABG 16% vs. PTCA 21%);
  - d) this difference was more marked in patients with diabetes mellitus.

#### 39 What did the SoS trial show?

- SoS = Stent or Surgery.
- The SoS trial was a prospective, randomised controlled study between in 988 patients with coronary artery disease (42% with three-vessel disease and 1% with left main stem stenosis).
- The patients were randomised to either:
  - a) group I (n=488) percutaneous coronary intervention with bare metal stents;
  - b) group II (n=500) coronary artery bypass grafting.
- At mean 2-year follow-up, for those undergoing CABG, the study demonstrated:
  - a) decreased mortality (CABG 2% vs. PCI 5%);
  - a decreased need for repeat revascularisation (CABG 6% vs. PCI 21%);
  - c) a decreased recurrence of angina (CABG 21% vs. PCI 34%).

#### 40 What did the SYNTAX trial show?

- SYNTAX = Synergy between PCI with TAXUS and cardiac surgery.
- The SYNTAX trial was a prospective, randomised controlled study between in 1800 patients with three-vessel coronary artery disease or left main stem stenosis.
- The patients were randomised to either:
  - a) group I (n=897) percutaneous coronary intervention with drug (paclitaxel)-eluting stents;
  - b) group II (n=903) coronary artery bypass grafting.
- At mean 1-year follow-up, for those undergoing CABG, the study demonstrated:
  - a) decreased major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events (CABG 12.4% vs. PCI 17.8%);
  - a decreased need for repeat revascularisation (CABG 6% vs. PCI 13%);
  - c) an increased rate of stroke (CABG 2.2% vs. PCI 0.6%);
  - d) no difference for death or myocardial infarction.
- At mean 3-year follow-up, the difference in the stroke rate was no longer significant (CABG 3.4% vs. PCI 2.0%). The CABG group, however, still had significantly decreased major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events (CABG 20.2% vs. PCI 28.0%), MI (CABG 3.6% vs. PCI 7.1%) and repeat revascularisation (CABG 10.7% vs. PCI 19.7%) rates.
- The study concluded that CABG remains the standard of care for patients with three-vessel or left main coronary artery disease.

#### 41 What did the ROOBY trial show?

- ROOBY = Randomized On/Off Bypass Study.
- The ROOBY trial was a prospective randomised study in 2203 patients undergoing urgent or elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
- The patients were randomised to:
  - a) group I (n=1104) off-pump CABG; or
  - b) group II (n=1099) on-pump CABG.

- The study demonstrated:
  - a) 12.4% of patients in the off-pump group required intraoperative conversion to on-pump CABG;
  - b) no difference in short-term (30-day) outcomes, including death, reoperation, stroke, renal failure or additional mechanical support;
  - c) higher composite outcome of death, myocardial infarction and repeat revascularisation after 1 year in the off-pump group (offpump 9.9% vs. on-pump 7.4%);
  - d) lower graft patency at 1 year in the off-pump group (off-pump 82.6% vs. on-pump 87.8%).
- The study concluded that patients undergoing off-pump CABG had worse composite outcomes and graft patencies at 1 year.
