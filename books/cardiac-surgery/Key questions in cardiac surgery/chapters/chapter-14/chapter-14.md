### Tricuspid valve disease

#### 1 **What are the causes of tricuspid regurgitation (TR)?**

- Normal leaflet motion annular dilation (secondary to pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure, mitral valve disease), infective endocarditis.
- Excessive leaflet motion myxomatous degeneration.
- Restricted leaflet motion rheumatic fever, Ebstein's anomaly.

#### 2 **What is Ebstein's anomaly?**

- It is defined as dysplasia of the tricuspid valve leaflets (Figure 1) resulting in:
  - a) fused, perforated or absent leaflets with abnormal chordae;
  - b) apical displacement of the septal leaflet into the body of the right ventricle;
  - c) a thin atrialised portion of the right ventricle;
  - d) severe right ventricular dysfunction and dilation;
  - e) tricuspid regurgitation;
  - f) right ventricular outflow tract obstruction caused by the displaced leaflets.
- Ebstein's anomaly is also associated with rhythm disturbances, including supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

**Figure 1. Ebstein's anomaly. The septal leaflet (SL) is hypoplastic and plastered to the interventricular septum (IVS), and the posterior leaflet is absent. A large segment of atrialised ventricle occupies the posterior aspect of the inlet of the right ventricle. A small opening towards the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) is seen beneath the anterior leaflet. NCC = non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve; RCA = right coronary artery; CS = coronary sinus; IVS = interventricular septum; AL = anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve; SL = septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve; RVOT = right ventricular outflow tract; RV = right ventricle; AV node = atrioventricular node.**

#### 3 What are the symptoms of tricuspid regurgitation?

- Dyspnoea and fatigue due to reduced cardiac output.
- Peripheral oedema and ascites due to back pressure on the systemic venous circulation.

#### 4 What are the signs of tricuspid regurgitation?

- Increased jugular venous pressure with a prominent V wave.
- Peripheral oedema and ascites.
- Pan-systolic murmur prominent at the left sternal edge, increased with inspiration.
- 3rd heart sound (gallop rhythm).
- Right ventricular heave.
- Jaundice secondary to hepatic congestion in severe TR.

## 5 How is tricuspid regurgitation quantified by echocardiography?

- According to the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, the main criteria is a vena contracta (narrowest part of regurgitant jet) width >0.7cm for severe TR.
- Severe TR is also associated with systolic flow reversal in the hepatic veins.
- Additional methods used to quantify tricuspid regurgitation include using colour-flow Doppler to measure the size of the regurgitant jet in relation to the right atrium, PISA (proximal isovelocity area) radius and right atrial size.

#### 6 What are the causes of tricuspid stenosis (TS)?

- Rheumatic fever.
- Carcinoid heart disease.
- Congenital tricuspid stenosis.

#### 7 What are the symptoms of tricuspid stenosis?

- Dyspnoea and fatigue due to reduced cardiac output.
- Peripheral oedema and ascites due to back pressure on the systemic venous circulation.

#### 8 What are the signs of tricuspid stenosis?

- Increased jugular venous pressure with a prominent A wave.
- Peripheral oedema and ascites.
- Tricuspid opening snap.
- Diastolic rumbling murmur prominent at the left sternal edge, increased with inspiration.
- Split 1st heart sound.

#### How is tricuspid stenosis quantified by echocardiography?

- According to the AHA guidelines, the main criteria is a tricuspid valve area (TVA) <1cm² for severe TS.</li>
- The TVA can be calculated by the continuity equation or planimetry.
- The mean tricuspid diastolic pressure gradient can also be used to quantify tricuspid stenosis.

### 10 What are the indications for tricuspid valve surgery in the absence of mitral valve disease?

#### **AHA** guidelines

- Class IIa severe TR in symptomatic patients.
- Other considerations include tricuspid valve annulus size (>40mm), right ventricular function and size, pulmonary hypertension (>50mmHg at rest, 60mmHg on exercise), right atrial size and the presence of atrial fibrillation.

### What are the indications for tricuspid valve repair in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery?

#### AHA guidelines

- Class I: severe TR.
- Class IIb: less than severe TR with pulmonary hypertension or a dilated tricuspid valve annulus (>40mm).

#### 12 **What are the surgical options for tricuspid valve annular dilation?**

- Bicuspidisation/plication of the tricuspid valve a running suture along the posterior TV annulus to shorten or eliminate the posterior leaflet resulting in a bicuspid valve.
- De Vega annuloplasty (Figure 2) two arms of a running suture weaving along the TV annulus from the anteroseptal to posteroseptal commissures. The first arm of the weaved suture is started at the anteroseptal commissure, superficially and close to the annulus, to avoid the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve. This is then continued clockwise to the posteroseptal commissure. The suture is then weaved back counter-clockwise and secured with Teflon® pledgets at both ends (Figure 2A). The stitch is tightened over an appropriately sized Hegar dilator (Figure 2B).
- Ring annuloplasty (Figures 3 and 4) using interrupted mattress sutures, an appropriately sized tricuspid valve ring is implanted into the tricuspid valve annulus.
- During tricuspid valve surgery it is important to avoid the atrioventricular node and Bundle of His, which are located in the triangle of Koch.

### 13 What structures are at risk during tricuspid valve surgery (Figure 5)?

- Atrioventricular node (at the centre of the triangle of Koch) and Bundle of His (at the apex of the triangle of Koch).
- Aortic valve (non-coronary cusp).
- Coronary sinus.
- Right coronary artery.
- Atrioventricular nodal artery.

#### 14 **How is the tricuspid valve annulus sized for ring annuloplasty (Figure 6)?**

- Annuloplasty sizers, which measure the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve.
- Alternatively, fixed sizes of 30-32mm for women and 32-34mm for men are used.
