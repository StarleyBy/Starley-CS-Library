## Infective endocarditis

#### What is the risk of infective endocarditis?

- Native valve endocarditis has an incidence of cases per persons per year.
- The risk of prosthetic valve endocarditis is 0.5-1% per year following valve surgery.
- Infective endocarditis usually affects the left-sided valves (mitral valve more common than the aortic valve) with 5% of cases involving the tricuspid valve and the pulmonary valve rarely being affected.

### 2 What is the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis?

- Normal cardiac endothelium is resistant to infection.
- Even with transient bacteraemia, normal immune mechanisms including thrombocidins (microbicidal proteins released by platelets) prevent endocarditis.
- Risk factors for native valve endocarditis include:
  - a) endothelial disruption;
  - b) valvular lesions such as aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation resulting in non-laminar flow.
- These risk factors induce platelet-fibrin thrombus formation with subsequent bacterial colonisation resulting in vegetation formation and spread into the surrounding tissues or embolisation.

### 3 What are the clinical features of infective endocarditis?

- Clinical features of infection fever, night sweats, rigors, weight loss, malaise, anaemia, and clubbing and splenomegaly if chronic.
- Clinical features of immune complex deposition are:
  - a) Roth spots retinal boat-shaped haemorrhage with a pale centre;
  - b) splinter haemorrhages thin reddish-brown lines in the nailbed;

- Osler's nodes painful pulp infarcts on fingers, toes, palms or soles;
- d) Janeway lesions painless flat palmar or plantar erythema;
- e) vasculitis (brain, skin, kidney) and arthralgia.
- Clinical features of the cardiac lesion new or changing murmur, heart block, heart failure, pyopericardium.
- Clinical features of emboli (cerebral, retinal, splenic, mesenteric, renal or lower limb), resulting in organ infarct or abscess, especially with fungal endocarditis (due to friable emboli).

## 4 What are the commonest organisms in patients with native valve infective endocarditis?

- Streptococcus (45%) viridans (including milleri, oralis, mitis, mutans, salivarius) or bovis.
- Staphylococcus aureus or epidermidis (35%).
- Enterococcus faecalis (10%).
- Diptheroid bacilli and micro-aerophilic Streptococci.
- HACEK organisms (see below).
- Anaerobic gram negative bacilli Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, Streptobacillus moniliformis, Propionibacterium acnes, Listeria monocytogenes, Brucella abortus, Legionella.
- Coxiella burnetii (Q fever).
- Chlamydia psittaci or trachomatis.
- Fungal Candida, Aspergillus, Histoplasma.

## 5 What are the HACEK organisms?

- A group of gram negative fastidious bacilli that require prolonged culture in 10% CO<sub>2</sub>:
  - a) Haemophilus species (including aphrophilus but not influenzae);
  - b) Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans;
  - c) Cardiobacterium hominis;
  - d) Eikenella corrodens;
  - e) Kingella kingae.

- What are the commonest organisms in patients with early (<2 months) prosthetic valve infective endocarditis?
- Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis (45-50%).
- Gram negative bacilli.
- Fungi.

- What are the commonest organisms in patients with late (>2 months) prosthetic valve infective endocarditis?
- Streptococcus viridans (45%).
- Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis (35%).
- Enterococcus faecalis (10%).
- 8 Which antibiotics should be used for the common organisms in infective endocarditis?
- If the organism is unknown benzylpenicillin and gentamicin should be used (to cover the main organisms, especially *Streptococcus*) or vancomycin and gentamicin (if *Staphylococcus* is suspected).
- Streptococcus viridans benzylpenicillin and gentamicin.
- Staphylococcus aureus vancomycin and gentamicin.
- Enterococcus amoxycillin and gentamicin.
- HACEK (often beta-lactam resistant) ceftriaxone.
- 9 What are the causes of culture-negative infective endocarditis?
- Prior antibiotic therapy.
- Slow-growing or fastidious organisms (HACEK, nutritionally variant Streptococci, Brucella, Legionella, Corynebacterium, Listeria, Bartonella).
- Fungal endocarditis.
- Obligate intracellular parasites (Coxiella burnetii, Chlamydiae).
- Non-infective endocarditis (marantic endocarditis) see below.

## 10 What are the causes of non-infective (marantic) endocarditis?

- Mucinous adenocarcinoma (pancreas, lung, upper gastrointestinal tract).
- Other malignant disease lymphoma, bladder carcinoma.
- Anti-phospholipid syndrome (Hughes' syndrome).
- Acute rheumatic fever (Lancefield group A β-haemolytic Streptococcus).
- Libman-Sacks endocarditis (systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma).

# What are the causes of persistent or recurrent fever in patients with suspected infective endocarditis whilst on antibiotic treatment?

- Wrong antibiotic.
- Wrong diagnosis.
- Spread of infection paravalvular or intracardiac abscess, metastatic infection or mycotic aneurysm.
- Secondary infection, e.g. hospital-acquired chest infection, venous line infection.
- Antibiotic hypersensitivity (usually penicillin).

# 12 What are Duke's major criteria for infective endocarditis?

- Three positive blood cultures (12 hours apart) showing typical organisms - Streptococcus viridans or bovis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococci, HACEK.
- Evidence of endocardial infection vegetation, abscess, prosthetic valve dehiscence, new regurgitation.

# 13 What are Duke's minor criteria for infective endocarditis?

- Predisposing factors (e.g. cardiac lesion, intravenous drug abuser).
- Fever >38°C.
- Embolic or vascular phenomena (e.g. splinter haemorrhages, vasculitis).
- Immunological phenomena (e.g. Osler's nodes, Roth spots).
- Serology consistent with infective endocarditis.
- Blood cultures compatible with but not typical for endocarditis.

• Other echocardiographic findings consistent with infective endocarditis and not covered by major criteria.

## 14 **What is the significance of Duke's criteria?**

- Definite endocarditis (specificity 99%, sensitivity >80%):
  - a) clinical diagnosis is made by:
    - i) two major criteria;
    - ii) one major and three minor criteria;
    - iii) five minor criteria;
    - iv) pathological diagnosis by histological evidence of active infective endocarditis (from surgical specimen or post mortem).
- Possible endocarditis findings consistent with infective endocarditis but do not satisfy the requirements of definite infective endocarditis.
- Rejected diagnosis of endocarditis:
  - a) firm alternative diagnosis;
  - b) resolution of manifestations within 4 days of antibiotic treatment;
  - c) no evidence of infective endocarditis at surgery or post mortem after therapy for >4 days.

### 15 **What are the indications for surgery in patients with native valve endocarditis (Figure 1)?**

#### *AHA guidelines*

- Class I:
  - a) valvular regurgitation or stenosis leading to heart failure;
  - b) aortic or mitral regurgitation with raised left ventricular enddiastolic pressure, left atrial pressure or moderate pulmonary hypertension;
  - c) infective endocarditis caused by fungal or highly resistant organisms;
  - d) local invasion resulting in heart block, annular or aortic abscess, fistula or leaflet perforation.
- Class IIa: recurrent emboli with persistent vegetation despite antibiotics.
- Class IIb: mobile vegetation >10mm.

### 16 **What are the indications for surgery in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis (Figure 2)?**

#### *AHA guidelines*

- Class I: heart failure, valve dehiscence, worsening regurgitation or obstruction, or local invasion.
- Class IIa: persistent bacteraemia or recurrent emboli despite antibiotic therapy, or relapsing infection.
- Class III (contra-indication): uncomplicated prosthetic valve endocarditis with a sensitive organism.

## 17 What are the principles of surgery for infective endocarditis?

- Debridement of infected tissues.
- Closure of cardiac defects
- Valve repair or replacement (repair is the preferred option in mitral and tricuspid valve endocarditis, especially if <50% of the valve is affected).
- Aortic homografts are useful in patients with aortic root abscesses.
- In intravenous drug abuse patients with tricuspid valve endocarditis, it may be necessary to perform tricuspid valvectomy without replacement to reduce the risk of recurrence but only in the absence of significant pulmonary hypertension.

# 18 What are the treatment options for aortic peri-annular abscesses?

- Bovine pericardial patch.
- Aortic valve homograft.

# 19 What is the operative mortality and long-term survival of patients undergoing surgery for infective endocarditis?

- Operative mortality native valve endocarditis 5-10%, prosthetic valve endocarditis 10-20%.
- 5-year survival native valve endocarditis 80%, prosthetic valve endocarditis 60%.

# 20 What are the antibiotic prophylaxis regimes for patients with prosthetic cardiac valves used prior to dental procedures?

- Standard amoxycillin (3g oral 1 hr pre-operatively or 2g IV 30 min pre-operatively).
- Standard (patients with penicillin allergy) clindamycin (600mg oral 1 hr pre-operatively).
- Patients with previous infective endocarditis amoxycillin (2g IV 30 min pre-operatively) and gentamicin (120mg IV 30 min pre-operatively).
- Patients with previous infective endocarditis and penicillin allergy vancomycin (1g IV 1 hr pre-operatively) and gentamicin (120mg IV 30 min pre-operatively).
- Recently, NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) guidelines have suggested that prophylactic antibiotics are not

required for all patients with prosthetic valves undergoing dental procedures. These guidelines, however, are very controversial and many surgeons still advocate the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis in these patients.
