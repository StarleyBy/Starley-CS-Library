### 4 What are the causes of acidosis following cardiac surgery?

- Metabolic acidosis:
  - a) reduced tissue perfusion producing lactic acidosis, secondary to:
    - i) hypovolaemia;
    - ii) low cardiac output;
    - iii) myocardial dysfunction;
    - iv) excessive vasoconstriction (noradrenaline, vasopressin, methylene blue, hypothermia);
    - v) sepsis;
  - b) increased metabolic activity (adrenaline, sepsis);
  - c) renal impairment (failure to excrete hydrogen ions);
  - splanchnic or limb ischaemia (excess production of hydrogen ions);
  - e) endocrine hyperglycaemia, thyrotoxic crisis.
- Respiratory acidosis CO<sub>2</sub> retention.

#### What are the principles of managing acidosis postcardiac surgery?

- Identify the underlying cause:
  - a) assess for clinical aetiology as described above (e.g. volume status, temperature, inotropy, urine output);
  - b) determine pH, pCO<sub>2</sub>, base excess, lactate, anion gap, blood glucose, urinary ketones, phosphate.
- Treat the underlying cause:
  - a) increase the respiratory rate or tidal volume (i.e. minute volume to increase CO<sub>2</sub> expiration) to treat respiratory acidosis;
  - b) optimise cardiac output;
  - c) reduce noradrenaline and adrenaline if possible;
  - d) restore normothermia with a warming blanket;
  - e) optimise renal function with volume, furosemide or dopamine;
  - f) consider sodium bicarbonate (50mL 8.4%) or dialysis.

### What are the causes of hyperkalaemia following cardiac surgery?

- Excess intravenous or oral potassium administration.
- Potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. amiloride).
- Aldosterone antagonist (e.g. spironolactone).
- Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).

- Reduced renal excretion of potassium with renal failure or oliguria.
- Tissue ischaemia causing increased potassium release from cells.

#### How is hyperkalaemia treated following cardiac surgery?

- Re-check the serum potassium level (ensure the sample is not haemolysed).
- Cardiac monitoring.
- Reduce potassium uptake:

  - a) insulin (give 50mL 50% dextrose and 15U insulin IV);
  - b) sodium bicarbonate;
  - c) aerosolized  $\beta$ -agonist.
- Increase potassium excretion:

### 11 **How is hyponatraemia treated following cardiac surgery?**

- Management depends on the underlying cause and volume status.

  - b) replace any 5% dextrose with normal hypertonic saline;
  - c) loop diuretics may be used to excrete free water.
- Euvolaemic hyponatraemia:
  - a) demeclocycline which reduces the effect of ADH on the distal renal tubules;

### 14 What are the common causes of hypoxia in the immediate postoperative period?

- Atelectasis caused by:
  - a) general anaesthesia;
  - b) cardiopulmonary bypass secondary to:
    - i) inadequate surfactant from pulmonary hypoperfusion;
    - ii) small airway closure from vasoactive mediators;
    - iii) increased interstitial oedema due to increased alveolar endothelial permeability;
  - c) left internal mammary artery harvesting.
- Pleural effusion.
- Bronchospasm.
- Pneumonia.
- Pneumothorax.
- Cardiogenic pulmonary oedema.
- Non-cardiogenic interstitial pulmonary oedema caused by systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) secondary to complement

- activation, cytokine release, oxygen-free radicals and blood transfusion products.
- Diaphragmatic dysfunction phrenic nerve injury, which can be caused by iced pericardial slush or direct injury.

### 15 What are the common causes of oliguria in the immediate postoperative period?

- Pre-renal:
  - a) hypovolaemia (intravascular volume depletion);
  - b) low cardiac output;
  - c) renal artery disease especially following aortic dissection.

#### Renal:

- a) pre-operative renal disease hypertensive, diabetic, contrast nephropathy;
- b) nephrotoxic drugs gentamicin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs;
- c) cardiopulmonary bypass-induced nephropathy;
- d) sepsis.
- Post-renal rare as most patients are catheterised but may be caused by blockage or kinking of the urinary catheter.

### 16 How is oliguria managed?

- Ensure the urinary catheter is patent.
- Optimise myocardial function to ensure adequate renal perfusion:
  - a) preload fluid boluses;
  - b) improve contractility with inotropes;
  - c) reduce elevated afterload;
  - d) manage any dysrhythmias;
  - e) intra-aortic balloon pump if necessary.
- Diuretics initially with boluses followed by an infusion if unsuccessful.
- Renal-dose dopamine (1-5μg/kg/min).
- Renal dialysis for hyperkalaemia, acidosis, excessive fluid retention (e.g. pulmonary oedema).

### 17 **What are the principles of enteral feeding in cardiac surgical patients?**

- Most cardiac surgical patients require approximately 25kCal/kg/day.
- Patients in a catabolic state (such as with multi-organ failure) have increased nutritional requirements (approximately 30kCal/kg/day).
- Enteral (nasogastric) feeding should be commenced if a patient is not extubated or is not able to eat within 48 hours of surgery.
- Standard feeds provide.2kCal/mL with high-energy feeds providing 1.5-2kCal/mL.
- Patients with renal failure require low-protein feeds, except those requiring renal replacement therapy, who require high-protein feeds (as haemofiltration and haemodialysis remove protein). These patients also require high-energy (low volume) and low-electrolyte feeds.
- Enteral feeding is usually given over hours with a 4-8-hour rest period.
- Total parenteral nutrition should be used if the patient is not absorbing or if there is any contra-indication to enteral feeding.

### 18 **What are the principles of managing sternal wound infections post-cardiac surgery?**

- Prevention:
  - a) antibiotic prophylaxis cefuroxime administered 30 minutes before incision or vancomycin if the patient is at risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA);
  - b) infection control avoid cross-contamination between patients.
- Isolate the organism and treat with the appropriate antibiotic therapy.
- Superficial sternal wound infection can be treated with drainage but may require vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) pump insertion.
- Deep sternal wound infection and mediastinitis, however, requires:
  - a) sternal debridement and VAC pump insertion or closure with a continuous irrigation system;
  - b) antibiotic therapy tailored to the infecting organism;
  - c) sternal reconstruction is performed once inflammatory markers have normalised and the infecting organism has been eradicated as demonstrated by negative microbiological swabs, with:
    - i) sternal rewiring;
    - ii) pectoral advancement flaps;
    - iii) plastic surgical flap reconstruction using latissimus dorsi, pectoralis major, rectus abdominis or the omentum.

#### 19 **What are the standard anticoagulation regimes following cardiac surgery?**

- According to the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, the following INRs (international normalized ratios) are recommended using warfarin:
  - a) coronary endarterectomy 2.0-3.0;
  - b) atrial fibrillation 2.0-3.0;
  - c) mechanical aortic valve 2.0-3.0;
  - d) mechanical mitral valve 2.5-3.5.
- For patients with bioprosthetic valves, aspirin alone can be used or 3 months of warfarin (with optimal INR 2.0-3.0) followed by aspirin alone.

### 20 **What medications are important for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease?**

- Aspirin (antiplatelet agent), which reduces the risk of subsequent coronary thrombosis.
- Statin (HMG CoA reductase inhibitor), which reduces hepatic production of cholesterol and subsequent deposition in the coronary arteries and vein grafts.
- b-blocker, which decreases left ventricular work by reducing left ventricular contractility and afterload.
- Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, which reduces left ventricular afterload and encourages left ventricular reverse remodelling.
