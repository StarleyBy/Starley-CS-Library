1 **Describe the anatomy of the coronary artery system (Figure 1)**

![](_page_0_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 1. Coronary artery system. SVC = superior vena cava; RAA = right atrial appendage; IVC = inferior vena cava; RCS = right coronary sinus; RCA = right coronary artery; LCS = left coronary sinus; LMCA = left main coronary artery; LAA = left atrial appendage; Cx = circumflex artery; LAD = left anterior descending artery.**

- The coronary artery system originates from the aortic root and consists of the left and right coronary arteries and their individual branches.
- The left coronary artery originates from the left coronary ostium as the left main stem and divides early into the left anterior descending artery (also known as the anterior interventricular artery) and circumflex artery (see below).
- The right coronary artery originates from the right coronary ostium and eventually terminates as the posterior descending artery (also known as the posterior interventricular artery) and posterior left ventricular artery (see below).

#### 2 **Describe the anatomy of the left main coronary artery (Figure 2)**

- The left main coronary artery (left main stem) courses from the left coronary sinus of the aorta in an anterior and inferior direction between the pulmonary trunk and the left atrial appendage.
- It then divides into two major arteries of nearly equal diameter, the left anterior descending artery and the circumflex artery. Typically, no branches are seen before this bifurcation.

![](_page_1_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Figure 2. Bifurcation and trifurcation of the left main coronary artery.**

- In some patients, the left main coronary artery trifurcates into the intermediate coronary artery (ramus intermedius), left anterior descending artery and circumflex artery.
- The left main coronary artery is typically 10-40mm in length but may be absent in patients with separate circumflex and left anterior descending coronary ostia.

#### 3 **Describe the anatomy of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery (Figure 3)**

• The LAD artery courses anteriorly and inferiorly in the anterior interventricular groove towards the apex of the heart.

![](_page_2_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Figure 3. Left anterior descending (LAD) artery and its branches.**

- Occasionally, the LAD continues around the apex to supply part of the posterior interventricular groove and rarely even replaces the posterior descending artery.
- In 4% of patients, the LAD bifurcates proximally and continues as two equal sized parallel vessels down the anterior interventricular groove.
- The main branches of the LAD include:
  - a) diagonal arteries (usually in number) which course along and supply the anterolateral wall of the left ventricle;
  - b) septal perforator arteries (usually in number) which branch perpendicularly into and supply the anterior two thirds of the ventricular septum. The first septal artery is the largest and runs perpendicularly towards the medial papillary muscle of the tricuspid valve. It is at risk during the Ross procedure as it lies immediately beneath the right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonary valve;
  - c) right ventricular branches, which supply blood to the anterior surface of the right ventricle but are not always present.

![](_page_3_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Figure 4. Segments of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery.**

- The LAD is divided into (Figure 4):
  - a) a proximal third, which runs from the origin of the LAD to the origin of the first septal artery;
  - b) a middle third, which runs from the first septal artery to the origin of the last diagonal artery;
  - c) a distal third, which runs from the last diagonal artery to the termination of the LAD.

#### 4 **Describe the course of the circumflex coronary artery (Figure 5)**

• The circumflex coronary artery courses along the left atrioventricular groove and in 85-90% of patients terminates before reaching the posterior interventricular groove. In 10-15% of patients, the circumflex coronary artery continues as the posterior descending artery.

![](_page_4_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Figure 5. Circumflex artery and its branches. LAA = left atrial appendage; PA = pulmonary artery.**

- The main branches of the circumflex coronary artery include:
  - a) obtuse marginal arteries that supply the lateral aspect of the left ventricular wall, including the anterolateral papillary muscle of the mitral valve;
  - b) left atrial branches;
  - c) sino-atrial nodal artery (in 45% of patients);
  - d) atrioventricular nodal artery (in 10-15% of patients);
  - e) posterior descending artery (in 10-15% of patients).

#### 5 **Describe the anatomy of the right coronary artery (RCA)(Figure 6)**

- The RCA courses anteriorly and laterally from its origin at the right coronary ostium, descending into the right atrioventricular groove and inferiorly towards the acute margin of the right ventricle.
- It courses around to the inferior surface of the heart and after giving off the posterior descending artery, it continues as the posterior left ventricular artery.

![](_page_5_Picture_11.jpeg)

**Figure 6. Right coronary artery (RCA) and its branches. SA = sino-atrial; AV = atrioventricular.** 

#### • The main branches of the RCA include:

- a) sino-atrial nodal artery (in 55% of patients) (see below);
- b) infundibular (or conus) branch that courses anteriorly over the right ventricular infundibulum;
- c) acute marginal branch that courses over the acute margin of the right ventricle;
- d) anterior right ventricular branches that supply the anterior free wall of the right ventricle;
- e) atrioventricular nodal artery (in 85-90% of patients) (see below);
- f) posterior descending artery (in 85-90% of patients), which runs in the posterior interventricular groove and gives off septal perforator arteries which branch perpendicularly into and supply the posterior one third of the ventricular septum;
- g) posterior left ventricular artery that supplies the posterior surface of the left ventricle.

#### 6 **How is dominance of the coronary artery system determined?**

- Dominance refers to the artery from which the posterior descending artery originates and not the vessel which supplies the greater absolute myocardial muscle mass.
- A right dominant system occurs in 80-85% of patients, with a left dominant system in 10-15% and a codominant system in approximately 5% of patients.
- Left dominance occurs slightly more frequently in males and in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve.

## 7 **Describe the coronary venous drainage system**

- The majority of coronary veins (see below) drain via the coronary sinus into the right atrium.
- The coronary sinus is a continuation of the great cardiac vein and the change is denoted by the valve of Vieussens and entry of the oblique vein of the left atrium (the vein of Marshall).
- Several Thebesian veins and larger anterior veins drain directly into the right atrium, thereby bypassing the coronary sinus.

8 **What are the anatomical locations of the main coronary veins and with which coronary arteries does each vein run (Figure 7; Table 1)?**

## 9 **Describe the conduction system of the heart (Figure 8)**

- The cardiac conduction system consists of:
  - a) sino-atrial (SA) node (see below);
  - b) anterior, middle and posterior internodal tracts in the right atrium as well as Bachmann's bundle in the left atrium;
  - c) atrioventricular node (see below);
  - d) bundle of His, which penetrates the central fibrous body to reach the membranous septum to lie on the crest of the muscular ventricular septum just beneath the commissure between the right and non-coronary cusps of the aortic valve;
  - e) bundle branches:
    - i) left bundle branch, which divides into anterior and posterior fascicles that run sub-endocardially down the septal surface of the left ventricle to the apex;
    - ii) right bundle branch, which runs on the right side of the ventricular septum towards the base of the medial papillary muscle of the tricuspid valve into the body of the septomarginal trabeculation and traversing the right ventricular cavity through the moderator band;
  - f) Purkinje fibres.

![](_page_9_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 8. Conduction system of the heart. While the conduction fibres originating from the AV node are recognisable anatomic structures surrounded by a capsule of fibrous tissue, the connections between the SA node and the AV node are less defined, therefore they are named tracts rather than bundles. The so-called Bundle of Bachmann propagates the electric impulse to the left atrium through the interatrial septum. SA = sinoatrial; AV = atrioventricular.** 

## 10 **Describe the location of the sino-atrial node (Figure 9)**

• The sino-atrial node is an elliptical or horse-shoe-shaped subepicardial structure that lies just lateral to the junction of the superior vena cava and the roof of the right atrium at the superior end of the terminal groove (sulcus terminalis).

![](_page_10_Picture_4.jpeg)

![](_page_10_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Figure 9. Anatomical location of the sino-atrial (SA) node. SVC = superior vena cava.** 

## 11 **What is the blood supply of the sino-atrial node?**

- The sino-atrial nodal artery originates from the RCA in 55% of patients and the circumflex coronary artery in 45% of patients.
- The sino-atrial nodal artery passes in front of the junction between the superior vena cava and right atrial roof in 60% of patients, behind the junction in 33% and around the junction in 7%.

#### 12 **Describe the location of the atrioventricular node (Figures 10 and 11)**

- The atrioventricular node lies within the triangle of Koch.
- The boundaries of the triangle of Koch include:
  - a) the tendon of Todaro;
  - b) the hinge of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve;
  - c) the superior margin of the coronary sinus.
- The membranous septum lies just superior to the triangle of Koch and is where the bundle of His penetrates to enter the muscular septum.

**Figure 11. Anatomical location of the atrioventricular node. NCC = non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve; AL = anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve; RCA = right coronary artery; AV = atrioventricular; PL = posterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve; SL = septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve; TV = tricuspid valve.**

## 13 **What is the blood supply of the atrioventricular node?**

• The atrioventricular nodal artery supplies the node and originates from the RCA in approximately 85-90% of patients with the remaining 10-15% originating from the circumflex coronary artery.

#### 14 **Describe the anatomy of the aortic valve (Figures 12 and 13)**

![](_page_13_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Figure 12. Anatomical relations of the aortic valve. The fibrous trigones provide continuity between the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve and the left coronary and non-coronary cusps of the aortic valve. RCA = right coronary artery; LMCA = left main coronary artery; RCC = right coronary cusp; NCC = non-coronary cusp; LCC = left coronary cusp; AMVL = anterior mitral valve leaflet; MS = membranous septum; IVS = interventricular septum; LVOT = left ventricular outflow tract.**

![](_page_14_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 13. Operative view of the aortic valve. NCC = non-coronary cusp; LCC = left coronary cusp; RCC = right coronary cusp.**

- The aortic valve consists of three semilunar leaflets:
  - a) right coronary cusp;
  - b) left coronary cusp;
  - c) non-coronary (posterior) cusp.
- The leaflets are formed by a fibrous core and an endothelial lining.
- The fibrous core is thickened at the free edge of the leaflet, especially centrally, which is known as the nodule of Arantius.
- The leaflets coapt at the free edge of their ventricular surface with three zones of apposition.
- The commissures are the points of contact between the leaflets on the aortic wall.

## 15 **Describe the anatomy of the aortic root (Figure 14)**

- Competency of the aortic valve is maintained by several different components of the aortic root working in harmony:
  - a) aortic valve leaflets (see above);

![](_page_15_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 14. Structure of the aortic root. The valve leaflets have been removed. Note how the level of the basal attachment of the cusps is lower than the anatomical ventriculo-arterial junction. LVOT = left ventricular outflow tract; IVS = interventricular septum; AMVL = anterior mitral valve leaflet.**

- b) sinuses of Valsalva, which allow the aortic valve leaflets to fall back during systole thereby enabling a column of blood to pass unobstructed from the left ventricle into the aorta:
  - i) right coronary sinus;
  - ii) left coronary sinus;
  - iii) non-coronary sinus;
- c) junctions (anatomical and physiological):
  - i) sinotubular junction between the distal part of the sinuses and the proximal part of the ascending aorta;
  - ii) anatomical ventriculo-arterial junction between the ventricular myocardium and aortic sinuses;
  - iii) basal ring that joins the inferior aspect of the valve leaflets.
- The haemodynamic border between the ventricle and aorta, however, is demarcated by the leaflet attachments and not by the junctions described above.

• As the crown-shaped line of leaflet attachment crosses the anatomical ventriculo-arterial junction, it leaves triangles of arterial wall on the ventricular aspects of the leaflet attachment and semicircular areas of ventricular myocardium within the aortic sinuses.

## 16 **Describe the anatomy of the pulmonary valve**

- The pulmonary valve consists of three semilunar leaflets:
  - a) right cusp;
  - b) left cusp;
  - c) anterior cusp.
- Competency of the pulmonary valve is maintained by similar structures to the aortic valve.

## 17 **Describe the anatomy of the mitral valve (Figure 15)**

- The mitral valve consists of two leaflets:
  - a) anterior (aortic) mitral valve leaflet;
  - b) posterior (mural) mitral valve leaflet.
- The anterior and posterior mitral valve leaflets are further subdivided by clefts into scallops, known as A1, A2, A3, P1, P2 and P3, respectively.

![](_page_16_Picture_14.jpeg)

**Figure 15. Anatomical view of the mitral valve. SZA = solitary zone of apposition.**

- The mitral valve annulus is kidney-shaped with the posterior mitral valve annulus taking up two thirds of the circumference and the anterior mitral valve annulus taking up one third.
- The anterior mitral valve leaflet takes up approximately two thirds of the cross-sectional area of the mitral valve orifice with the posterior mitral valve leaflet taking up one third. Hence, the line of apposition is closer to the posterior mitral valve annulus.

#### 18 **Describe the tension apparatus of the mitral valve (Figures 16 and 17)**

- Competency of the mitral valve is maintained by several different components of the mitral valve and sub-valvular apparatus acting in harmony:
  - a) leaflets (see above);
  - b) papillary muscles:
    - i) the anterolateral papillary muscle has a single head and takes its blood supply from the circumflex coronary artery;
    - ii) the posteromedial papillary muscle has multiple heads and takes its blood supply from the right coronary artery;

**Figure 16. Mitral valve leaflet and sub-valvular apparatus.**

![](_page_18_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 17. Structural complex of the mitral valve. The annulus is formed by a ring of fibrous tissue anchoring the leaflets to the interventricular junction. This fibrous body is in direct continuity with the fibrous layer of the leaflet, which is surmounted by the spongy layer. The spongy layer is in continuity with the atrial endocardium. AV = atrioventricular.**

#### c) chordae tendineae:

- i) primary (free edge chordae) which run from the papillary muscles to the free edge of the leaflets;
- ii) secondary (strut chordae) which run from the papillary muscles to the roughened zone on the ventricular surface of each leaflet;
- iii) tertiary (basal chordae) which run from the papillary muscles or ventricular wall to the base of the leaflets;
- d) mitral valve annulus, which contracts during ventricular systole to reduce the cross-sectional area of the mitral valve orifice by 20-40%;
- e) left ventricle.

#### 19 **Describe the anatomy of the tricuspid valve (Figures 18 and 19)**

- The tricuspid valve consists of three leaflets:
  - a) anterior leaflet (largest leaflet);
  - b) septal leaflet;
  - c) posterior (mural) leaflet (smallest leaflet).
- Competency of the tricuspid valve is maintained in a similar manner to the mitral valve.
- There are two or three papillary muscles that support the tricuspid valve:
  - a) anterior papillary muscle (largest) that arises from the moderator band and supports the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve and the zone of apposition between the anterior and posterior leaflets;
  - b) medial papillary muscle (of Lancisi) that supports the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve and the zone of apposition between the septal and anterior leaflets and through which the right bundle branch passes;
  - c) posterior papillary muscle (smallest and sometimes indistinct) that supports the posterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve and the zone of apposition between the posterior and septal leaflets.

## 20 **Describe the structure of the pericardium**

- The pericardium consists of two layers:
  - a) fibrous pericardium;
  - b) serous pericardium, which itself has two layers:
    - i) visceral pericardium, which is densely adherent to the epicardium;
    - ii) parietal pericardium, which is densely adherent to the fibrous pericardium.
- The serous pericardial layers are lined by mesothelial cells which secrete and resorb pericardial fluid.
- Approximately 5-10mL of pericardial fluid lies within the pericardial space (between the visceral and parietal pericardium).

#### 21 **Describe the location of the oblique and transverse pericardial sinuses (Figure 20)**

- The oblique sinus lies posterior to the left atrium, between the four pulmonary veins and medial to the inferior vena cava.
- The transverse sinus lies behind the aorta and pulmonary trunk but in front of the superior vena cava and left atrial appendage.

![](_page_21_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 20. Sinuses of the pericardium. The pericardium has been opened through a longitudinal incision and suspended (left). After complete resection of the heart the posterior pericardium is exposed (right), demonstrating the transverse and oblique pericardial sinuses between the folding of the parietal layer of the pericardium. RPVs = right pulmonary veins; SVC = superior vena cava; IVC = inferior vena cava; RA = right atrium; PA = pulmonary artery; RV = right ventricle; LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle; RIPV = right inferior pulmonary vein; RSPV = right superior pulmonary vein; LSPV = left superior pulmonary vein; LIPV = left inferior pulmonary vein.**

#### 22 **Describe the anatomical location of the common femoral artery (Figure 21)**

- The common femoral artery is located at the mid-inguinal point, which lies halfway between the anterior superior iliac spine and the symphysis pubis.
- This needs to be distinguished from the deep inguinal ring, which lies at the mid-point of the inguinal ligament, halfway between the anterior superior iliac spine and the pubic tubercle.
- The common femoral artery is a continuation of the external iliac artery and commences just beneath the inguinal ligament.
- The common femoral artery gives off the deep femoral artery (profunda femoris) laterally and then continues as the superficial femoral artery.

![](_page_22_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 21. Anatomical relations of the common femoral artery.**

• The femoral vein lies medial to the femoral artery within the femoral sheath with the femoral nerve lying lateral to the artery but outside the femoral sheath.

## 23 **Describe the course of the common femoral vein**

- The common femoral vein can be located medial to the femoral artery (see above).
- It is formed from the confluence of the deep and superficial femoral veins just proximal to its junction with the long saphenous vein.
- The common femoral vein continues as the external iliac vein when it passes under the inguinal ligament.

#### 24 **Describe the course and landmarks of the long saphenous vein (Figure 22)**

- The long saphenous vein commences just anterior and superior to the medial malleolus.
- It continues up the medial aspect of the lower leg (with the saphenous nerve) before turning slightly posteriorly at the superior aspect of gastrocnemius.
- The vein then passes medial to the knee joint (5cm posterior to the medial aspect of the patella).
- From the knee, the vein continues up the medial aspect of the thigh to drain into the common femoral vein at the saphenofemoral junction.
- The saphenofemoral junction can be located 3cm inferior and 3cm medial to the femoral artery pulsation (mid-inguinal point).

![](_page_23_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Figure 22. Anatomical course of the long saphenous vein.**

#### 25 **Describe the course and landmarks of the short saphenous vein (Figure 23)**

- The short saphenous vein can be located 2cm posterior to the lateral malleolus.
- It courses superiorly superficial to gastrocnemius muscle in the midline of the lower leg and runs in close proximity to the sural nerve.
- It terminates by draining into the popliteal vein just below the knee.

  - b) perforating branches, which pass anteriorly and supply the overlying muscles including pectoralis major;
  - c) sternal branches;
  - d) the pericardiophrenic artery, which supplies the phrenic nerve and the lateral aspect of the pericardium.

- The left internal mammary artery terminates around the 6th intercostal space by dividing into:
  - a) the superior epigastric artery, which supplies the muscles of the superior aspect of the anterior abdominal wall, including rectus abdominis;
  - b) the musculophrenic artery, which supplies branches to the 6th-10th intercostal spaces.

## 27 **Describe the anatomy of the radial artery (Figures 25 and 26)**

- The radial artery commences as one of the two terminal branches of the brachial artery, located medial to the biceps tendon.
- It is divided into three parts:
  - a) proximal part, which lies between its origin and the distal extent of the antecubital fossa;
  - b) middle part, which extends from the antecubital fossa up to the origin of the tendons of brachioradialis, extensor carpi radialis longus and extensor carpi radialis brevis;
  - c) distal part, which runs from the origin of these tendons to the wrist crease.

  - c) distal part: flexor pollicis longus, flexor digitorum profundus and pronator quadratus.
- Its branches include the recurrent radial artery, superficial palmar artery and muscular branches.
- The radial artery terminates at the level of the radial styloid process and continues as the deep palmar artery.
- The main nerves at risk during harvesting of the radial artery include:
  - a) the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm (nerve roots C5-6), which carries sensory fibres to the lateral aspect of the forearm;

![](_page_27_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 25. Radial artery.**

![](_page_27_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 26. Anatomical course of the radial artery.**

- The phrenic nerve originates from the C3, C4 and C5 nerve roots.
- It courses down through the neck lying anterior to scalenus anterior.
- It passes posterior to the subclavian artery and medial to the internal mammary artery to lie on the lateral surface of the pericardium.
- The right phrenic nerve passes through the inferior vena caval opening of the diaphragm at the level of T8, whereas the left phrenic nerve pierces the muscular part of the left hemi-diaphragm.

![](_page_28_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Figure 27. Intrapericardial course of the phrenic nerve. The pericardium has been opened with a longitudinal incision and suspended. The neurovascular bundle runs along the external surface of the fibrous pericardium.**

- The phrenic nerve terminates by branching on the inferior surface of the diaphragm.
- The phrenic nerve supplies:
  - a) motor function to the diaphragm;
  - b) sensory function to the diaphragm and anterior chest and abdominal wall.

### 29 **Describe the anatomy of the descending thoracic aorta (Figure 28)**

• The descending thoracic aorta is a direct continuation of the aortic arch and commences just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery.

![](_page_29_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Figure 28. Anatomical course of the descending thoracic aorta. RIMA = right internal mammary artery; LIMA = left internal mammary artery; RCA = right coronary artery; LMCA = left main coronary artery.**

- It terminates at the diaphragm where it passes through the aortic hiatus, with the thoracic duct and azygos vein, to continue as the abdominal aorta.
- The descending aorta lies on the posterior thoracic wall, initially to the left of the thoracic vertebrae, gradually moving medially to lie anterior to the vertebral column as it passes through the diaphragm.
- Branches of the descending thoracic aorta include:
  - a) pericardial branches;
  - b) bronchial arteries;

  - d) mediastinal branches;
  - e) intercostal arteries;
  - f) subcostal arteries;
  - g) superior phrenic arteries.

## 30 **Describe the anatomy of the axillary artery**

- The axillary artery is a direct continuation of the subclavian artery and commences at the outer edge of the 1st rib.
- It terminates at the lower border of teres major where it continues as the brachial artery.
- The axillary artery lies within the axillary sheath, with the axillary vein and the brachial plexus, and is divided into three parts by pectoralis major with the 1st part above, 2nd part behind and 3rd part below the muscle.
- Branches of the axillary artery include the:
  - a) highest thoracic artery;
  - b) thoraco-acromial artery;
  - c) subscapular artery;
  - d) lateral thoracic artery;
  - e) anterior humeral circumflex artery;
  - f) posterior humeral circumflex artery.

## 31 **How is the heart formed embryologically?**

- The heart tube forms from fusion of the two ventral aortae which originate from the mesodermal layer of the yolk sac.
- Following longitudinal growth and rotation of the heart tube, it divides into three regions: conus truncus, sinus venosus and bulbus cordis.
- Endocardial cushions form the partition between atria and ventricles within the heart tube to create atrioventricular canals and eventually the mitral and tricuspid valves.

- The atrial septum forms from the septum primum and septum secundum, leaving a small opening, the foramen ovale.
