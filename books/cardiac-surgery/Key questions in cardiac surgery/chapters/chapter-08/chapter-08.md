## Cardiopulmonary bypass

#### What are the aims of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)?

- The principal aim of cardiopulmonary bypass is to facilitate cardiac and thoracic aortic procedures by excluding the heart and lungs from the circulation, whilst providing:
  - a) adequate gas exchange;
  - b) systemic organ perfusion;
  - c) a means of controlling body temperature;
  - d) salvage and safe re-transfusion of blood from the surgical field.
- As well as for cardiac surgical procedures, cardiopulmonary bypass is also used for:
  - a) pulmonary embolectomy;
  - b) resection of certain hepatic lesions, intracranial masses and abdominal tumours with cavo-atrial spread.

## 2 Describe a cardiopulmonary bypass circuit (Figure 1)

- Venous cannula in the right atrium, inferior and superior venae cavae or the femoral vein.
- Venous line usually ½-inch heparin-coated tubing.
- Venous reservoir usually a rigid high capacitance reservoir.
- Centrifugal or roller pump.
- Heat exchanger.
- Oxygenator usually a hollow-fibre membrane oxygenator.
- Arterial filter and bubble trap.
- Arterial line usually 3/8-inch heparin-coated tubing.
- Arterial cannula usually in the ascending aorta, femoral artery or axillary artery.
- Most bypass circuits come as sterile, pre-prepared packs, where dry and wet assembly take about 10 to 15 minutes each and the circuits can be kept on standby for up to 8 hours (wet) or 7 days (dry).

## 3 **Describe the principles of venous drainage (Figure 2)**

- There are several different methods of achieving venous drainage from the right atrium:
  - a) Ross basket, which is a perforated metal basket that lies within the right atrium, thereby avoiding any contact and potential damage with the inferior vena cava;
  - b) two-stage single venous cannula (34-42Fr), which is placed via the right atrial appendage and is thought to provide better venous drainage than the Ross basket, as it has openings that lie within the inferior vena cava and the body of the right atrium;
  - c) bicaval cannulation (24-32Fr in the superior vena cava and 28- 36Fr in the inferior vena cava), either via the right atrium or directly into the cavae, with snares around the cannulas. It prevents kinking of the superior vena cava and air entrainment

- during mitral and tricuspid valve surgery, if a single two-stage cannula alone were used;
- d) femoral venous cannula, which is placed into the right atrium under transoesophageal guidance and commonly used for minimal access cardiac surgery.

C) Bicaval venous drainage with cannulae passing via the right atrium. D) Bicaval venous drainage with cannulae placed directly into the inferior and superior venae cavae. E) Femoral venous cannula with drainage holes in the inferior vena cava, right atrium and superior vena cava.**

- Blood leaves the right atrium using the siphon effect by gravity as the venous reservoir is 40-70cm below the level of the heart.
- The rate at which blood drains from the right atrium is determined by the:
  - a) central venous pressure;
  - b) height differential between the right atrium and the venous reservoir;
  - c) resistance in the bypass circuit (cannulae, tubing and connectors) between the right atrium and the reservoir;
  - d) absence or presence of air within the tubing.
- Venous 'chattering' is usually caused by inadequate circulating volume or an excessive siphon effect, where the venous drainage is occurring at a rate faster than the return of blood to the right atrium. It is treated by adding volume to the circuit, reducing the height differential between the right atrium and the venous reservoir or partially clamping the venous line.
- Caval snares should be released when delivering antegrade cardioplegia to ensure adequate drainage of the coronary sinus return into the right atrium.
- Complications of venous cannulation include atrial arrhythmias, atrial or caval tears and subsequent bleeding, air embolisation, catheter malposition and unexpected decannulation.

#### 4 **Describe the tubing used in cardiopulmonary bypass circuits**

- Medical grade polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubing of varying diameters is usually used as it is:
  - a) flexible but resistant to kinking and collapse;
  - b) non-toxic and compatible with blood;
  - c) smooth, transparent and non-wettable;
  - d) suitable for heat sterilisation.
- Although the tubing is heparin-bonded to reduce the inflammatory response, systemic heparinisation is still required.
- The tubing is usually connected by fluted polycarbonate connectors.
- Flow dynamics can be optimised by using wide tubing with minimal areas of turbulence. This, however, has to be balanced with the need to reduce the prime volume which is achieved with a short circuit with narrow tubing.

## 5 **Describe the principles of venous reservoirs (Figure 3)**

- The venous reservoir acts as:
  - a) a high capacitance chamber for receiving venous return;
  - b) a venous bubble trap;
  - c) access to add drugs, fluids, or blood;
  - d) storage for the circulating volume during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.
- There are two main types of venous reservoir:
  - a) open reservoirs (rigid, hard plastic canisters), which have a large capacity for storage of circulating volume, allow vacuumassisted venous drainage, are easier to prime, are less expensive, can incorporate filters and allow for volume measurements and management of venous air;

![](_page_4_Picture_10.jpeg)

**Figure 3. Venous reservoirs. A) Open hard reservoir. B) Closed soft reservoir.**

b) closed reservoirs (collapsible, soft plastic bags), which are less versatile but by eliminating the blood-gas interface, are able to reduce the systemic inflammatory response and the risk of producing gas micro-emboli.

## 6 **What are the different oxygenators available (Figure 4)?**

- There are two different types of oxygenators available for use with cardiopulmonary bypass circuits:
  - a) membrane oxygenators, which contain sheaves of hollow fibres (120-200µm) with 0.3-0.8µm pores. They are thought to produce less particulate and gaseous micro-emboli, are less reactive to blood elements, and allow superior control of blood gases;

![](_page_5_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Figure 4. Combined membrane oxygenator and heat exchanger unit. Venous blood flows into the unit via the lower port. As the blood ascends, circulating water within the heat exchanger allows the temperature of the blood to be controlled. It is then oxygenated by the membrane gas exchanger, using oxygen that is infused from the upper gas port. Oxygenated blood, which has been warmed or cooled, then exits via the side port as arterial return or to be mixed with cardioplegia.** *Reproduced with permission from Eurosets Medical Devices.*

- b) bubble oxygenators, which although are cheaper, produce more gaseous micro-emboli and therefore are rarely used in the Western World.
- The oxygenator also contains a flow regulator, flow meter, gas blender, oxygen analyzer, gas filter and moisture trap.
- The arterial PaCO2 is controlled by gas flow, and PaO2 by the FiO2.

## 7 **Describe the principles of heat exchangers**

- A heat exchanger allows control of body temperature by heating and cooling blood passing through the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit.
- The heat exchanger is usually located prior to the oxygenator in the bypass circuit. This reduces the risk of producing gaseous emboli, which may occur when blood is warmed, as gases are less soluble at a higher temperature.
- The warming gradient, between the inflowing water and blood, is limited to 5°C-10°C to reduce the risk of bubble emboli.
- The blood is not heated above 40°C to reduce the risk of plasma protein denaturation.
- Blood can be cooled at approximately 1°C per minute and rewarmed at approximately 0.5°C per minute. The temperature changes more rapidly initially followed by a slower change in temperature, due to the exponential nature of the heating and cooling curves.
- Heat exchanger failure is very uncommon but may result in leakage of water into the bloodstream and subsequent haemolysis and haemoglobinuria.

#### 8 **What are the different cardiopulmonary bypass pumps available (Figure 5)?**

- Roller pumps produce flow by compression of the heparin-coated bypass tubing using two rollers 180° apart. The flow rate is determined by the:
  - a) rate of rotation of the rollers;
  - b) degree of compression;
  - c) length and diameter of the tubing being compressed.
- Centrifugal pumps produce flow by using a rotating impeller. The flow rate is determined by the:
  - a) speed of rotation of the impeller;
  - b) afterload within the circuit, distal to the pump.

• Complications of cardiopulmonary bypass pumps include a runaway pump (inability to control the pump speed), flow meter damage, electrical damage and tubing rupture (with roller pumps).

#### 9 **What filters are available within the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit?**

- Arterial line filters (40µm), which are used to reduce the cerebral embolic load.
- Leucocyte depleting filters, which remove activated neutrophils and therefore may reduce the systemic inflammatory response associated with cardiopulmonary bypass.
- Ultrafiltration and modified ultrafiltration, which remove excess fluid in patients with renal impairment and can be used to increase haematocrit levels. Cytokines generated by the systemic inflammatory response are also cleared by ultrafiltration and may have a beneficial effect by limiting subsequent tissue and end-organ injury.

#### 10 **What are the sources of cerebral emboli during cardiopulmonary bypass?**

- Gas emboli sources include:
  - a) vents;
  - b) cardiotomy reservoir (especially with low volumes);
  - c) loose purse-string sutures (especially during augmented venous return);
  - d) priming procedures and intravenous fluids;
  - e) stopcocks, sampling and injection sites;
  - f) breaks in the perfusion circuit;
  - g) rapid warming of cold blood;
  - h) cavitation;
  - i) oxygenators;
  - j) heart and great vessels (following open heart surgery).
- Particulate emboli sources include:
  - a) thrombus formation or haemolysed red cells;
  - b) denatured proteins and cellular debris;
  - c) stored donor blood;
  - d) aortic atherosclerotic and calcific debris;
  - e) muscle, bone, fat, suture material, wax or glue aspirated via the cardiotomy suckers.
- These emboli can be detected by transcranial Doppler ultrasound or fluorescein retinal angiography.
- As the cerebral vessels are immediately upstream of the heart and the aortic cannulation site, the brain is at the greatest risk of microembolic injury.

### 11 **Describe the principles of arterial cannulation**

- Arterial cannulation is usually performed at the distal ascending aortic aorta.
- An epi-aortic probe should be used to detect atherosclerotic plaques, as it is more sensitive than digital palpation or transoesophageal echocardiography (which has a blind spot at the distal ascending aorta).
- Complications include bleeding, aortic tears, aortic dissection, air embolisation, atherosclerotic plaque disruption and embolisation, aortic back wall injury, and malposition of the cannula tip (towards the aortic valve, against the aortic wall, or in an arch vessel) (Figure 6).
- Alternative sites of cannulation include the aortic arch, innominate artery, subclavian artery, axillary artery, femoral artery and the left ventricular apex.

![](_page_9_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Figure 6. Complications of arterial cannulation.**

- Cannulation of the femoral artery may, however, lead to:
  - a) limb ischaemia;
  - b) damage to nearby neurovascular structures;
  - c) disruption of debris secondary to retrograde flow;
  - d) organ malperfusion due to flow through the false lumen in patients with aortic dissection;
  - e) lower cardiopulmonary bypass flow rates, secondary to smaller calibre vessels;
  - f) retroperitoneal haemorrhage;
  - g) femoral artery stenosis or thrombosis.

#### 12 **What are the sources of blood returning to the heart during cardiopulmonary bypass?**

- Right heart from the coronary sinus, Thebesian veins and venae cavae.
- Left heart from the aortic root (if aortic regurgitation is present) and the bronchial veins.
- Congenital anomalies from an atrial or ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, persistent left superior vena cava or anomalous pulmonary venous drainage.

#### 13 **Describe the principles behind venting of the heart (Figure 7)**

- When the heart is not contracting, blood returning to the heart during cardiopulmonary bypass (see above) may cause:
  - a) cardiac rewarming;
  - b) ventricular distension. This may result in myofibrillar disruption and subsequent myocardial dysfunction following release of the aortic cross-clamp.
- In view of this, venting of the left ventricle is performed using a cannula in the:
  - a) aortic root;
  - b) directly through the aortic valve;
  - c) right superior pulmonary vein;
  - d) left ventricular apex;
  - e) main pulmonary artery.

![](_page_11_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 7. Venting of the left ventricle. LVOT = left ventricular outflow tract; RSPV = right superior pulmonary vein; PA = pulmonary artery.**

#### 14 **What safety devices are present on the cardiopulmonary bypass machine and circuit?**

- Alarms with a cardiopulmonary bypass pump cut-off include:
  - a) low venous reservoir blood level;
  - b) high arterial line pressure;
  - c) macrobubble detector.
- Arterial line filter.
- Back-up electrical generator supply, arterial pump head and heatercooler device.
- One-way valved intracardiac vent lines.
- Back-up oxygen supply with filter.

## 15 **Describe the typical constituents of priming solution**

- Adult circuits require 1.5-2L of balanced electrolyte solution. Examples include:
  - a) 1000mL Hartmann's solution;
  - b) 500mL gelofusin;
  - c) 250mL (12.5-50g) mannitol, which increases postoperative diuresis and has been shown to reduce the incidence of postoperative renal dysfunction;
  - d) U heparin;
  - e) blood when the haemoglobin levels are <10g/dL.
- Before the bypass circuit is connected to the patient, the prime volume is recirculated through a micropore filter to remove any particulate debris.
- The prime volume is reduced by using as short, narrow-bore bypass tubing as possible, to decrease the haemodilution effect of the prime volume and need for blood transfusion.

#### 16 **What is the optimal haematocrit during cardiopulmonary bypass?**

- The optimal haematocrit whilst on bypass is determined by the balance between using higher levels which increase oxygen delivery versus lower levels which reduce the blood viscosity and the risk of haemolysis.
- Ideally, haematocrit levels are similar to the temperature in °C, with lower levels required as the metabolic requirements are lower and the viscosity increases with hypothermia.
- As the prime volume of standard cardiopulmonary bypass circuits is approximately one third of the circulating blood volume, haemodilution occurs with a corresponding fall in the haematocrit level:

| CPB haematocrit = |                             | Blood volume |  | x pre-CPB haematocrit |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|--|-----------------------|
|                   | Blood volume + prime volume |              |  |                       |

- Oxygen delivery to the tissues during cardiopulmonary bypass can be controlled by three main factors:
  - a) haematocrit;
  - b) inspired oxygen concentration;
  - c) cardiopulmonary bypass pump flow rate.

- O2 delivery = 10 x pump flow(L/min) x [1.34 x Hb(g/dL) x SaO2 (%)] + [0.003 x PaO2(mmHg)].
- The mixed venous oxygen saturations can be used to determine whether oxygen delivery is adequate and if <60%, either blood should be transfused or pump flows increased.
- Haematocrit levels are approximately three times greater than haemoglobin levels.

#### 17 **What anticoagulation regimes are used for cardiopulmonary bypass?**

- The standard dose of heparin for cardiopulmonary bypass is 300- 400 units (3-4mg) per kg, given intravenously; 2mg/kg is utilised for minimal extracorporeal circulation (MECC).
- After minutes, the activated clotting time (ACT) is measured. Pump suckers can be turned on when the ACT is >400s and cardiopulmonary bypass initiated when the ACT is >480s.
- The ACT is measured every 30 minutes whilst on cardiopulmonary bypass and additional heparin boluses (5000-10,000 U) are given to maintain the ACT >480s.
- If the ACT fails to reach 480s, additional heparin should be given up to 500 U per kg. At this stage, antithrombin III deficiency should be considered, especially if the patient was receiving heparin preoperatively, and fresh frozen plasma or recombinant antithrombin should be administered to overcome heparin resistance.
- Antithrombin is a necessary cofactor that binds circulating thrombin and heparin accelerates this reaction a thousand-fold.
- Direct thrombin inhibitors (such as argatroban, bivalirudin) may be needed if the patient is allergic or resistant to heparin. Reversal of these agents is, however, difficult.

#### 18 **What parameters are monitored during cardiopulmonary bypass?**

- Patient parameters:
  - a) electrocardiogram (ECG);
  - b) arterial blood pressure (BP);
  - c) central venous pressure (CVP);
  - d) arterial oxygen saturations (SaO2);
  - e) end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2);
  - f) peripheral and core temperature;
  - g) urine output;
  - h) arterial blood gases including pH, PaO2, PaCO2, bicarbonate, lactate, base excess, potassium, glucose.

#### • Cardiopulmonary bypass pump parameters:

- a) blood flow rate;
- b) centrifugal or roller pump speed;
- c) arterial line pressure;
- d) arterial and venous line oxygen saturations;
- e) delivered oxygen concentration;
- f) gas flow;
- g) temperature of the pump blood;
- h) temperature of water in the heat exchanger.

#### 19 **What is the optimal flow rate on cardiopulmonary bypass?**

- Cardiopulmonary bypass flow rates are calculated to achieve a cardiac index of 2.4L/min/m2 at 37°C (hence 4.8L/min for an average patient with a BSA of 2m2).
- For each 1°C reduction in temperature, the flow rate can be reduced by 7%.
- Once the optimal flow rate has been achieved, the mean arterial pressure is maintained between 55-65mmHg with the aid of vasodilators and vasoconstrictors.
- For patients with hypertension, carotid artery stenosis and renal disease, and the elderly, the mean arterial pressure needs to be maintained at a higher level, between 65-75mmHg.

## 20 **How is body surface area calculated?**

• Body surface area (BSA) can be calculated using the formula:

BSA (m2) = ([Height(cm) x Weight(kg)] / 3600)½

#### 21 **Describe the principles of anticoagulation reversal following separation of cardiopulmonary bypass**

- Protamine is a cation (derived from salmon sperm) that binds with the anion, heparin, to form stable heparin-protamine complexes.
- Protamine contains two active sites, one for neutralising heparin and one which has mild anticoagulant effects.
- For each 1mg (100U) of heparin administered initially, 1mg of protamine (maximum 3mg/kg) should be injected intravenously to reverse the anticoagulant effect.
- Heparin rebound may occur once all of the protamine is bound by circulating heparin and further tissue heparin is released maintaining

- the anticoagulant effect. In this situation, a further dose of protamine (50mg) may be required.
- Once the protamine infusion has commenced, the pump suckers should be turned off.
- Protamine should be given as a slow infusion over 15 minutes to reduce the risk of protamine reactions (see below).

#### 22 **Describe the Horrow classification of protamine reactions**

- Class I: hypotension caused by rapid administration of protamine. This is triggered by histamine release and can usually be treated by fluid resuscitation and vasopressors.
- Class II: anaphylactic reaction:
  - a) IIa (true anaphylaxis) hypotension, bronchospasm and angioedema, mediated by anti-protamine immunogolublin E antibody, histamine, prostaglandins and kinins. It occurs in diabetics (on protamine-zinc insulin), patients with fish allergies and those who have been exposed to protamine previously. It should be treated by immediately stopping the protamine, and administering 10mL 1:100,000 IV adrenaline, 100mg IV hydrocortisone, 10mg IV chlorphenamine (Piriton®), 100% O2 and nebulised bronchodilators;
  - b) IIb (immediate anaphylactoid) and IIc (delayed anaphylactoid) reactions are similar but less severe and are mediated by the complement pathway.
- Class III: catastrophic pulmonary vasoconstriction is caused by complement activation and the release of thromboxane A2. This results in right ventricular failure, circulatory shock and severe bronchospasm. The treatment includes immediately stopping the protamine and administering 10mL 1:100,000 IV adrenaline, milrinone, and re-institution of cardiopulmonary bypass.

#### 23 **What are the complications of cardiopulmonary bypass?**

• Systemic inflammatory response induced by the contact of blood with the foreign surface of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, activating cytokine, kallikrein, coagulation and complement cascades. This often results in increased capillary permeability, interstitial oedema and subsequent organ dysfunction.

- Coagulopathy caused by platelet dysfunction, as well as dilution and consumption of coagulation factors and platelets.
- Haemolysis.
- Renal and splanchnic hypoperfusion.
- Cerebrovascular accident, caused by gas and particulate emboli (see earlier) and cerebral hypoperfusion.
- It has been suggested that membrane oxygenators, heparin-coated circuits, centrifugal pumps, intra-operative steroids and leucocyte depleting filters may reduce the systemic inflammatory response.

## 24 Describe the principles of minimal extracorporeal circulation (MECC) (Figure 8)

- In comparison to standard cardiopulmonary bypass, the principal aims of MECC are to:
  - reduce the systemic inflammatory response by removing the venous reservoir and cardiotomy suckers, thereby reducing the blood-air interface that triggers the inflammatory cascades;

![](_page_16_Figure_10.jpeg)

**Figure 8.** Minimal extracorporeal circulation (MECC) cardiopulmonary bypass circuit.  $O_2$  = oxygen.

b) minimise haemodilution associated with cardiopulmonary bypass by reducing the prime volume by retrograde and antegrade autologous priming, where the crystalloid priming solution is 'displaced' out of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit by the patient's own blood both in the arterial and venous lines just before the commencement of cardiopulmonary bypass.

#### 25 **Describe the principles of venous drainage in a patient with a persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) (Figure 9)**

• When present, a PLSVC drains blood from the left subclavian and internal jugular veins via the coronary sinus into the right atrium (90%) or directly into the left atrium (10%).

![](_page_17_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Figure 9. Persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC). Posterior view of the heart with the PLSVC draining into the coronary sinus (CS) or the left atrium (LA). LPA = left pulmonary artery; RPA = right pulmonary artery; Ao = aorta; SVC = superior vena cava; LSPV = left superior pulmonary vein; RSPV = right superior pulmonary vein; LIPV = left inferior pulmonary vein; RIPV = right inferior pulmonary vein; RA = right atrium; LV = left ventricle.**

- PLSVC occurs in 0.3-0.5% of patients and should be suspected if:
  - a) the left innominate vein is small or absent;
  - b) the coronary sinus is large;
  - c) the right superior vena cava is small or absent.
- When undertaking cardiopulmonary bypass in the presence of a PLSVC:
  - a) a single two-stage cannula can be used if the right side of the heart is not opened;
  - b) if bicaval cannulation is required and a right superior vena cava is present, then the PLSVC can be snared;
  - c) if bicaval cannulation is required and a right connecting innominate vein is absent, an additional coronary sinus cannula is required to prevent right atrial distension and congestion of the left cerebral hemishpere;
  - d) there is systemic desaturation due to right to left shunt in cases of PLSVC to LA.
