# Echocardiography

### 1 **What is echocardiography?**

- Echocardiography is a non-invasive cardiac imaging modality, which uses piezo-electric crystals that emit and receive ultrasound waves at a rate of 1000 per second.
- These crystals convert electrical oscillations into mechanical oscillations (sound).
- When the ultrasound waves reach an interface between two different mediums, part of the ultrasound wave is reflected back towards the probe. The echocardiogram can measure two entities:
  - a) the distance from the probe, which is calculated by the time delay between the transmission and reception of the reflected sound wave;
  - b) the density of the tissue, which is calculated by the intensity of the reflected signal.
- Echocardiography is usually carried out with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position, using a 2.25MHz probe in adults and a 5MHz probe in children.
- The quality of the echocardiography images is affected by the structures between the heart and the probe. Hence, poor images are obtained in patients with lung disease, obesity and chest wall deformities.

### 2 **What is Doppler echocardiography?**

- Doppler echocardiography uses the principles of the Doppler effect, where the relative velocity and direction of a sound source to the observer determines the received frequency of the sound.
- The Doppler probe acts as the transmitter (usually 2MHz) and receiver of the ultrasound waves.

- If blood moves towards the Doppler probe the received frequency of ultrasound wave increases and if blood moves away from the probe the frequency decreases.
- Doppler echocardiography images plot velocity against time, with flows above the line representing blood moving towards the probe and below the line for blood moving away from the probe (Figure 1).
- There is also a densitometric dimension of the image as turbulent flow has a wide range of velocities, and is represented by the Doppler flow signal 'filled in' compared to normal laminar flow which has all the blood cells travelling at similar velocity, represented as a single line on the Doppler flow signal.

**Figure 1. Doppler echocardiography with flow towards the probe (across the mitral valve) above the line and flow away from the probe (across the aortic valve) below the line.**

### 3 **What is aliasing?**

- Aliasing refers to the phenomenon when the Nyquist limit of maximum velocity is exceeded, resulting in 'wrapping around' of the Doppler signal and an abnormally low velocity (Figure 2).
- Aliasing only occurs with pulsed-wave Doppler. In view of this, high velocity jets need to be assessed using continuous-wave Doppler, where aliasing does not occur.

**Figure 2. Aliasing.**

### 4 What are the different modes of echocardiography?

- M (motion) mode uses a single beam of ultrasound and produces a one-dimensional moving image of the heart (Figure 3).
- 2D echocardiography cross-sectional imaging (see below).
- 3D echocardiography.
- Doppler echocardiography (see below).

**Figure 3.** M-mode echocardiography. IVS = interventricular septum; RV = right ventricle; LV = left ventricle; MV = mitral valve.

#### 5 What are the standard 2D echocardiography views?

- Parasternal long axis view, where the probe is placed at the left sternal edge in the second to fourth intercostal space with the probe marker pointing towards the right shoulder (Figure 4).
- Parasternal short axis view, where the probe is placed at the left sternal edge in the second to fourth intercostal space with the probe marker pointing towards the left shoulder. Images are taken at the level of the aortic valve, mitral valve leaflet tips, papillary muscles and apex (Figure 5A-D).

- Apical four-chamber view, where the probe marker is pointing towards the left shoulder (Figure 6).
- Apical five-chamber view, where the probe is angulated anteriorly from the four-chamber view (Figure 7).

**Figure 7. Apical 5-chamber view. RV = right ventricle; RA = right atrium; LV = left ventricle; LA = left atrium; Ao = ascending aorta.**

- Apical long axis two-chamber view (Figure 8).
- Subcostal view, where the probe is placed just below the xiphoid process (Figure 9).

- Suprasternal view, where the probe is placed in the suprasternal notch.
- Right parasternal view, where the probe is placed at the right sternal edge in the second to fourth intercostal space.

### 6 **What are the different modes of Doppler echocardiography?**

• Continuous-wave Doppler, where the transmitter continuously emits ultrasound waves, thereby allowing the probe to measure high velocities. It is, however, unable to localise the signal, as it can originate from any point along the ultrasound beam (Figure 10).

![](_page_7_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Figure 10. Continuous-wave Doppler.**

- Pulsed-wave Doppler, which allows the flow to be localised or sampled from a small region but is only useful for velocities up to 2m/s, otherwise it may result in aliasing (see earlier) (Figure 11).
- Colour-flow mapping Doppler, which uses colour-encoded pulsedwave Doppler superimposed over the 2D echo image, demonstrating blood velocity and the direction of flow (Figure 12):
  - a) blue colour represents flow away from the probe, whilst red colour represents flow towards the probe (BART);

![](_page_8_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 11. Pulsed-wave Doppler.**

![](_page_8_Figure_4.jpeg)

**Figure 12. Colour-flow Doppler.**

- b) as flow velocities increase, the colour becomes progressively lighter;
- c) as colour-flow mapping uses pulsed-wave Doppler, colour reversal (aliasing) occurs at higher velocities.

### 7 **What are the normal echocardiographic cardiac chamber sizes and function?**

• The normal dimensions are influenced by age, sex, height and physical training (athletes)(Table 1).

# 9 How is left ventricular function assessed echocardiographically?

- Regional wall motion abnormality:
  - a) normal;
  - b) hypokinetic (decreased motion);
  - c) akinetic (absent movement);
  - d) dyskinetic (paradoxical movement):
  - e) aneurysmal.
- Global left ventricular function is assessed visually as good, moderate or poor.
- Ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) can be calculated using the formulae:

EF (%) = 
$$100 \times (LVIDd^3 - LVIDs^3) / LVIDd^3$$
  
FS (%) =  $100 \times (LVIDd - LVIDs) / LVIDd$ 

where LVIDd = left ventricular internal diameter in diastole, LVIDs = left ventricular internal diameter in systole.

• The left ventricular cavity and wall measurements are taken with M-mode echocardiography from the parasternal long axis view with the beam through the tips of the mitral valve leaflets at end-diastole (R wave) and end-systole (T wave) (Figure 13).

![](_page_10_Figure_14.jpeg)

**Figure 13.** Left ventricular cavity and wall measurements in diastole and systole. IVSd/IVSs = interventricular septal thickness in diastole/systole; LVIDd/LVIDs = left ventricular internal diameter in diastole/systole; LVPWd/LVPWs = left ventricular posterior wall thickness in diastole/systole.

• The ejection fraction can also be calculated by Simpson's method, where the left ventricle is divided into multiple slices of known thickness and diameter along the short axis. The left ventricular volume can then be calculated by the sum total of the volume of each slice (area x thickness = p(D/2)2 x T) in systole and diastole. Ejection fraction and cardiac output can then be calculated using the formulae:

Ejection fraction (%) = 100 x (LVEDV - LVESV) / LVEDV Stroke volume = LVEDV - LVESV Cardiac output = stroke volume x heart rate

where D = diameter of left ventricle cavity in each slice, T = thickness of each slice, LVEDV = left ventricular end-diastolic volume, LVESV = left ventricular end-systolic volume.

### 10 **How are pressure gradients across a valve calculated (Figure 14)?**

• Using the modified Bernoulli equation, two different pressure gradients can be calculated across a cardiac valve:

$$\Delta P = 4v^2$$

where DP = change in pressure (mmHg), v = velocity (m/sec).

- a) peak gradient, which is calculated from the peak velocity;
- b) mean gradient, which is calculated from the mean velocity (i.e. velocity time integral).
- These Doppler-calculated gradients represent actual instantaneous physiological gradients. The peak-to-peak gradient which is calculated at cardiac catheterisation is measured by the withdrawal of the catheter from the left ventricle to the aorta. The peak gradient across the aortic valve, the peak left ventricular pressure and peak aortic pressure, however, do not occur at the same time.
- The main limitations of Doppler-calculated gradients are:
  - a) using the modified Bernoulli equation to calculate gradients from measured velocities is governed by a number of assumptions including that of linear flow. Valvular stenosis, however, produces turbulent flow;
  - b) the ultrasound beam must be parallel to the direction of blood flow, otherwise the peak velocity and, hence, peak gradient will

![](_page_12_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 14.** Mean and peak pressure gradient calculated by Doppler in comparison to peak-to-peak gradient calculated by cardiac catheterisation. LV = left ventricle.

be underestimated and this can be a problem with the eccentric flow of aortic stenosis.

### What is the continuity equation?

- The continuity equation is based on the principle of conservation of mass, hence the flow of blood across the outflow tract of a chamber must be the same as the flow of blood across the valve of that chamber (Figure 15).
- Volume of blood flow = cross-sectional area (A) x velocity of blood (V).
- Hence, as regards the aortic valve:

Blood flow across the aortic valve = Blood flow across the left ventricular outflow tract

$$\begin{aligned} & \text{Area}_{\text{AoV}} \text{ x VTI}_{\text{AoV}} = \text{Area}_{\text{LVOT}} \text{ x VTI}_{\text{LVOT}} \\ & \text{Area}_{\text{AoV}} = \underbrace{\frac{\text{Area}_{\text{LVOT}} \text{ x VTI}_{\text{LVOT}}}{\text{VTI}_{\text{AoV}}} \end{aligned}$$

where LVOT = left ventricular outflow tract, VTI = velocity time integral, AoV = aortic valve.

• If the peak velocity across the aortic valve is <2m/s, the continuity equation is not accurate.

![](_page_13_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Figure 15. Continuity equation demonstrating that the total flow (area x velocity) of blood that passes through the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) is the same as the total flow of blood passing through the aortic valve. A1 = LVOT area; V1 = LVOT flow velocity; A2 = aortic valve area; V2 = intra-aortic flow velocity; RV = right ventricle; LV = left ventricle; LA = left atrium; Ao = ascending aorta.**

## 12 **What is the aortic dimensionless index?**

- Dimensionless index = VTI LVOT VTI AoV
- Normal = 1, severe aortic stenosis <0.25.

### 13 **How is valvular stenosis quantified on echocardiography?**

- Valvular stenosis can be quantified using the following:
  - a) peak velocity across the valve;
  - b) peak gradient across the valve;
  - c) mean gradient across the valve;
  - d) valve area, which can be calculated by:
    - i) planimetry direct measurement of the valve in the short axis view (Figure 16);

![](_page_14_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 16. Measurement of aortic valve area by planimetry on the short axis view.**

- ii) continuity equation applicable to both the aortic and mitral valves.
- Additional techniques used for measuring aortic stenosis include (see Chapter 12):
  - a) dimensionless index = VTI LVOT (see above); VTI AoV
  - b) maximal aortic cusp separation (MACS), which is measured using M-mode echocardiography with the cursor across the aortic valve leaflet tips. Normal MACS is >2cm and severe aortic stenosis is <0.8cm (Figure 17).
- Additional techniques used to aid quantification of mitral stenosis include (see Chapter 13):
  - a) the pressure half-time, where the:

mitral valve area (cm<sup>2</sup>) = 
$$\frac{220}{\text{pressure half-time (ms)}}$$
 (see below);

- b) pulmonary artery systolic pressure (see below).
- It is also important to assess the aetiology of the valvular stenosis, valve morphology, degree of leaflet movement, changes in left ventricular and left atrial function and size, and the presence of other valvular lesions.

![](_page_15_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 17. Maximal aortic cusp separation demonstrating: A) normal aortic valve; and B) severe aortic stenosis.**

### 14 **How is pulmonary artery systolic pressure measured by echocardiography (Figure 18)?**

- Most normal hearts have a small degree of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) present.
- Using the modified Bernoulli equation for the pressure gradient across the tricuspid valve:

$$RVSP - RAP = 4 v^2$$

where v = peak velocity across tricuspid valve, RVSP = right ventricular systolic pressure, RAP = right atrial pressure (normally 0- 10mmHg) = JVP (jugular venous pressure).

![](_page_16_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 18. Measurement of pulmonary artery systolic pressure. Using the small degree of tricuspid regurgitation present in most normal hearts, the right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) can be calculated. If no pulmonary stenosis is present, the RVSP also represents the pulmonary artery systolic pressure. RA = right atrium.**

- Hence RVSP = 4 v2 + JVP.
- Assuming there is no pulmonary stenosis, RVSP also represents the pulmonary artery systolic pressure (normally <25mmHg).
- If no TR is present, the pulmonary artery pressures cannot be calculated using this method.

### 15 **How is valvular regurgitation quantified on echocardiography?**

- Jet size colour-flow mapping (see below).
- Vena contracta width (width of the narrowest part of the regurgitant jet).
- Proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) or proximal isosurface acceleration to calculate:
  - a) regurgitant volume;
  - b) regurgitant fraction;
  - c) effective regurgitant orifice area.

### • Flow reversal:

- a) systolic flow reversal in the pulmonary veins for mitral regurgitation;
- b) diastolic flow reversal in the descending aorta for aortic regurgitation.
- Additional techniques used for measuring aortic regurgitation include (Figure 19):
  - a) deceleration rate with severe aortic regurgitation >3m/s2;
  - b) pressure half-time with severe aortic regurgitation <300ms.

![](_page_17_Figure_8.jpeg)

**Figure 19. Deceleration rate and pressure half-time measurements to quantify the severity of aortic regurgitation.**

• It is also important to assess for the aetiology of the valvular regurgitation, valve morphology, degree of leaflet movement, changes in left ventricular and left atrial function and size, and the presence of other valvular lesions.

### 16 **How is valvular regurgitation quantified on colour-flow Doppler (Figure 20 and Table 3)?**

![](_page_18_Picture_3.jpeg)

### 17 **What is the vena contracta (Figure 21)?**

• The vena contracta is defined as the narrowest segment of regurgitant flow stream and typically occurs just beyond the regurgitant orifice.

![](_page_19_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 21. Vena contracta.**

### 18 **What is the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) (Figure 22)?**

![](_page_19_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Figure 22. Proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA).**

- PISA is based on the haemodynamic principles of flow converging on an orifice in hemispheric layers of equal velocity.
- The effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) can be calculated by measuring the surface area of the converging hemisphere.
- The regurgitant volume can be calculated by multiplying the EROA by the flow velocity.

### 19 **What are the components of the mitral valve inflow pattern?**

- Using pulsed-wave Doppler:
  - a) the E (early) wave represents the rapid early diastolic left ventricular filling phase;
  - b) the A (atrial) wave represents the late diastolic left ventricular filling phase, associated with left atrial contraction and, hence, is lost in patients with atrial fibrillation;
  - c) the acceleration time (AT) occurs from the onset of mitral diastolic flow to the peak of the E wave;
  - d) the deceleration time (DT) occurs from the peak of the E wave to the end of early mitral flow (Figure 23).
- The normal EA ratio is.
- Abnormal EA ratios occur in patients with diastolic dysfunction (see below), restrictive cardiomyopathy and constrictive pericarditis.

![](_page_20_Figure_13.jpeg)

**Figure 23. Mitral valve inflow pattern.**

# 20 What are the characteristics of diastolic dysfunction found on echocardiography (Figure 24)?

- Diastolic dysfunction is characterised by increased chamber stiffness and impaired relaxation following ventricular contraction resulting in impaired diastolic flow from the left atrium to ventricle due to increased resistance to flow.
- There are four echocardiographic grades of diastolic dysfunction:
  - a) Grade I abnormal relaxation (E<A);
  - b) Grade II pseudonormal filling (E>A);
  - c) Grade III reversible restrictive filling (E>>A);
  - d) Grade IV fixed restrictive filling (E>>>A).

![](_page_21_Figure_9.jpeg)

**Figure 24.** Grades I - III of diastolic dysfunction demonstrated on mitral valve inflow (MVF) patterns and tissue Doppler indices (TDI). ECG = electrocardiogram; E = E wave; A = A wave; Mo = opening of the mitral valve; Mc = closing of the mitral valve.

# 21 How is the pressure half-time (PHT) determined to calculate the area of the mitral valve (Figure 25)?

- The angle of the slope of the E wave on the mitral valve inflow pattern represents the rate at which the left atrial and left ventricular pressures equalise following opening of the mitral valve.
- In mitral stenosis, the rate of decline of pressure equalisation is slower and this is represented on the E wave slope as a more shallow angle.

![](_page_22_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 25. Mitral valve area measurement using pressure halftime. P½t = pressure half-time.**

• This phenomenon can be quantified using pressure half-time (PHT) measurements allowing the mitral valve area (MVA) to be calculated indirectly:

$$MVA (cm^2) = \frac{220}{PHT (msec)}$$

• As the graph actually depicts change in velocity, the PHT is actually when velocity falls to 0.7 of its peak value (calculated by the Bernoulli equation):

velocity is proportional to the square root of pressure (0.7 = Ö0.5).

- 22 **How is a pericardial effusion differentiated from a pleural effusion on echocardiography (Figure 26)?**
- In comparison to pleural effusions, pericardial effusions:
  - a) terminate at the atrioventricular groove;
  - b) do not extend beyond the level of the descending aorta.

![](_page_23_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 26. Differentiating a pericardial effusion from a pleural effusion on echocardiography.**

### 23 **What are the echocardiographic characteristics of left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure 27)?**

• Left ventricular hypertrophy is defined as a left ventricular mass index >136g/m2 in men and >112g/m2 in women.

![](_page_23_Figure_6.jpeg)

**Figure 27. Left ventricular hypertrophy. IVSd = inter-ventricular septal thickness in diastole; LVIDd/LVIDs = left ventricular internal diameter in diastole/systole; LVPWd = left ventricular posterior wall thickness in diastole.**

• The left ventricular mass index can be calculated using a series of formulae:

LVM (g) = 1.04 [(LVIDd + IVSd + LVPWd)3 - LVIDd3] - 14 BSA (m2) = [height (cm) x weight (kg) / 3600] ½ LVMI (g/m2) = LVM / BSA

where LVM = left ventricular mass, LVIDd = left ventricular internal diameter in diastole, IVSd = interventricular septal thickness in diastole, LVPWd = left ventricular posterior wall thickness in diastole, BSA = body surface area, LVMI = left ventricular mass index.

• Asymmetrical septal hypertrophy is defined as an IVSd: LVPWd ratio >1.5 and occurs more commonly in elderly women and in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Figure 28).

![](_page_24_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Figure 28. Asymmetrical septal hypertrophy. IVS = interventricular septum; RV = right ventricle; LVPW = left ventricular posterior wall; LV = left ventricle; LVOT = left ventricular outflow tract; LA = left atrium; Ao = ascending aorta.**

### 24 **How is the aortic valve assessed on echocardiography?**

- 2D echocardiography:
  - a) aortic valve leaflets motion (normal, excessive, restricted), thickening, calcification, bicuspid aortic valve, planimetry for aortic valve area, vegetation;

b) aortic root - dilation, dissection, abscess.

### • M-mode:

a) cardiac function and size - left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular dilation, left ventricular dysfunction.

### • Doppler echocardiography:

- a) colour-flow Doppler jet width, vena contracta, regurgitant fraction, regurgitant volume, effective regurgitant orifice area;
- b) pulsed-wave Doppler descending aorta diastolic flow reversal;
- c) continuous-wave Doppler peak velocity, peak pressure gradient, mean pressure gradient, pressure half-time, continuity equation.

### 25 **How is the mitral valve assessed on echocardiography?**

- 2D echocardiography:
  - a) mitral valve leaflets and subvalvar apparatus motion (normal, excessive, restricted), thickening, calcification, planimetry for mitral valve area, vegetations, flail segment, chordal elongation, papillary muscle dysfunction and left atrial thrombus.

### • M-mode:

a) cardiac function and size - left ventricular dilation, left ventricular dysfunction, left atrial dilation.

### • Doppler echocardiography:

- a) colour-flow Doppler jet width, vena contracta, regurgitant fraction, regurgitant volume, effective regurgitant orifice area;
- b) pulsed-wave Doppler pulmonary vein flow reversal, mean pressure gradient, pressure half-time, pulmonary artery systolic pressure.

# 26 What are the characteristics of pericardial tamponade on echocardiography (Figure 29)?

- Large-volume pericardial effusion.
- Right atrial and ventricular diastolic collapse.
- Exaggerated respiratory variations in transmitral and transtricuspid flows, normally seen in inspiration and expiration.

**Figure 29.** Pericardial tamponade, demonstrated by: A) large pericardial effusion and right ventricular collapse on an apical 4-chamber view; and B) marked respiratory transmitral inflow variation.

### 27 **What are the characteristics of constrictive pericarditis on echocardiography (Figure 30)?**

- Thickened and calcified echobright pericardium.
- Abrupt cessation of left ventricular filling in early diastole (due to a non-compliant pericardium) resulting in a septal bounce pattern.
- Posterior left ventricular wall flattening during late diastole (due to a non-compliant pericardium restricting diastolic filling).
- Dilated superior and inferior venae cavae and hepatic veins due to raised systemic venous pressures.
- Abnormal mitral inflow pattern reflecting left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
- Exaggerated respiratory variation of the mitral and tricuspid valve inflow patterns, with >25% increase in transtricuspid and >25% decrease in transmitral flow during inspiration.

C) M-mode echocardiography demonstrating grade I diastolic dysfunction with E:A reversal on the mitral valve inflow pattern.**

# 28 What are the characteristics of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy on echocardiography?

- Asymmetrical septal hypertrophy (ASH) with an IVSd: LVPWd ratio >1.5.
- Systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve, which may result in mitral regurgitation.
- Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO).
- Mid-systolic fluttering or closure of the aortic valve.
- Diastolic dysfunction.

# 29 What are the characteristics of restrictive cardiomyopathy on echocardiography?

- Diastolic dysfunction.
- Systolic dysfunction.
- Concentric thickening of the posterior wall and interventricular septum.
- Reduced left and right ventricular cavity dimensions.
- Reduced septal wall motion.
- Endomyocardial fibrosis may also be present resulting in cavity obliteration and an echobright endocardium.

# 30 What are the important features to assess on echocardiography in patients with coronary artery disease?

- Global left ventricular systolic function.
- Regional wall motion abnormalities (attributable to coronary artery territories).
- Complications of myocardial infarction ventricular septal rupture, papillary muscle rupture, left ventricular free wall aneurysm or rupture.
- Ischaemic mitral regurgitation.
- Associated valvular disease.
- Pericardial effusion.
- Left ventricular thrombus.

# 31 What are the characteristics of an atrial myxoma on echocardiography (Figure 31)?

 Atrial myxomas usually present as a heterogenous mass often with cystic areas and areas of calcification.

**148 Figure 31. Echocardiographic features of a left atrial myxoma. IAS = interatrial septum; MV = mitral valve; LV = left ventricle.**

• These tumours are often mobile with a stalk attached to the intraatrial septum and may be visualised prolapsing into the left ventricle.

#### 32 **What are the main indications for stress echocardiography?**

- Viability studies in the presence of hibernating myocardium (see Chapter 7).
- Low-flow low-gradient aortic stenosis (see Chapter 12).
- Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction to determine the need for intervention (resting gradient >30mmHg, stress-induced gradient >100mmHg).
- Stress can be induced by:
  - a) exercise;
  - b) pacing;
  - c) pharmacology (dobutamine or adenosine).

### 33 **What are the main indications for transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE)?**

- Ascending aortic dissection, with a specificity approaching 100% and a sensitivity of 98%. There is, however, a blind spot at the distal ascending aorta.
- Mitral valve regurgitation, to further delineate the aetiology of the regurgitation.
- Infective endocarditis, especially with prosthetic valves and to identify peri-annular abscesses.
- Intra-operatively to assess:
  - a) the success of aortic or mitral valve repair;
  - b) de-airing following an open heart procedure;
  - c) left ventricular function.
- Intracardiac masses including tumours and thrombus.
- Atrial and ventricular septal defects.

## 34 **What are the contra-indications to TOE?**

- Oesophageal disease including neoplasia, varices, webs and fistulae.
- Upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
- Severe cervical arthritis or instability.
