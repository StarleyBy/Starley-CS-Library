### Cardiac catheterisation

#### 1 **What is coronary angiography?**

• Coronary angiography is an invasive cardiological investigation where radio-opaque dye is injected through the coronary ostia to delineate coronary artery anatomy using multiple 2D cine images.

#### 2 **How is coronary angiography performed?**

- The patient is kept fasted for 4 hours prior to the procedure and given a premedication, including a benzodiazepine and an opiate.
- The patient is placed supine on a radiolucent mobile screening table.
- Access to the aortic root is gained via the femoral, brachial, radial or ulnar artery by placing an arterial sheath using a percutaneous modified Seldinger technique.
- The coronary ostia are engaged with a variety of pre-formed catheters (such as a Judkins left or Judkins right) and non-ionic radioopaque dye is injected into the left and right coronary arteries under fluoroscopic guidance.
- As a 6Fr (2mm) catheter is often used, it is possible to judge the size of the vessels relative to the catheter.
- As well as the coronary arteries, the left ventricle, mitral valve, aortic valve and ascending aorta can all be assessed during the same procedure.
- The different views obtained of the coronary arteries are described by the position of the X-ray detector:
  - a) right anterior oblique (RAO);
  - b) left anterior oblique (LAO);
  - c) anteroposterior (AP).

These views will have different degrees of associated cranial and caudal tilt.

• On completion of the procedure, the arterial sheath is removed and haemostasis can be achieved using a collagen plug (AngioSeal®).

- What are the standard views of the left coronary system during coronary angiography (Figures 1-5)?
- RAO 20° caudal 20°.
- AP 0° caudal 30°.
- AP 0° cranial 40°.
- LAO 50° cranial 30°.
- LAO 50° caudal 30° ('spider' view).
- On the RAO view, the ribs descend down to the right side of the image with the thoracic spine on the left side of the image.
- On the LAO view, the ribs descend down to the left side of the image with the thoracic spine on the right side of the image.
- The left anterior descending artery descends towards the apex. It is usually the longest vessel and has septal arteries branching off at 90°.
- The circumflex artery is the closest artery to the thoracic spine and the descending aorta.
- If the procedure has been performed via the femoral route, the catheter will be visible in the descending aorta, close to the thoracic spine.

Figure 11. Coronary artery lesions: A) discrete concentric lesion; B) discrete eccentric lesion; C) saphenous vein graft lesion; D) bifurcation lesion; E) tapering lesion; F) aneurysm containing thrombus.

- Left main stem.
- Left anterior descending (LAD) artery system LAD artery, diagonal arteries, septal arteries.
- Circumflex coronary artery system atrioventricular circumflex artery, obtuse marginal arteries, intermediate artery.

- Right coronary artery (RCA) system RCA, posterior descending artery, posterior left ventricular branch.
- Coronary artery dominance.
- Retrograde filling of occluded vessels.
- Global left ventricular function with regional wall motion abnormalities.
- Mitral valve regurgitation, annular calcification.
- Aortic valve regurgitation, calcification, dilated aortic root.

#### 10 How is mitral regurgitation classified by angiography?

- According to the Sellers' classification (Figure 12):
  - a) I: incomplete opacification of the left atrium that clears with each beat;
  - b) II: complete opacification of the left atrium that does not clear with each beat;
  - c) III: complete opacification of the left atrium with a similar density to the left ventricle;
  - d) IV: complete opacification of the left atrium in one beat, that becomes progressively more dense with each beat, with contrast refluxing into the pulmonary veins.

**Figure 12.** Sellers' grade IV mitral regurgitation. LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle.

#### 11 **How is aortic regurgitation classified by angiography (Figure 13)?**

- According to the Sellers' classification:
  - a) 1+: small regurgitant jet across the aortic valve but without opacification of the left ventricle;
  - b) 2+: regurgitant jet across the aortic valve with faint opacification of the left ventricle;
  - c) 3+: dense opacification of the left ventricle with no distinct jet across the aortic valve usually visualized;
  - d) 4+: opacification of the left ventricle greater than the aorta.

**Figure 13. Sellers' angiographic classification of aortic regurgitation.**

#### 12 **How is left ventricular function classified by ventriculography?**

- Global left ventricular function:
  - a) good: >50% left ventricular ejection fraction;
  - b) moderate: 30-50% left ventricular ejection fraction;
  - c) poor: <30% left ventricular ejection fraction.
- Regional wall motion abnormalities based on five areas of the left ventricle on the RAO view (anterobasal, apex, anterior, inferior, inferobasal) and three areas on the LAO view (lateral, septal, inferior):
  - a) normal;
  - b) hypokinetic;
  - c) akinetic;
  - d) dyskinetic;
  - e) aneurysmal.

#### 13 **What is a significant stenosis of a coronary artery (Figure 14)?**

![](_page_10_Figure_14.jpeg)

**Figure 14. Coronary artery stenosis as classified by luminal diameter and cross-sectional area.**

• The correlation between luminal stenosis and cross-sectional area (CSA) stenosis is governed by the formula:

area = pr2 (where r = radius of vessel, p = 3.14) hence:

- a) 50% luminal diameter reduction = 75% CSA reduction;
- b) 70% luminal diameter reduction = 91% CSA reduction;
- c) 90% luminal diameter reduction = 99% CSA reduction.
- Significant stenosis is defined as >60% luminal diameter (84% CSA reduction).
- Left main stem significant stenosis is defined as >50% luminal diameter (75% CSA reduction).
- It is important to assess each lesion in several views as the interobserver error is low for mild (<50%) and severe (>80%) luminal stenoses but the error is significant for stenoses 50-80%.
- More recently, fractional flow reserve (FFR) is being increasingly used to determine the haemodynamic significance of a coronary stenosis. FFR is calculated by the ratio of the coronary pressure distal to the lesion compared to the pressure proximal to the lesion. FFR in a normal coronary artery is 1.0, with an FFR <0.80 indicating an ischaemic coronary lesion (>90% accuracy). Data from the FAME study suggest that FFR-guided revascularisation, in comparison to angiography-guided revascularisation, results in improved freedom from death, myocardial infarction and repeat revascularisation.

#### 14 **What is TIMI flow?**

- TIMI (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction) derives its name from a trial of similar name and describes the different grades of coronary flow:
  - a) grade 0: no contrast flow;
  - b) grade 1: reduced flow and incomplete opacification of the distal vessel;
  - c) grade 2: slow distal filling but complete opacification of the distal vessel;
  - d) grade 3: prompt antegrade contrast flow with rapid clearing.

#### 15 **How are systemic-pulmonary shunt ratios calculated?**

• Using the Fick principle:

Flow = 
$$\frac{O_2 \text{ consumption}}{\text{arteriovenous } O_2 \text{ concentration difference}}$$

Flow = 
$$\frac{O_2 \text{ consumption}}{\text{arteriovenous } O_2 \text{ sats difference x Hb x 1.34 x10}}$$

Pulmonary flow = 
$$\frac{O_2 \text{ consumption}}{(PV O_2 \text{ sats - PA } O_2 \text{ sats}) \text{ x Hb x 1.34 x10}}$$

Systemic flow = 
$$\frac{O_2 \text{ consumption}}{(\text{Ao sats - RA sats}) \text{ x Hb x 1.34 x10}}$$

As O2 consumption and Hb are the same in both equations

Pulmonary flow: systemic flow ratio = 
$$\frac{PV O_2 \text{ sats - PA } O_2 \text{ sats}}{Ao \text{ sats - RA sats}}$$

PV 
$$O_2$$
 sats usually assumed to be 100%  
RA sats =  $(3 \times SVC \text{ sats}) + (1 \times IVC \text{ sats})$ 

where PV = pulmonary vein, PA = pulmonary artery, Ao = aorta, RA = right atrium, SVC = superior vena cava, IVC = inferior vena cava, Hb = haemoglobin, sats = saturations.

#### 16 **How is cardiac output calculated at cardiac catheterisation?**

• Using the direct Fick method:

Cardiac output = 
$$\frac{O_2 \text{ consumption}}{\text{AV } O_2 \text{ concentration difference}}$$
 $O_2 \text{ content} = (\text{Hb x 1.34 x } O_2 \text{ sats}) + \text{plasma } O_2 \text{ content}$ 
1g of Hb when 100% saturated combines with 1.34mL  $O_2 \text{ Plasma } O_2 \text{ content}$  in 100mL plasma ~0.3mL

CO = 
$$\frac{O_2 \text{ consumption}}{\{[(\text{Ao sats - PA sats}) x Hb x 1.34] + 0.3\} x 10\}}$$

where CO = cardiac output, AV = arteriovenous, Hb = haemoglobin, Ao = aorta, PA = pulmonary artery.

- Any systemic artery can be used for systemic saturations but the pulmonary artery must be used for the mixed venous content.
- Oxygen consumption is measured by the respiratory gas monitor on a ventilator.
- Cardiac output can also be measured using the indirect Fick method with dye dilution (similar to the thermodilution method used with pulmonary artery catheters).

#### 17 **How is the aortic valve area calculated by cardiac catheterisation (Figure 15)?**

• Using the Gorlin equation:

AoV area = AoV flow 44.5 x Ömean aortic gradient and as AoV flow = cardiac output systolic ejection period

AoV area = 
$$\frac{\text{CO}}{44.5 \text{ x SEP x } \sqrt{\text{mean aortic gradient}}}$$
  
and as SEP = left ventricular ejection time x heart rate

AoV area = CO 44.5 x LVET x HR x Ömean aortic gradient

where AoV = aortic valve, CO = cardiac output, SEP = systolic ejection period, LVET = left ventricular ejection time, HR = heart rate.

- The same formula and constant can be used for the pulmonary valve.
- Although this formula can be used with prosthetic valves, the calculations are dependent on 'forward flow', which is inaccurate in the presence of regurgitation.

**Figure 15. Gorlin method of calculating aortic valve area.**

#### 18 **How is the mitral valve area calculated by cardiac catheterisation?**

• Using the Gorlin equation:

MV area = 
$$\frac{\text{MV flow}}{31 \text{ x } \sqrt{\text{mean mitral gradient}}}$$
  
and as MV flow =  $\frac{\text{cardiac output}}{\text{diastolic filling period}}$ 

MV area = 
$$\frac{\text{CO}}{\text{31 x DFP x }\sqrt{\text{mean mitral gradient}}}$$

where MV = mitral valve, CO = cardiac output, DFP = diastolic filling period.

• The same formula and constant can be used for the tricuspid valve.

#### 19 **What is coronary artery intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)(Figure 16)?**

- IVUS is a transcatheter ultrasound probe that is introduced into the coronary artery over an angioplasty wire.
- It allows direct imaging of the luminal diameter and vessel wall giving a visual assessment of atheroma and calcification.
- It is useful in patients with equivocal stenosis and vessels with marked endoluminal calcification.

**Figure 17. Dip and plateau pressure waveform associated with constrictive pericarditis.**

#### 20 **What is intracoronary pressure wire monitoring?**

- Using a fine wire pressure transducer, the intracoronary pressure can be measured, thereby allowing a comparison of the pressure distal to the lesion with the pressure proximal to the lesion. This allows the fractional flow reserve (FFR) to be calculated to determine the haemodynamic significance of a lesion. The normal FFR should be approximately 1.0, whereas an FFR <0.8 indicates a significant flow limiting lesion.
- Flow limitation can also be assessed by measuring the pressure gradient after administering a vasodilator, e.g. adenosine.

#### 21 **What is the square root sign ('dip and plateau' pressure waveform)(Figure 17)?**

- The square root sign is defined as an abnormal ventricular diastolic filling pattern caused by rapid early ventricular filling followed by a sudden halt in ventricular filling.
- This occurs at the end of the first third of diastole onwards as the ventricle is unable to distend any further.
- The square root sign is associated with constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy but not with pericardial tamponade.
