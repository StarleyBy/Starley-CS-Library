#### 1 **What is <sup>a</sup> ventricular septal defect?**

- The International Society for Nomenclature of Paediatric and Congenital Heart Disease (ISNPCHD) defines a ventricular septal defect (VSD) as "a congenital cardiac malformation in which there is a hole or pathway between the ventricular chambers".
- This definition provided by the ISNPCHD has been incorporated into both the International Paediatric and Congenital Cardiac Code (IPCCC) and the Eleventh Iteration of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).
- Synonyms for ventricular septal defect include 'interventricular communication', 'interventricular septal defect', 'interventricular septum defect', 'ventricular septum defect', and 'VSD'.
- A VSD is defined both on the basis of its geographic location within the ventricular septum and its margins or borders as seen from the morphological right ventricle.
- The ISNPCHD states the following about VSD: "The definitions offered for a 'ventricular septal defect', in its various forms, will be used most frequently in the setting of patients who do not have abnormalities of either the atrioventricular or ventriculo-arterial connections. The definitions themselves, however, are equally applicable for the description and categorisation of holes or pathways between the ventricles when the segmental connections between the cardiac components are abnormal. The key to understanding the definitions is to appreciate that the hole or pathway between the ventricles is defined both on the basis of its geographic location within the ventricular septum and its margins as seen from the aspect of the morphological right ventricle. In this respect, when the ventriculoarterial connections are concordant or discordant, the roof of the channel, as viewed from the right ventricle, is the muscular outlet septum or its fibrous remnant. When both arterial trunks arise from the morphological right ventricle, in contrast, the channel between the ventricles provides the outflow from the morphological left ventricle, and is roofed by the inner heart curvature. In the setting of doubleoutlet right ventricle, therefore, the interventricular communication is not the same geometric locus as the ventricular septal defect, although

many still continue to describe the outlet from the left ventricle as the 'ventricular septal defect'. In univentricular atrioventricular connections with a functionally single left ventricle and an outflow chamber, the communication, which used to be called a bulboventricular foramen, is both a ventricular septal defect and an interventricular communication. The situation in the setting of double-outlet right ventricle, however, shows that the terms cannot always be used synonymously. A similar situation pertains in the setting of common arterial trunk, since the hole usually closed by the surgeon to provide septal integrity is the right ventricular margin of the channel between the ventricles, rather than the geometric interventricular communication."

- In the setting of double-outlet right ventricle, the VSD provides the outflow from the morphological left ventricle.
- In univentricular atrioventricular connections with a functionally single left ventricle and an outflow chamber, the communication is referred to by some as a bulboventricular foramen.

### 2 **How are ventricular septal defects classified?**

• Multiple systems of nomenclature have been used to describe and classify VSDs (Figure 1).

**Figure 1. Major systems of VSD nomenclature: A) classic system; B) VSD nomenclature described and utilised by Robert Anderson; and C) VSD nomenclature described and utilised by Richard and Stella Van Praagh.**

- Nevertheless, VSDs can all be grouped into one of five types (Figure 1):
  - a) perimembranous VSD (commonest form);
  - b) inlet VSD;
  - c) muscular VSD;
  - d) subarterial VSD;
  - e) Gerbode defect which represents a communication between the left ventricle and the right atrium.
- The International Paediatric and Congenital Cardiac Code (IPCCC) and the Eleventh Iteration of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) utilise the nomenclature, hierarchy, and definitions for VSD as outlined in Table 1.

interventricular part of the membranous septum; 2) is adjacent to the area of fibrous continuity between the leaflets of an atrioventricular valve and an arterial valve; 3) is adjacent to an area of mitral-tricuspid fibrous continuity; and 4) is located at the centre of the base of the ventricular mass".

- jìäíáéäÉ îÉåíêáÅìä~ê ëÉéí~ä ÇÉÑÉÅíë is defined as "a congenital cardiac malformation in which there are multiple ventricular septal defects, which could be of any type".

#### 3 **What are the morphological features of the different types of VSDs?**

According to the International Society for Nomenclature of Paediatric and Congenital Heart Disease (ISNPCHD):

- A perimembranous central ventricular septal defect is defined as "a congenital cardiovascular malformation in which there is a ventricular septal defect that: 1) occupies the space that is usually closed by the interventricular part of the membranous septum; 2) is adjacent to the area of fibrous continuity between the leaflets of an atrioventricular valve and an arterial valve, or two atrioventricular valves; and 3) is located at the centre of the base of the ventricular mass". (Figures 2 and 3).
- An inlet ventricular septal defect without a common atrioventricular junction is defined as "a congenital cardiac malformation in which there is a ventricular septal defect that opens predominantly into the inlet component of the right ventricle in the absence of a common atrioventricular junction".

**Figure 2. Perimembranous central ventricular septal defect (VSD): A) the top panel shows the opened right ventricle in attitudinally appropriate orientation. The perimembranous central ventricular septal defect is inferior to the medial papillary muscle, which arises from the caudal arm of the septal band. With this VSD, the ventriculo-infundibular fold (black asterisk) inserts normally between the cephalic and caudal arms of the septal band. The apex of the triangle of Koch lies superior to the coronary sinus and is delineated by the tendon of Todaro (red dots) and the hinge of the tricuspid valve (black dots); B) the bottom panel is the left ventricular view of the same heart. Along the posterior inferior border of the VSD, fibrous continuity is present between the tricuspid and aortic valves (black dots) and the tricuspid and mitral valves (yellow dots). The black arrows mark the anterior interventricular coronary artery.**

**Figure 3. Perimembranous ventricular septal defect (VSD) with extension to the inlet and trabecular components: A) the top panel shows a windowed right ventricle that is viewed anteriorly and from a slightly apical position. The chordal attachments of the tricuspid valve are seen along the caudal arm of the septal band with the ventriculo-infundibular fold (black asterisk) inserting in normal fashion between the caudal and cephalic arms of the septal band. The inferior border of the VSD extends beneath the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve and into the inlet component of the right ventricle; B) the bottom panel is viewed from the left ventricle, and the chordal attachments of the tricuspid valve can easily be seen along the edge of the VSD. There is fibrous continuity between the tricuspid and aortic valves, with a much more extensive area of fibrous continuity between the tricuspid and mitral valves.**

• A muscular VSD represents a congenital cardiovascular malformation in which there is a VSD that has exclusively muscular borders (Figure 4).

![](_page_9_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Figure 4. A) The top panel is a four-chamber view of a heart that is viewed from posterior to anterior and in attitudinally appropriate fashion. A restrictive, muscular ventricular septal defect is present in the midinterventricular septum. B) The bottom panel is a view of the right atrioventricular junction with a muscular ventricular septal defect at the mid-septum. Note the prominent septoparietal trabeculations and the spaces between them that mimic muscular ventricular septal defects.**

• A subarterial VSD represents a congenital cardiovascular malformation in which there is a VSD positioned directly beneath one or both semilunar valves (Figures 5 and 6).

![](_page_10_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Figure 5. Subarterial ventricular septal defect (VSD): A) the top panel is viewed from the right ventricle. The ventricular septal defect is doubly committed and juxta-arterial with fibrous continuity (red dots) between the pulmonary and aortic valvar leaflets at the roof of the defect. The posteroinferior muscular rim (yellow dots) separates the leaflets of the tricuspid and aortic valves and protects the conduction tissue. Because of the posteroinferior muscular rim, this defect is not perimembranous; B) the bottom panel is viewed from the left ventricle. The aortic valve is seen at the roof of the defect which is in a subarterial position. The red dots mark the area of fibrous continuity between the aortic and pulmonary valves at the roof of the defect, although in this view the pulmonary valve is not seen.**

**Figure 6. This ventricular septal defect (VSD, asterisk) can be called a 'subarterial ventricular septal' defect and also can be called a 'doubly committed juxtaarterial ventricular septal defect'. The VSD is exposed through a posterosuperior section of the base of the heart. The VSD can be seen below the pulmonary and aortic valves.** *Image reproduced with the permission of Professor Robert H.

- A Gerbode defect represents a deficiency of the atrioventricular component of the membranous septum permitting shunting of blood from the left ventricle to the right atrium.
- 4 **Describe the anatomy of the conduction system associated with a ventricular septal defect (Figure 7)**
- In a patient with concordant atrioventricular connections and a perimembranous VSD, the atrioventricular node is located at the apex of the triangle of Koch. The triangle of Koch is located in the superficial endocardium of the right atrium and has the following boundaries:
  - a) the coronary sinus orifice;
  - b) the tendon of Todaro; and
  - c) the hinge point of the septal leaflet of the right atrioventricular valve.

- The conduction bundle starts at the atrioventricular node, penetrates the central fibrous body, and passes to the left side of the septum along the posteroinferior rim of the VSD.
- It is important to distinguish the common perimembranous VSD from the less common muscular VSD in the inlet septum under the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. A perimembranous defect has a border that includes a fibrous portion along the tricuspid valve, where the tricuspid, mitral and aortic valves meet. Meanwhile, a muscular VSD has borders that consist entirely of ventricular septal muscle, and the muscular VSD is separated from the annulus of the tricuspid valve by a bar of muscle.
- The conduction system passes posteroinferior to a perimembranous VSD but anterosuperior to a muscular inlet VSD.
- Rarely, a perimembranous VSD and a muscular inlet VSD will both exist in the same patient. In this rare situation, conduction tissue is located in the muscular bridge between the two VSDs (Figure 7).
- In a patient with a muscular VSD in the trabecular or outlet septum, the VSD is remote from the conduction tissue.
- In a patient with a doubly committed juxta-arterial VSD with a muscular posterior inferior rim, the VSD is remote from the conduction tissue.
- In a patient with a doubly committed juxta-arterial VSD with a perimembranous inferior rim, the conduction system passes posteroinferior to the perimembranous border of the defect, similar to any other perimembranous VSD.

**Figure 7. Coexistence of a perimembranous ventricular septal defect (VSD) and muscular inlet ventricular septal defect (VSD): A) exposed through the tricuspid valve via a right atriotomy. The conduction tissue is located in the bridge of muscle between the two VSDs and is located in the usual position relative to each VSD. This muscular bridge between the two VSDs contains conduction tissue and may be quite narrow; therefore, in order to avoid heart block, these two VSDs should be closed with a single patch; B) the top panel shows the opened right atrioventricular junction. The most inferior VSD is a muscular inlet defect. There is a muscular bar separating this muscular inlet VSD from the more superior, perimembranous VSD. In this case, the conduction tissue will pass anterosuperior to the muscular VSD and posteroinferior to the perimembranous VSD. The apex of the triangle of Koch points directly to the attachment of the muscle bar at the atrioventricular junction. (Red dots indicate the tendon of Todaro, and black dots indicate the hinge point of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve.); C) the bottom panel is the left ventricular view from the same heart showing both the muscular inlet and perimembranous defects. The muscular bar that interposes between the defects is marked with black dots.**

#### 5 **What is the embryological aetiology of <sup>a</sup> ventricular septal defect?**

- An interventricular communication (interventricular foramen) is part of the normal circulatory pattern during the first 8 weeks of foetal life.
- This embryonic interventricular communication between the ventricles is bounded by the:
  - a) so-called tubercles that grow from the ventricular aspect of the atrioventricular cushions once the aorta is committed to the left ventricle;
  - b) crest of the muscular ventricular septum, that forms the floor of this area;
  - c) inner heart curvature, that forms the roof;
  - d) septal and parietal cushions within the outflow tract, that will eventually fuse to separate the aortic and pulmonary outflow tracts.
- A perimembranous VSD will result from failure of this embryonic interventricular communication to close (Figure 8A).
- Muscular VSDs result from failure of the trabeculations of the muscular ventricular septum to coalesce. These defects can occur in any part of the muscular septum (Figure 8B).
- A subarterial VSD results from failure of muscularisation of the fused proximal septal and parietal outflow cushions or hypoplasia of the septal and parietal outflow cushions (Figure 8C).

Anderson, Biosciences Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.*

#### 6 **What anomalies are associated with <sup>a</sup> ventricular septal defect?**

- Atrial septal defect (ASD).
- Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA; also known as the patent arterial duct [PAD]).
- Coarctation of the aorta.
- Interrupted aortic arch or aortic arch hypoplasia.
- Atrioventricular septal defect.
- Malformations involving the ventricular outflow tracts, including:
  - a) tetralogy of Fallot (TOF);
  - b) double-outlet right ventricle (DORV);
  - c) common arterial trunk (CAT, truncus arteriosus [TA]);
  - d) transposition of the great arteries (TGA).
- Functionally univentricular heart ('single ventricle').
- Many patients, however, have an isolated VSD, without any associated anomalies.

#### 7 **What is the epidemiology of <sup>a</sup> ventricular septal defect?**

- Isolated VSD is the second most common congenital cardiac malformation (after bicuspid aortic valve) and occurs at a rate of approximately 2 per 1000 live births.
- Isolated VSDs account for about one-fifth of all forms of congenital heart disease.
- Over 50% of patients with a congenitally malformed heart have either an isolated VSD or a VSD associated with other major defects.
- Chromosomal, familial, and geographic factors influence the normal closure of the embryonic interventricular communication and the normal formation of the ventricular septum.
- Perimembranous defects are the commonest form of VSD.
- Subarterial defects are more common in patients of Asian descent.
- Children of patients with a VSD have a higher incidence of congenital heart disease, although not necessarily specifically a VSD.

#### 8 **What is the pathophysiology of <sup>a</sup> ventricular septal defect?**

- A ventricular septal defect usually results in a left-to-right shunt, the magnitude of which is determined by the:
  - a) size of the VSD;
  - b) pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR);
  - c) degree of obstruction to pulmonary or aortic outflow;
  - d) ventricular compliance.
- Early in life, the pathophysiology is predominantly determined by the pulmonary vascular resistance; whereas later in life, the degree of narrowing and eventual closure of the VSD may become more important.
- Excessive left-to-right shunting results in heart failure, which manifests as dyspnoea, poor feeding, frequent upper respiratory infections, and failure to thrive.
- Children with a restrictive VSD will have less left-to-right shunting and may remain asymptomatic with little or no medical therapy.
- Right-to-left shunting in patients with obstruction to pulmonary outflow will cause cyanosis, such as in patients with tetralogy of Fallot.
- Right-to-left shunting in patients with elevated PVR will also cause cyanosis.

#### 9 **What is the natural history of <sup>a</sup> ventricular septal defect?**

- The clinical course can be quite variable and depends on the:
  - a) size of the VSD;
  - b) magnitude of the left-to-right shunt;
  - c) pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR);
  - d) associated cardiac malformations.
- Most VSDs are restrictive and usually less than 5mm in diameter.
- Small VSDs often undergo spontaneous closure, which most frequently occurs during the first year of life, but continues to a lesser degree until about 5 years of age. Spontaneous closure becomes rare after 5 years of age.

- Spontaneous closure can be attributed to:
  - a) fibrosis of the margins induced by haemodynamic changes and flow;
  - b) adherence of tricuspid or aortic valve leaflets to the margins of the defect;
  - c) septal hypertrophy, which occurs most commonly with muscular VSDs.
- Spontaneous closure of a VSD (or partial closure of a VSD) from prolapse of an aortic valve leaflet, however, can cause aortic insufficiency and represents an indication for surgical repair. (It is easier to close the VSD than it is to repair or replace the aortic valve later in life.)
- In patients with larger VSDs, symptoms develop soon after birth when the elevated foetal and neonatal pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) falls.
- With increasing age, increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) may develop secondary to increased pulmonary blood flow and hypertensive pulmonary vascular disease.
- Children with unrepaired non-restrictive VSDs are at risk of developing irreversible pulmonary vascular disease at 1 to 2 years of age (and later in life).
- Eisenmenger syndrome may develop if a large VSD is not closed. Eisenmenger syndrome most frequently appears in the second and third decades of life, and typically leads to death by the age of 40. It is characterised by:
  - a) irreversible pulmonary vascular disease;
  - b) pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) greater than systemic vascular resistance;
  - c) reversal of the ventricular shunt with resultant cyanosis;
  - d) eventual right ventricular failure.

#### 10 **What are the symptoms of <sup>a</sup> ventricular septal defect?**

- A VSD with significant left-to-right shunting will result in congestive heart failure, often presenting with:
  - a) tachypnoea or dyspnoea;
  - b) repeated pulmonary infections;
  - c) hepatomegaly;

- d) sweating, especially while eating;
- e) feeding intolerance;
- f) failure to thrive.
- A VSD with significant right-to-left shunting, however, will result in systemic hypoxia and lack of pulmonary blood flow, and present with:
  - a) failure to thrive;
  - b) cyanosis;
  - c) clubbing.

#### 11 **What are the signs of <sup>a</sup> ventricular septal defect?**

- Patients with a restrictive VSD have a loud holosystolic murmur, which is best heard at the left sternal border:
  - a) the intensity of the murmur can be quite variable, but it can be inversely related to the size of the defect;
  - b) as the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) rises, the murmur becomes shorter, softer, and the murmur is limited to the early part of systole. The murmur may actually disappear entirely, leaving a loud second heart sound, which is caused by closure of the pulmonary valve and may be indicative of severe pulmonary hypertension;
  - c) the murmur may be accompanied by a hyperactive precordium and a ventricular bulge.
- Some patients with a large VSD may or may not have a murmur but may present with hepatomegaly and jugular venous distension.
- Typically, cyanotic children (such as children with tetralogy of Fallot) may use squatting to increase pulmonary blood flow.

#### 12 **What are the electrocardiographic features of <sup>a</sup> patient with a ventricular septal defect (Figure 9)?**

- The electrocardiogram may be normal.
- If abnormal, the electrocardiogram may show:
  - a) right ventricular hypertrophy;
  - b) left ventricular hypertrophy;
  - c) combined right and left ventricular hypertrophy.

**Figure 9. 12-lead-electrocardiograms demonstrating biventricular hypertrophy (left and right ventricular hypertrophy) in infants with a ventricular septal defect: A) the upper 12-lead electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The deep S waves in lead V1 and tall R waves in leads V5 and V6 are indicative of LVH; B) the lower 12-lead electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with slight right axis deviation and evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The deep S waves in lead V1 and tall R waves in leads V5 and V6 are indicative of LVH. Biventricular hypertrophy is also seen by the presence of large biphasic QRS complexes (i.e. tall R waves and deep S waves) in leads V2-V5.**

- 13 **What are the chest radiographical features of <sup>a</sup> patient with a ventricular septal defect (Figure 10)?**
- The extent of abnormal findings on chest radiograph (CXR) is related to the size of the left-to-right shunt.

- Abnormal findings on CXR can include varying degrees of increased pulmonary vascularity and cardiomegaly with biventricular enlargement.
- In extreme cases, a pleural effusion can be seen.

**Figure 10. Chest radiograph demonstrating increased pulmonary vascularity and cardiomegaly in an infant with a ventricular septal defect.**

#### 14 **What are the echocardiographic features of <sup>a</sup> patient with a ventricular septal defect?**

- Cross-sectional and Doppler echocardiography is the gold standard diagnostic modality for VSD, as it permits:
  - a) diagnosis of the VSD, by demonstrating a defect in the continuity of the interventricular septum;
  - b) determination of the type of VSD and its borders, with description of both its geographic location within the ventricular septum and its margins as seen from the morphological right ventricle (Figures and 13);
  - c) documentation of the presence of an interventricular shunt;
  - d) assessment of the degree of shunting and the consequent volume overload;
  - e) diagnosis of associated cardiac malformations;

- g) assessment of the possible involvement of the aortic and tricuspid valve leaflets;
- h) assessment of the proximity of the VSD to the subvalvar structures of the atrioventricular valves.

#### 15 **What are cardiac catheterisation findings of <sup>a</sup> patient with a ventricular septal defect?**

- In the developed world, most patients with an isolated large VSD have their defect surgically closed by months of age, when pulmonary arterial pressures are unlikely to be irreversibly high. Consequently, cardiac catheterisation does not impact on the decision to perform surgical closure in the vast majority of cases.
- In selected patients with a simple VSD, cardiac catheterisation is still necessary, as it can provide the:
  - a) pulmonary arterial pressure;
  - b) ratio of pulmonary to systemic flows (Qp:Qs ratio);
  - c) pulmonary vascular resistance;
  - d) response of the pulmonary arterial vasculature to vasodilators, such as oxygen (O2), nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandin (including prostacyclin, which is also called prostaglandin I2 or PGI2).
- Cardiac catheterisation is specifically indicated in an older child or a young adult with a:
  - a) moderate-large VSD, where there is a high likelihood of irreversibly elevated pulmonary arterial pressures, including those with cyanosis or a bidirectional or right-to-left shunt on echocardiographic assessment;
  - b) small VSD to calculate the Qp:Qs ratio, as surgery is usually indicated if Qp:Qs >1.5:1 and is almost certainly indicated if Qp:Qs >2:1.

#### 16 **What are the principles of medical therapy for <sup>a</sup> patient with a ventricular septal defect?**

- Medical management is indicated in neonates and young infants presenting with:
  - a) mild congestive heart failure from a small to moderate defect, as a bridge to resolution (by spontaneous closure or restriction);

- b) more severe forms of congestive heart failure from a large defect, as a bridge to definitive surgery;
- c) increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR);
- d) endocarditis, who will require prophylactic antibiotic administration.
- Medical therapy for congestive cardiac failure may include:
  - a) cardiac glycosides (e.g. digitalis and digoxin);
  - b) diuretic therapy;
  - c) afterload reduction with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors;
  - d) supplemental nutritional support for those with poor feeding or failure to thrive;
  - e) optimal antibiotic therapy for those with recurrent pulmonary infections.

#### 17 **What are the principles of palliative treatment for <sup>a</sup> ventricular septal defect?**

- Placement of a pulmonary artery band (PAB) is a surgical procedure that is performed without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (Figure 14). The operation involves placing some form of a tie, ligature, or device around the main pulmonary artery to decrease pulmonary blood flow and palliate a patient with a VSD.
- PAB is rarely performed today. Potential indications for placement of a PAB in the modern era include the following (modified from Rajesh Sharma):
  - a) palliation of the neonate or infant with a VSD and contraindications to CPB;
  - b) Swiss cheese type of multiple ventricular septal defects;
  - c) neonatal apical muscular VSD;
  - d) neonatal PAB combined with repair of aortic coarctation in a patient with VSD and aortic coarctation;
  - e) neonatal PAB combined with repair of aortic coarctation in a patient with an atrioventricular septal defect and aortic coarctation;
  - f) postponing the choice between biventricular repair and univentricular palliation in a patient with a VSD and ventricular imbalance;
  - g) postponing the choice between biventricular repair and univentricular palliation in a patient with an unbalanced atrioventricular septal defect;

**Figure 14. Pulmonary artery banding: A) following dissection of a plane between the aorta and main pulmonary artery, an umbilical tape (or polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE] band, white band), is passed around the main pulmonary artery (MPA), maintaining an adequate distance from both the sinotubular junction and the pulmonary arterial bifurcation; B) the ends of the tape are then sewn together to create a band around the main pulmonary artery (MPA); C) the band can then be progressively tightened (as required) and is secured in place to avoid migration using nonabsorbable or absorbable sutures, depending on whether the band is likely to be removed surgically or percutaneously. Once the band is secured, the pulmonary arterial pressure distal to the band is measured to ensure an appropriate reduction in pulmonary arterial pressure. The target pressure in the pulmonary artery distal to the pulmonary artery band is commonly 30-50% of systemic arterial pressure for a biventricular heart; however, for a univentricular heart, the target pressure may be as close to the Fontan pressure as possible if tolerated (i.e. mean of pulmonary artery pressure distal to the band of 15mmHg). The manometers in this drawing indicate the percentage of systemic arterial pressure that is measured in the pulmonary artery distal to the pulmonary artery band. Ao = aorta; LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle; MPA = main pulmonary artery; RA = right atrium; RV = right ventricle.**

- h) defects with complex anatomy where a biventricular repair of better quality may be possible later in life when the cardiac structures are larger, such as complete atrioventricular septal defect or a crisscross heart;
- i) univentricular physiology with unrestricted pulmonary blood flow, to drop pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) to levels suitable for future univentricular palliation;
- j) the extremely marasmic, septic infant; or

- k) the infant who presents with a contraindication for CPB, such as a neonate with a recent intracranial bleed.
- Additional newer indications for placement of a PAB include the following:
  - a) left ventricular preparation for an involuted subpulmonary left ventricle in a patient with transposition of the great arteries (TGA — concordant atrioventricular connections with discordant ventriculo-arterial connections) who presents late, in preparation for an arterial switch operation;
  - b) left ventricular preparation and/or reduction of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA — discordant atrioventricular connections with discordant ventriculo-arterial connections), often with tricuspid regurgitation and without a sizeable VSD;
  - c) PAB as an adjunct to another procedure, such as:
    - i) PAB as an adjunct to a bidirectional Glenn shunt, to maintain antegrade pulmonary blood flow with acceptable superior caval pressures; and
    - ii) PAB as part of a palliative arterial switch operation.
- Controversial indications for placement of a PAB include the following:
  - a) routine initial PAB for ccTGA VSD, in a proposed strategy towards preserving left ventricular function following anatomical repair;
  - b) adjunctive PAB along with physiological correction of late presenting simple TGA for future conversion to anatomical repair;
  - c) PAB for reversing the advanced pulmonary vasculopathy in a patient with unoperated congenital heart disease with Eisenmenger syndrome.
- Adequate banding has traditionally aimed to reduce the distal pulmonary arterial pressures to 50% of systemic level, so long as pulmonary blood flow will maintain adequate oxygenation.

#### 18 **What are the indications for therapeutic closure of <sup>a</sup> ventricular septal defect (Figure 15)?**

• The definitive treatment of a VSD is complete closure of the defect, which is usually performed surgically but may be performed by placement of a transcatheter device in selected patients.

![](_page_28_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 15. Algorithm describing the therapeutic strategies for a ventricular septal defect (VSD). AI = aortic insufficiency; AVSD = atrioventricular septal defect; DORV = double-outlet right ventricle; PAB = pulmonary artery banding; PM = perimembranous; VSD = ventricular septal defect. TGA = transposition of the great arteries; TOF = tetralogy of Fallot.**

- The criteria for closure of a VSD is based upon the:
  - a) size and type of the VSD;
  - b) natural history and the intervening symptoms;
  - c) associated cardiac malformations;
  - d) complicating factors.
- Infants with a large VSD and severe, intractable congestive heart failure (not responsive to medical therapy) should undergo surgical closure at any time during the first 3 months of life.

- Infants with a large VSD and congestive heart failure that respond to medical therapy are managed with conservative follow-up, medical therapy, and surgical closure at about months of age.
- Older children with restrictive VSDs should undergo closure of the VSD in the presence of:
  - a) Qp:Qs >2:1;
  - b) ventricular dilatation (even if the left-to-right shunt is <2:1);
  - c) prolapse of the aortic valve leaflets into the VSD (even in the absence of aortic insufficiency);
  - d) previous endocarditis.
- All doubly committed and juxta-arterial defects (conal VSD) should be closed regardless of the magnitude of the left-to-right shunt, in order to protect the aortic valve from prolapse and possible insufficiency, as there is no likelihood of spontaneous closure. (It is easier to close the VSD than it is to repair or replace the aortic valve later in life.)

#### 19 **What are the contraindications for therapeutic closure of a ventricular septal defect?**

- Patients with a dominant right-to-left shunt and calculated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) >8 units/m2, who show no response to pulmonary arterial vasodilatation, are not candidates for surgical closure. (These patients often have a history of some previous clinical improvement due to the decreased left-to-right shunt in response to the increased pulmonary vascular resistance.)
- Asymptomatic patients with a small VSD and Qp:Qs <1.5:1, and without a history of prolapse of the aortic valvar leaflet(s), endocarditis, or ventricular dilatation, do not require closure of their VSDs, with the exception of doubly committed and juxta-arterial defects.

#### 20 **What are the principles of device closure for <sup>a</sup> ventricular septal defect?**

• Transcatheter device closure of a perimembranous VSD is currently experimental and is associated with the risk of heart block and damage to the leaflets of the tricuspid and aortic valves. Transcatheter device closure of a perimembranous VSD, hence, should be reserved for patients who are not surgical candidates and who require VSD closure.

- Transcatheter device closure of a doubly committed juxta-arterial VSD is also currently experimental and is associated with risk of damage to the leaflets of the aortic and pulmonary valve. Transcatheter device closure of a doubly committed juxta-arterial VSD, hence, should be reserved for patients who are not surgical candidates and who require VSD closure.
- Transcatheter device closure of some muscular VSDs, however, can be safely accomplished (Figure 16). This approach may facilitate closure of a muscular VSD that is difficult to approach with conventional surgery.

![](_page_30_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 16. Transcatheter device closure of a mid-muscular VSD.**

- Transcatheter device closure of a muscular VSD is performed in the catheterisation laboratory, under general anaesthesia, generally using both fluoroscopy and transoesophageal echocardiography for guidance.
- Access to the VSD is obtained through both the left ventricle (via the femoral artery or carotid artery, often by cut-down) and the right

ventricle (via the femoral vein or internal jugular vein), to create a loop between the guidewires, in order to ensure complete control over the positioning of the device.

- A hybrid approach to a muscular VSD closure uses access to the anterior wall of the right ventricle via a sternotomy, with the device inserted through a sheath surgically implanted through the right ventricular anterior wall.
- Both the percutaneous and the hybrid procedure can result in malposition of the occluding device with a residual shunt, device dislodgement, or device entrapment in the subvalvar apparatus of the atrioventricular valves.

#### 21 **What are the principles of surgery for repair of <sup>a</sup> ventricular septal defect?**

- Almost all VSDs are closed using median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass, and cardioplegia-induced diastolic arrest of the heart.
- Factors that influence the surgical approach include the:
  - a) location of the VSD;
  - b) location of the conduction pathways;
  - c) relationship of the atrioventricular valvar leaflets or arterial valvar leaflets to the VSD;
  - d) associated cardiac malformations that require repair.
- In general, there are six surgical approaches for VSD closure (Figure 17), including the:
  - a) right atrial approach;
  - b) transpulmonary approach;
  - c) transaortic approach;
  - d) right ventricular outflow tract approach;
  - e) right ventricular apical approach;
  - f) left ventricular approach.
- A combined approach may be required with multiple defects or defects that have extensive involvement of more than one region of the septum.

**Figure 17.** Surgical approaches to ventricular septal defect repair, including transatrial approach; transacrtic approach; transpulmonary approach; right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) approach; and right ventricular apical approach. Ao = aorta; LV = left ventricle; MPA = main pulmonary artery; RA = right atrium; RV = right ventricle; RVOT = right ventricular outflow tract.

## 22 What structures are at risk during surgical repair of a ventricular septal defect?

- Atrioventricular node and conduction pathways.
- Atrioventricular valve leaflets, especially the tricuspid valve.
- Arterial valve leaflets, especially the aortic valve.

## 23 What are the principles of surgery to repair a perimembranous ventricular septal defect (Figure 18)?

 Almost all perimembranous VSDs are closed via a median sternotomy, with cardiopulmonary bypass, using bicaval venous cannulation, and antegrade cardioplegia delivered via the aortic root to achieve diastolic arrest of the heart.

- Although most perimembranous VSDs are accessed through a right atriotomy (Figure 17 and 18A), some perimembranous VSDs are approached via a right ventriculotomy, which can also be used to repair associated cardiac malformations, such as:
  - a) common arterial trunk (truncus arteriosus);
  - b) tetralogy of Fallot;
  - c) double-outlet right ventricle;
  - d) subarterial doubly committed VSD.
- Most perimembranous VSDs are closed with a patch (Figures 18B and 18C), which can be secured using a continuous (Figure 18B) or interrupted (Figure 18C) suturing technique.
- Patch materials used to close VSDs include the following options:
  - a) autologous tissue, such as unfixed or fixed pericardium;
  - b) heterologous tissue, such as fixed bovine pericardium or fixed porcine pericardium; or
  - c) synthetic materials, such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Gore-Tex® or Impra®) or polyethylene terephthalate (PET, Dacron®).
- Some smaller perimembranous VSDs may be closed primarily, often with pledgeted horizontal mattress sutures.
- The following structures are at risk during surgical repair of a perimembranous VSD:
  - a) atrioventricular node and conduction tissue;
  - b) leaflets of the tricuspid valve; and
  - c) leaflets of the aortic valve.
- The patch is usually sutured to the rim of the VSD, placing the sutures on the right ventricular side of the interventricular septum.
- Once the annulus of the septal tricuspid valve leaflet is reached, the sutures are passed through the septal leaflet in order to avoid damage to the atrioventricular node and conduction pathways (Figure 18D). The portion of the suture line sewn to the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve is often reinforced with a strip of autologous pericardium (or interrupted pledgets if an interrupted technique is utilised).

**Figure 18. Operative images demonstrating surgical repair of a perimembranous ventricular septal defect (VSD): A) surgical view of the opened right atrium in a heart on cardiopulmonary bypass. A vent is inserted through the interatrial septum into the left atrium to drain pulmonary venous return and improve exposure. The VSD is visualised through the tricuspid valve. This exposure is the most common technique and pathway for closure of a ventricular septal defect. The septal tricuspid valve leaflet is then retracted posteriorly and the VSD is exposed; B) closure of a perimembranous VSD with a Dacron® patch sutured into position with a continuous running suture; C) closure of a perimembranous VSD with a Dacron® patch sutured into position with an interrupted suturing technique; D) after patch closure of the perimembranous ventricular septal defect, the right ventricle is filled with saline in order to 'float' the tricuspid valve and demonstrate competence of the valve with absence of tricuspid regurgitation. The strip of autologous pericardial pledget (black arrow) is seen where the patch is sutured to the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve and the anteroseptal commissure of the tricuspid valve. ASL = anterosuperior leaflet; PL = posterior leaflet (also known as the inferior leaflet, as well as the posteroinferior leaflet); SL = septal leaflet.**

#### 24 **What are the principles of surgery to repair <sup>a</sup> subarterial ventricular septal defect?**

- Most subarterial VSDs are closed using a transpulmonary approach, although some may be closed with a right ventriculotomy at the level of the outflow tract.
- A patch may be secured using a continuous or an interrupted suturing technique.
- The following structures are at risk during surgical repair of a subarterial VSD:
  - a) leaflets of the pulmonary valve;
  - b) leaflets of the aortic valve; and
  - c) atrioventricular node and conduction tissues (if the subarterial VSD has perimembranous extension).
- Often the superior portion of the patch is sutured to the annulus of the pulmonary valve, because in hearts with a doubly committed juxta-arterial VSD, the pulmonary valve and the aortic valve may only be separated by a thin fibrous raphe. (In order to avoid damage to the aortic leaflets, the sutures are passed through the base of the pulmonary leaflets.)

#### 25 **What are the principles of surgery to repair <sup>a</sup> muscular ventricular septal defect?**

- Depending on its location, a muscular VSD may be accessed using a:
  - a) right atrial approach;
  - b) right ventricular approach;
  - c) transpulmonary approach;
  - d) transaortic approach;
  - e) left ventricular approach.
- Most muscular VSDs are closed with a patch, which can be secured using a continuous or an interrupted suturing technique (Figure 19).
- Some smaller muscular VSDs may be closed primarily, often with pledgeted horizontal mattress sutures or occasionally using a continuous suture.

![](_page_36_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 19. Surgical patch repair of a mid-muscular VSD using a continuous suturing technique.**

- A complex form of muscular VSD is known as a 'Swiss cheese septum', where multiple defects are spread across a large portion of the interventricular septum. Treatment options include:
  - a) palliation with pulmonary artery banding, which allows the child to grow to reduce the risk of an early complete repair. Whilst the band is in place, some of the defects may spontaneously close, thereby reducing the extent of the subsequent repair;
  - b) early repair with a combination of direct suture closure, patch closure, and endocardialisation, where several defects are closed by suturing together bands of right ventricular muscle to obtain a continuous surface of muscle on the right side of the interventricular septum (Figure 20).

![](_page_37_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 20. Surgical repair of a 'Swiss cheese septum' via a right atrial approach: A) several defects are seen in the inlet, perimembranous, and low right ventricular outflow tract regions, with the location of the conduction system identified (green line); B) one of the muscle bands is resected (red dotted line in image A) to expose the extent and margins of the underlying defect; C) this strategy allows the smaller defects to be repaired with a combination of primary suture and endocardialisation; D) the larger defects are repaired with porcine pericardial patches. ASL = anterosuperior leaflet; PL = posterior leaflet (also known as the inferior leaflet, as well as the posteroinferior leaflet); SL = septal leaflet; SMT = septomarginal trabeculation.**

#### 26 **What are the short-term outcomes of surgery following repair of a ventricular septal defect?**

• An analysis from the Congenital Heart Surgery Database of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) of 7474 patch closures of a VSD from 2015 to 2018, inclusive, performed at 117 hospitals in North America, demonstrated an:

- a) aggregate rate of operative mortality of 0.5% (operative mortality is defined in all STS databases as: 1) all deaths, regardless of cause, occurring during the hospitalisation in which the operation was performed, even if after 30 days [including patients transferred to other acute care facilities]; and 2) all deaths, regardless of cause, occurring after discharge from the hospital, but before the end of the 30th postoperative day);
- b) aggregate average postoperative length of stay of 9.9 days.

#### 27 **What are the complications of surgery following repair of a ventricular septal defect?**

- The most common complication after repair of a ventricular septal defect is an arrhythmia:
  - a) five to 15% of patients experience a transient postoperative arrhythmia that does not require a permanent pacemaker and is managed medically, with temporary pacing, electrical cardioversion or defibrillation;
  - b) less than 2% of patients experience a postoperative arrhythmia that requires a permanent pacemaker.
- Less than 3% of patients experience postoperative respiratory insufficiency requiring reintubation.
- Less than 2% of patients experience a variety of other complications, including:
  - a) postoperative low cardiac output;
  - b) pleural effusion requiring drainage;
  - c) unplanned readmission within 30 days;
  - d) postoperative respiratory insufficiency requiring mechanical ventilation for more than 7 days;
  - e) chylothorax;
  - f) pneumothorax;
  - g) unplanned cardiac reoperation exclusive of bleeding;
  - h) unplanned non-cardiac reoperation during the postoperative period.

- Less than 1% of patients experience:
  - a) pulmonary hypertension;
  - b) pericardial effusion requiring drainage;
  - c) pneumonia;
  - d) postoperative septicaemia;
  - e) postoperative cardiac arrest;
  - f) bleeding requiring reoperation.

#### 28 **What are the long-term outcomes of surgery following repair of a ventricular septal defect?**

- The operative mortality associated with surgical repair of an isolated ventricular septal defect is less than 1%.
- The risk of any major morbidity (including atrioventricular block requiring a pacemaker, emergent reoperation, and significant residual shunting) is less than 2%.
- Thus, over 97% of patients have excellent outcomes.
- Most patients survive repair with no long-term negative impact from their surgical repair.
- Patients with aortic insufficiency related to prolapse of an aortic valve leaflet require lifelong follow-up, but usually will not require surgical intervention on the aortic valve.
