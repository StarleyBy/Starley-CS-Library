# Informed consent in congenital cardiac surgery

Robert A. Wheeler

#### What is the role of consent in modern society?

- Choice has achieved a high priority in our society.
- Citizens' choices in education, transport structure and healthcare provision, to name a few, are constantly and publically acknowledged.
- The necessity for choice reflects the fundamental role of autonomy: the right of every citizen to influence their own destiny.
- In this context, the need to choose to accept (consent) the otherwise unwanted physical contact of any type (touch) is self-evident. In fact, unwelcome attentions from another person who tries to touch you against your wishes are considered repellent.
- There are times when certain contacts or touches are unavoidable, such as in packed trains, shops and sidewalks. In some cases, there is little choice but to resign yourself to being touched.
- But in any less frenetic circumstances, there is an absolute understanding that we are entitled to choose who touches us, and when.

### 2 Why is consent necessary in health care?

- One important consequence of the need for consent is that a patient, or their parent, must agree in advance of physical touching, before any intervention can ensue.
- The teenage patient, who is lying on his or her hospital bed, when suddenly confronted with a surgeon who puts his or her hand on the apex beat without first asking for permission, would justifiably complain that the treatment fell below the reasonable standard one would be entitled to expect. Clearly, such behaviour is simple rudeness, irrespective of the legal context.
- However, the legal context is suddenly placed into stark relief when a patient complains that an intimate examination was performed without consent; and further still when such an examination was irrelevant to his or her clinical presentation.

- These latter actions move the lack of consent into the arena of professional disciplinary regulation, as well as civil litigation and potentially criminal prosecution. Several medical defence organisations' case reports are a testament to this not infrequent and devastating error of judgement.
- Plainly, interventions required in congenital cardiac surgery are more complex and threatening than the simple touch. But the need for consent, based on disclosure as to what is entailed and why it is necessary, is built upon this elementary foundation.

#### 3 **Is consent needed for anything other than treatment interventions?**

- In paediatric cardiac surgery, the patient or parent must agree, in advance, before any of the confidential information that they impart when dealing with their surgeon can be further disclosed.
- Clearly, it is consent for surgical intervention that is uppermost on the surgeon's mind, and rightly so.
- But the rules of consent encompassing aspects of care, such as competence or capacity, correct disclosure and appropriate recording, are equally applicable to both clinical interventions and to confidentiality.
- Consent is the legal key that makes both physical intervention and sharing of information lawful.

### 4 **What is <sup>a</sup> child, under English law?**

- From the legal perspective, a child is someone who has not yet reached 18 years of age. Legal synonyms include 'minor' and 'infant'. The latter is instructive, since it is derived from the Latin, áåÑ~åë, unable to speak.
- This reflects the legal rule preventing children from speaking for themselves in court, although this impediment has been at least partly addressed over the last two decades.
- Nevertheless, this definition begs a fundamental question; as to whether children can provide their own consent, or whether they depend upon their parents to provide it for them.

### 5 **What is <sup>a</sup> 'young person' under English law?**

• It is becoming more common in England to describe citizens of 16 and 17 years as 'young people'. This acknowledges that they are still children from the legal perspective, whilst at the same time accepting

- that as they approach majority, their autonomy is emerging, reflected by certain legal rights.
- For instance, the Mental Capacity Act 2005 applies to those who are 16 years and over, prescribing measures to be taken if they lack capacity.
- Nevertheless, those with parental responsibility for young people retain parallel rights to consent on their behalf, although these rights diminish as the child achieves competence or capacity.

### 6 **What is <sup>a</sup> 'looked after child' under English Law?**

- Children are described as being 'looked after' by the local authority (LA) when either:
  - a) they have been made the subject of a care order by a family court, which obliges the local authority to look after the child;
  - b) the local authority provides the child with accommodation, in the absence of a care order.
- In both cases, the child's local authority passport, generally provided by the foster parent should make clear into which category the child falls. Clearly, children who are a subject of a care order will usually also be accommodated by the local authority.
- The existence of the care order is of great importance, since it directs the local authority to share parental responsibility for the child with the parent(s), who before the start of the order had parental responsibility for the child. Since only those with parental responsibility for the child can provide consent for his or her treatment, it is vital to ascertain which adults hold parental responsibility.
- If no care order is in place, consent needs to be sought from the parents.
- If an order is in place, the local authority passport will indicate whether the local authority has restricted the scope of the birth parents' parental responsibility. If they continue to bear parental responsibility for medical decisions, they can provide consent. If the local authority appears to have restricted the parents from giving consent, advice should be sought.

### 7 **Who can provide consent for surgery?**

• A person with parental responsibility has the right to provide consent where necessary. The child's mother (the woman who gave birth to the baby, but not the person who provided the egg from which

- he/she was conceived, if different) automatically has parental responsibility.
- The child's father gains parental responsibility automatically if married at the time of the birth registration. Since 2003, unmarried fathers also get parental responsibility automatically, when they register the birth.
- Alternatively, parental responsibility can be later acquired by the unmarried father, either with the agreement of the child's mother, by application to a court or by marrying the mother.
- Parental responsibility is passed to adoptive parents on legal adoption. It may be shared with guardians appointed by parents or with local authorities, and is linked to various legal orders.

#### 8 **How does the parent decide whether to provide consent?**

- The person with parental responsibility who provides consent for a child's surgery must act in the child's best interests in so doing. These interests are usually self-evident, and the agreement between parents and surgeon is reached after full disclosure of the relevant information.
- This agreement is not invariable. In a case concerning a child with biliary atresia, the clinicians wished to perform a liver transplant, and considered the prospects of success to be good. The parents refused their consent, on the grounds that the surgery was not in the child's best interests. The Court of Appeal held that the assessment of the child's best interests went wider than the narrower medical best interests, and that the child's connection with his family held great weight in this regard. Accordingly, the Court refused to enforce the hospital's request that the mother would bring her child in for surgery. The judgement could be criticised, in failing to differentiate between the interests of the child and those of his mother.
- The case, however, provides an example of the balancing act performed by courts.

#### 9 **Can children under <sup>16</sup> provide consent independent of their parents?**

- Depending on their maturity and the intervention that is proposed, children from a young age may be able to provide independent consent. For example, a 4-year-old child may be able to consent to a blood pressure measurement, a 6-year-old to a venepuncture and a 10-year-old to the removal of a chest drain.
- There is no suggesting that the parents should be excluded from this process and such an exclusion should be avoided, if possible. It is

for the family as a whole to decide what part the child's potential competence should play in the consenting process. But the involvement of children in this process will strengthen the therapeutic relationship and is to be encouraged.

- A child's previous experience is of great importance.
- It is submitted that following the very recent diagnosis of structural cardiac disease in a 15-year-old, who has been asymptomatic up to this point, the child will be so horrified by the dissolution of his comfortable and well organised life as to be incoherent, likely incapable of consenting for the necessary cardiac catheter investigations.
- By contrast, another 15-year-old has been teetering on the brink of cardiac failure for many years. He has already undergone multiple cardiac interventions, including a sternal dehiscence 3 years ago. He knows a great deal about cardiac surgery and has seen its complications and disadvantages wreak havoc in his congenital cardiac peer group. Now facing his transplant, it is possible he will be competent to provide independent consent.
- Therefore, it is important objectively to determine whether a child of 15 years or younger has the necessary experience to inform his or her competence to provide independent consent for the proposed intervention.

#### 10 **How is the competence of <sup>a</sup> child younger than <sup>16</sup> established?**

- For this assessment, the Gillick test is widely used.
- The test derives from a landmark case where it was established that a child who is competent to provide consent should be allowed to do so, independently of their parents.
- The test requires that the child has sufficient understanding and intelligence to enable him or her to understand fully what is involved in a proposed intervention. Thus, if a child can understand:
  - a) that a choice exists;
  - b) the nature and purpose of the procedure;
  - c) the risks and side effects;
  - d) the alternatives to the procedure;
  - e) and is able to:
    - i) retain the information long enough;
    - ii) weigh the information;
    - iii) arrive at a decision;
    - iv) and to be free from undue pressure.

Then he or she would be deemed competent for the proposed intervention. It will be seen that competence rests on intelligence, maturity and experience. Not on age.

- Gillick provides a high threshold for consent, consistent with public policy. It would be highly undesirable to allow incompetent children to provide consent for interventions which they could not fully understand.
- The fact that a child has to 'prove' their competence places a barrier to children that is never experienced by adults, whose capacity is presumed.

#### 11 **Is 'Fraser' competence synonymous with 'Gillick' competence?**

- During the Gillick case, an additional set of guidelines were suggested by Lord Fraser, specifically for doctors who assist with reproductive decision-making by children under 16.
- It should be noted that these do not replace the Gillick test, nor are they synonymous with it.

### 12 **Can <sup>a</sup> Gillick competent child refuse treatment?**

- The vast majority of Gillick competent children who refuse treatment are refusing relatively trivial procedures. You may be entitled to rely upon their parent's consent if necessary, but it is a matter for clinical judgement whether the procedure could be deferred, to allow the child further time to consider, and be reconciled with what is likely to be an inevitable outcome. (The problem of refusal in Gillick competent children is dealt with in the same way as for the 16- and 17-year age group, below.)
- The Gillick competent child, however, does not enjoy an equal right to refuse treatment. Only those cases in which the refusal of lifesaving treatments in these children is at issue have reached the court. Given the opportunity, courts have resolutely denied the (otherwise) competent minor the right to choose death:
  - a) A 15-year-old girl refusing her consent for a life-saving heart transplant had her refusal overridden by the courts. M's reason was that she "…would rather die than have the transplant and have someone else's heart. …I would feel different with someone else's heart… that's a good enough reason not to have a heart transplant, even if it saved my life…" Nevertheless, balancing the child's undoubted resentment against the certainty of her death in the absence of a transplant, the court was obliged to act in her best interests, and keep her alive. Accordingly, the court authorised the operation;

b) In another case, a 14-year-old girl required a blood transfusion. She was a Jehovah's Witness, and refused the treatment. The court found that even if she had been Gillick competent, her grave condition would have led the court to authorise the transfusion. As it was, the girl was unaware of the manner of death from anaemia and was basing her views on those of her congregation, rather than on her own experiences. For these reasons, she was judged incompetent to make this decision for herself.

### 13 Can young people provide independent consent?

- People of 16 and 17 years of age are presumed to have the capacity to provide consent for surgical, medical and dental treatment.
- Made possible by the Family Law Reform Act 1969, this recognised that the 'lifestyle' decisions that teenagers were taking in that era contrasted sharply with the age of majority (21 years) at the time. The new law reduced the age of majority to 18 years, and introduced the notion that 16- and 17-year-olds had *legal capacity*. This was built upon by the Mental Capacity Act 2005, which provided the presumption of *mental capacity* for this age group.
- Young people are thus able to provide consent for treatment in the absence of their parents. However, the parental right to provide consent for treatment lasts until the end of childhood. This has the effect of providing a 'safety net', allowing 16- and 17-year-olds the opportunity of consent for themselves or deferring to parents if they see fit.
- Once these children reach adulthood on their 18th birthday, all parents' rights disappear. For the rest of their life, they alone can provide consent, either directly in person, or in some circumstances, by a proxy method.

## 14 How to deal with a young person who wishes to have a treatment with which her parents disagree?

- If parents and a child of this age disagree, it is wise to exercise caution.
- If a 16- or 17-year-old wishes to exercise his or her right to consent, whilst parents oppose the decision, then one would be entitled to rely on this consent.
- However, it would be important to understand the basis for their disagreement. For instance, if one suspected that the young person was not capacitous, the presumption (that the child's consent could be relied upon) should be challenged. This can simply be done by establishing whether all the relevant information is properly understood, and that information can be retained, believed and weighed up. Finally, that a decision could be appropriately communicated. If the young person can, then he or she has capacity.

• But it is still wise to tease out where the problem lies, since this is a most unusual situation, and it would be in the young person's best interests to resolve the issue before surgery, if that is feasible.

#### 15 **How to deal with <sup>a</sup> young person who refuses <sup>a</sup> treatment that his parents wish him to have?**

- The problem, reversed, is of a young person who refuses treatment but who is accompanied by a parent who provides consent. Valid parental consent will make the procedure 'legal' but clinical judgement should be exercised as to whether proceeding with the treatment against the young person's wishes is both practicable and in his or her best interests. Modern English law views parental responsibility as a dwindling right, steadily eroded by the maturing child's increasing autonomy.
- For elective procedures, it is recommended that these should be abandoned until the dispute is resolved.
- For emergency or life-saving procedures, alternative ways to administer treatment that are still consistent with the young person's best interests should be explored. However, if life or limbs were under threat, and there was no valid alternative choice but to provide a definitive operation, then reluctantly, restrain and proceed could be the only way forward. A postoperative embolism that has resulted in an ischaemic hand could be an example of this situation. It should be noted that in reality, the amount of resistance that a child of any age puts up is usually inversely proportional to their malaise and discomfort. In the gravely ill, refusal is rare.
- For urgent procedures, if a 16- or 17-year-old refuses treatment for the preservation of her life, such as the transfusion of blood, courts invariably choose to override the child's autonomy and provide an order which allows lawful provision of the treatment against the child's wishes. This either upholds the parental wishes for treatment or overrides parental refusal. Although these cases are rare, the timescale within which the decision needs to be made allows sufficient time for the court to be contacted, providing the surgeon with the necessary authority.

#### 16 **Does the young person's right to consent extend to research activities?**

- The 1969 law did not extend this right to consent for research or interventions that do not potentially provide a direct health benefit to the individual concerned.
- However, if competent along 'Gillick' lines, a young person may be able to provide consent for these activities.

#### 17 **How can consent be obtained from 'incapacitated adult patients' requiring interventions for congenital heart disease?**

- All patients who are 18 years or over are presumed to have capacity.
- Where there is a suspicion that the adult about to give consent lacks capacity, that presumption may be rebutted if, on the basis of the Mental Capacity Act 2005, it has been established that they lack capacity to make the relevant decision; for instance, the decision to agree or refuse cardiac surgery.
- Both the local trust's mandatory training or that of the General Medical Council are helpful and ubiquitous sources of information concerning the use of the Mental Capacity Act 2005.
- If the adult in question has capacity, it is important to realise that no consent can be provided from any source. In most situations, there will be universal agreement between the family, friends, acquaintances, doctors and nurses that the procedure is in the best interest of the patient. In this common situation, it will be completely acceptable to proceed on this basis. Although no consent will be available, the procedure will be lawful if performed in the patient's best interests.
- However, there are circumstances in which despite universal agreement, the Court of Protection should be consulted, including:
  - a) organ donation;
  - b) non-therapeutic sterilisation of incapacitated adults;
  - c) foreseeable necessity for forceful restraint;
  - d) use of treatments that are innovative or experimental, or involve an ethical dilemma.
- If the incapacitated adult is unbefriended, with no accompanying persons, the Mental Capacity Act 2005 insists that an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate should be nominated, to ensure that the patient's circumstances have been subject to all reasonable scrutiny, before the best interests of the patient can be determined.
- In the unusual circumstances where there is dissent from any quarter, then resolving the dispute before proceeding is strongly advised. If the dispute cannot be transformed into an agreement from the dissonant parties, (irrespective of whether they are clinical or family) then a declaration from the Court of Protection will be required.
- There are circumstances where patients may, during an adult era of capacity, have made advanced decisions (that anticipate their own incapacity) to refuse treatment. If such a decision exists, then advice should be sought.

- Equally, the capacitous adult may have created a lasting power of attorney, embodied in a friend or relative (donee), to be activated by the advent of their incapacity, authorising the donee to give or refuse consent to the carrying out or continuation of a treatment on their behalf. In these circumstances, advice should be sought.
- Less likely, the Court of Protection may have appointed a deputy to make decisions on behalf of the incapacitated patient but it is unlikely to have given the deputy powers to make medical decisions, since the courts prefer to reserve these difficult decisions for themselves.
- Social services have no role in the provision or withholding of consent in this group of patients.

#### 18 **Why is it necessary to disclose information when seeking consent?**

- Clinicians must supply the patient or parent with enough information to make an informed decision as to whether they wish to undergo the proposed intervention.
- This is entirely separate from the need to ensure that patients are not subjected to an unwanted touch.
- Whilst training ensures that surgeons are acutely aware of surgical hazards, our patients are not. As a consequence, doctors often fail to appreciate how little patients understand about the consequences of intervention. Examples are numerous, including:
  - a) probably only a few patients appreciate that surgery on their back may lead them to urinary and faecal incontinence, or failure to move their legs;
  - b) that misdirection of a subclavian needle may lead to a thoracotomy, to arrest the haemorrhage thus caused;
  - c) that a difficult inguinal hernia repair could lead to loss of the ipsilateral testicle.
- The process of consent, with disclosure of risks and side effects, is designed to allow patients an insight into the risks that they and the surgeon jointly face. Furthermore, patients cannot be expected to anticipate the limitations of treatment or the possible alternatives.
- Disclosing alternatives to treatment may be very important to a patient who is otherwise unaware that they had a choice; for example:
  - a) a man facing excision of pulmonary metastases from osteosarcoma may be blissfully unaware that cure is unlikely. If he had known, he might have chosen an alternative route and avoided thoracic intervention;

b) a woman planning on going to her daughter's wedding tomorrow might just elect, tonight, to have her acute appendicitis treated only with antibiotics, at least for 24 hours, and take the risk.

### 19 **What should be disclosed when seeking consent?**

- Most hospitals provide consent forms that guide the clinician as to what should be discussed, broadly categorised as the benefits and disadvantages of the proposed operation, together with the benefits and disadvantages of alternative treatments, including those of no treatment at all (Figure 1).
- This position was articulated in the case of Pearce v United Bristol Healthcare NHST, 48 BMLR 118, and provided the foundations for the standards for disclosure of risk:
  - "If there is a significant risk which would affect the judgement of a reasonable patient, then in the normal course it is the responsibility of a doctor to inform the patient of that significant risk, if the information is needed so that the patient can determine for him or herself as to what course he or she should adopt."
  - This judgement, with some embellishment, was adopted in Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board, UKSC 11.
- This judgement was reflected by the General Medical Council in 2008, which emphasised the importance of a discussion that leads to consent, rather than a soliloquy delivered by a surgeon.
- The legal prescription for the necessary disclosure was provided by the Supreme Court in 2015, after a woman claimed that she would have chosen a Caesarean section if it had been offered to her, thereby avoiding neurological injury to her son. In this fundamental case (Montgomery v Lanarkshire, 2015), the Supreme Court took the opportunity to endorse and confirm various strands of previously decided court decisions, pertaining to the disclosure of information to patients prior to seeking their consent for surgery.
- In so doing, the Supreme Court reiterated existing advice from the General Medical Council. These various aspects of consent law in England are set out in all the following sections.
- The doctor is under a duty to take reasonable care to ensure that the patient is aware of any material risks involved in any recommended treatment, and of any reasonable alternatives or variant treatment. The test of materiality is whether, in the circumstances of the particular case, a reasonable person in the patient's position would be likely to attach significance to the risk, or the doctor is or should be aware that the particular patient would be likely to attach significance to it (Figures and 4).

#### Guidance to health professionals (to be read in conjunction with consent policy)

#### What a consent form is for

This form documents the patient's agreement to go ahead with the investigation or treatment you have proposed. It is not a legal waiver — if patients, for example, do not receive enough information on which to base their decision, then the consent may not be valid, even though the form has been signed. Patients are also entitled to change their mind after signing the form, if they retain capacity to do so. The form should act as an aide-memoire to health professionals and patients, by providing a check-list of the kind of information patients should be offered, and by enabling the patient to have a written record of the main points discussed. In no way, however, should the written information provided for the patient be regarded as a substitute for face-to-face discussions with the patient.

#### The law on consent

See the Department of Health's Reference guide to consent for examination or treatment for a comprehensive summary of the law on consent (also available at <a href="https://www.doh.gov.uk/consent">www.doh.gov.uk/consent</a>).

#### Who can give consent

Everyone aged 16 or more is presumed to have capacity to give consent for themselves, unless the opposite is demonstrated. If a child under the age of 16 has "sufficient understanding and intelligence to enable him or her to understand fully what is proposed", then he or she will have capacity to give consent for himself or herself. Young people aged 16 and 17, and legally 'competent' younger children, may therefore sign this form for themselves, but may like a parent to countersign as well. If the child is not able to give consent for himself or herself, some-one with parental responsibility may do so on their behalf and a separate form is available for this purpose. Even where a child is able to give consent for himself or herself, you should always involve those with parental responsibility in the child's care, unless the child specifically asks you not to do so. If a patient has capacity to give consent but is physically unable to sign a form, you should complete this form as usual, and ask an independent witness to confirm that the patient has given consent orally or non-verbally.

#### When NOT to use this form

If the patient is 18 or over and lacks the capacity to give consent, you should use form 4 (form for adults who lack the capacity to consent to investigation or treatment) instead of this form. A patient lacks capacity if they have an impairment of the mind or brain or disturbance affecting the way their mind or brain works and they cannot:

- understand information about the decision to be made
- · retain that information in their mind
- · use or weigh that information as part of the decision-making process, or
- · communicate their decision (by talking, using sign language or any other means).

You should always take all reasonable steps (for example involving more specialist colleagues) to support a patient in making their own decision, before concluding that they are unable to do so.

Relatives **cannot** be asked to sign a form on behalf of an adult who lacks capacity to consent for themselves, unless they have been given the authority to do so under a Lasting Power of Attorney or as a court appointed deputy.

#### Information

Information about what the treatment will involve, its benefits and risks (including side-effects and complications) and the alternatives to the particular procedure proposed, is crucial for patients when making up their minds. The courts have stated that patients should be told about 'significant risks which would affect the judgement of a reasonable patient.' 'Significant' has not been legally defined, but the GMC requires doctors to tell patients about 'serious or frequently occurring' risks. In addition if patients make clear they have particular concerns about certain kinds of risk, you should make sure they are informed about these risks, even if they are very small or rare. You should always answer questions honestly. Sometimes, patients may make it clear that they do not want to have any information about the options, but want you to decide on their behalf. In such circumstances, you should do your best to ensure that the patient receives at least very basic information about what is proposed. Where information is refused, you should document this on page 1 of the form or in the patient's note.

#### Statement of patient

Please read this form carefully. If your treatment has been planned in advance, you should already have your own copy of page 1 which describes the benefits and risks of the proposed treatment. If not, you will be offered a copy now. If you have any further questions, do ask - we are here to help you. You have the right to change your mind at any time, including after you have signed this form.

I agree to the procedure or course of treatment described on this form.

I agree to the use of photography for the purposes of diagnosis and treatment

I agree to photographs being used for medical teaching

I understand that you cannot give me a guarantee that a particular person will perform the procedure. The person will, however, have appropriate experience.

I understand that I will have the opportunity to discuss the details of anaesthesia with an anaesthetist before the procedure, unless the urgency of my situation prevents this. (This only applies to patients having general or regional anaesthesia.)

I understand that any procedure in addition to those described on this form will only be carried out if it is necessary to save my life or to prevent serious harm to my health.

I understand that any tissue removed as part of the procedure or treatment may be used for diagnosis, stored or disposed of as appropriate and in a manner regulated by appropriate, ethical, legal and professional standards

\*I agree that tissue removed and the results of diagnostic tests, may be used for teaching, audit and ethically approved research which could benefit other patients (including genetic research and research by commercial companies) \*Delete as appropriate

| I have been told about additional procedures which may become necessary during my treatment. I have listed below any procedures which I do not wish to be carried out without further discussion |                                    |  |

#### 20 **To what extent is dialogue with the patient or parents required?**

• When concerning the consent process, dialogue is mandatory. Both courts and regulators consider open discussion between clinician and patients to be of the greatest importance.

### 21 **Is there an exception to the imperative for disclosure prior to consent?**

- There is an exception to the imperative of disclosure, but it is highly restrictive. The court in Montgomery acknowledged the rare situation where the disclosure would be seriously detrimental to the patient's health. Plainly, this exception primarily refers to the health of a person making a decision about their own treatment, so would be unlikely to apply to a parent.
- Nevertheless, it is foreseeable that adults suffering from congenital cardiac disease might fall into the category where disclosure would seriously harm their health. This 'therapeutic exception', however, should be used only with great caution and would require a second opinion, as a matter of urgency.

#### 22 **How do courts deal with patients' claims that insufficient information was disclosed to allow an informed decision?**

- It is very unusual for cases where patients claim that they were not provided with valid disclosure (and thus their consent was invalid) to reach court. When this happens, however, English courts do not rely on expert witnesses to set the standard for what the appropriate disclosure should have been.
- The trend is in contradistinction to the great majority of clinical negligence cases, where a medical expert will be asked to set the standard of care, against which the defendant doctor will be judged. But it also gives an insight into the importance that the judiciary set on disclosure for consent. Judges tend to put themselves in the shoes of the 'reasonable' patient and enquire what such a person would want to know, before giving consent in the particular set of clinical circumstances.

#### 23 **What should be the appropriate course of action if doubts remain that a proposed elective operation is appropriate?**

- Seeking consent from a person who is fully aware of the clinical risks and benefits should concentrate the mind of both surgeon and patient.
- If the process has failed to dispel doubts in either mind that intervention is the right thing to do, the procedure should be abandoned, the situation should be reconsidered, and a different course should be pursued.
- At any stage, seeking a colleague's opinion, promoting discussion at multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings and a pro-active stance towards obtaining a formal second opinion are valid strategies to reach a consensus and obtaining consent.

### 24 **What is the role of multidisciplinary team deliberations in congenital cardiac surgery?**

- In the NHS, there is no legal provision for shared responsibility. Each patient is treated under the name of an identified consultant, who in the first instance bears responsibility for the patient's outcome.
- Any conclusions reached and advice given following an MDT discussion will have been based on individual contributions by the specialists within the group. If the MDT conclusions or advice are later challenged, a record of these contributions needs to be available to assess whether the individual contributions were reasonable.
- It is foreseeable that an MDT might reach a majority conclusion that a particular procedure or operation is in the best interests of the patient but the consultant surgeon to whom the patient is now referred to disagrees with this proposal. The surgeon should make this known to the MDT, giving reasons. On no account should a surgeon perform an operation which they believe to be counter to the patient's interests. When an agreement cannot be reached, it is advisable to consider the opinion or intervention of a surgeon colleague.
- In any case, the disclosure of information prior to seeking consent is the responsibility of the surgeon who is going to perform the procedure. Whilst the sum of the information in relation to benefits, risks and alternatives may reflect advice garnered at an MDT, the 'consenting' surgeon carries all the responsibility for the choices they make when selecting what information to disclose.

#### 25 **How should information be disclosed to <sup>a</sup> pregnant mother?**

- Anything which is not proscribed by English law is lawful.
- No laws prevent pregnant women from hang-gliding, bungee jumping, taking drugs, smoking or driving in F1 racing cars, although all of these activities may be highly prejudicial to the mother and her baby. Equally, if a woman with congenital heart disease wishes to run the risk that pregnancy might pose to her own health, she is entitled to do so and a matter only for her to decide upon. In fact, this decision falls outside the remit of consent for medical treatment, since the conception is usually achieved without medical assistance.
- It has to be very clear that the responsibility of carrying the risk to her own health and that of the unborn child remains with the mother.
- This is because until the baby is born and has a separate existence from the mother, it has no legal personality and is considered a part of the mother. Therefore, child protection laws do not apply to a foetus. There are examples of women whose rights to refuse caesarean section despite the certain consequent death of their baby have been steadfastly upheld by English courts.
- Reasonable steps, however, need to be taken to inform the putative mother of the risks that she runs and if she requests information relating to the risk she plans to run, the consulting doctor must provide it.
- With respect to the health of her putative foetus, if a prospective mother with congenital heart disease seeks information regarding the wisdom of becoming pregnant, any and all risks to the foetus that derive either from her cardiac diagnosis (such as heritability) or her cardiac health must be disclosed, insofar as that may have a bearing on her ability to carry the baby to full term, or to adequately provide circulation to the unborn child.

#### 26 **What is the role of <sup>a</sup> numeric threshold in choosing what to disclose?**

- The assessment of whether a risk is 'material' cannot be reduced to percentages. The significance of a given risk will reflect not only its magnitude but also other factors. The nature of the risk, the effect which its occurrence would have upon the life of the patient, the importance to the patient of the benefits sought to be achieved by the treatment, the alternative therapies available and the risks involved in those alternatives, all play a part.
- This assessment therefore depends on the facts of the case and upon the characteristics of the patient. Basing a clinical decision

whether or not to disclose an operative risk solely upon whether or not it crosses a numerical threshold of.1 or 0.001 percent is arbitrary and unreasonable.
