#### Interrupted aortic arch

**Harold M. Burkhart**

- 1 **What is interrupted aortic arch?**
- Interrupted aortic arch (IAA) is a discontinuity in the lumen of the aortic arch.
- It accounts for 1.5% of all congenital heart disease.

#### 2 **What are the three anatomical segments of the aortic arch?**

- The proximal segment lies between the innominate artery and the left common carotid artery.
- The distal segment extends from the left common carotid artery to the left subclavian artery.
- The aortic isthmus is the area beyond the left subclavian artery to the proximal descending aorta in the area of the ductus arteriosus.

#### 3 **Describe the classification system used for interrupted aortic arch (Figure 1)**

• Type A — interruption at the isthmus.

- Type B interruption between the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery, which accounts for approximately twothirds of all IAA cases.
- Type C discontinuity between the innominate artery and the left common carotid artery, which is rare (<5% of cases).</li>

#### 4 What is the embryologic origin of the aortic arch?

- The proximal aortic arch develops from the aortic sac.
- The distal arch is derived from the 4th embryonic arch.
- The isthmus is derived from the junction of the 6th embryonic arch with the 4th embryonic arch and left dorsal aorta.
- Origins of the brachiocephalic vessel may be abnormal in IAA. The most common anomaly is an aberrant right subclavian artery arising from the proximal descending aorta.

## 5 What are the most common cardiac anomalies associated with an interrupted aortic arch?

- Ventricular septal defect (VSD, 72-85%).
- Truncus arteriosus (9-18%).
- Aortic valve stenosis (10%).
- Transposition of the great arteries (4-6%).
- Aortopulmonary window (3-5%).

### 6 What factors may contribute to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in interrupted aortic arch?

- Posterior malalignment of the conal septum relative to the VSD.
- Bicuspid aortic valve.
- Hypoplasia of the aortic annulus.
- Prominent muscle of Moulaert (Figure 2).

#### Which syndromes are associated with interrupted aortic arch?

 DiGeorge syndrome (22q11 deletion) is associated with IAA and occurs in 25-35% of patients. The syndrome is associated with hypocalcaemia, absent thymus, a low CD4 T-lymphocyte count and dysmorphic facial features.

#### 8 **What is the clinical presentation of <sup>a</sup> neonate with interrupted aortic arch?**

- The presentation of a neonate with IAA depends on the patency of the ductus arteriosus.
- If the ductus arteriosus closes, the neonate will present with poor perfusion in the lower half of the body, resulting in acidosis, renal and hepatic failure, and poor perfusion of the gut.
- If the ductus arteriosus remains open, the neonate will present with congestive heart failure, as the pulmonary resistance naturally drops allowing unrestricted pulmonary blood flow.

#### 9 **Describe the medical management of <sup>a</sup> neonate presenting with interrupted aortic arch**

- The primary goal of pre-operative medical management of a baby with IAA is maintenance of ductus arteriosus patency. This involves instituting intravenous prostaglandin.
- In the neonate, prostaglandin is able to maintain and also re-establish ductal patency.
- Ventilator management can also be utilised to decrease pulmonary blood flow and promote peripheral perfusion.

- High levels of oxygen and hyperventilation should be avoided.
- Prior to operating, the baby should be aggressively resuscitated with the correction of any acidosis, renal failure and hepatic failure.

### 10 What are the echocardiographic features of interrupted aortic arch?

- Echocardiography is the investigation of choice for the diagnosis of IAA to establish the:
  - a) site and distance of the interruption;
  - b) diameter of the aortic valve and ascending aorta;
  - c) presence of any VSD;
  - d) conal septal anatomy;
  - e) presence of any left ventricular outflow tract obstruction;
  - f) location of the aortic arch branches.

### Describe the use of other imaging modalities in a neonate with interrupted aortic arch

- Cardiac catheterisation is indicated where:
  - a) anatomy of the cardiac anomaly is unclear;

**Figure 3.** Magnetic resonance images of a Type C interrupted aortic arch from an: A) anterior view; and B) posterior view. CORSA = cervical origin of the right subclavian artery; LCCA = left common carotid artery; LSCA = left subclavian artery; PDA = patent ductus arteriosus; RSCA = right subclavian artery; RCCA = right common carotid artery; IAA = interrupted aortic arch; Desc Ao = descending aorta.

- b) cardiac intervention is required for an associated cardiac anomaly, such as balloon septostomy in associated transposition of the great arteries;
- c) postoperatively, to assess the aortic arch and intervene, if necessary.
- Magnetic resonance imaging (Figure 3) and computed tomography with 3D reconstruction can be helpful in defining the arch anatomy and relationships of surrounding vascular structures.

### 12 What are the surgical options for a neonate with interrupted aortic arch?

- Following resuscitation of the neonate, surgical repair should be undertaken. This can be achieved as a:
  - a) one-stage approach where the arch is reconstructed and the VSD is closed in one surgical procedure;
  - b) two-stage approach where the arch is reconstructed via a left thoracotomy or median sternotomy and a pulmonary artery band is placed, if the VSD is non-restrictive. The VSD is repaired at the time of the second operation.

### 13 Describe the principles of cardiopulmonary bypass for a one-stage repair of interrupted aortic arch

- Following median sternotomy, the thymus is excised.
- The aorta and all arch vessels are identified and controlled (Figure 4).
- An arterial cannula is usually inserted directly into the ascending aorta. Alternatively, a 3.5mm graft may be sutured to the innominate artery (Figure 5). The graft can then be cannulated, keeping the cannula out of the ascending aorta and allows for low-flow cerebral perfusion during arch reconstruction.
- A second arterial cannula, employed to maximise body cooling, is inserted into the main pulmonary artery or ductus arteriosus. Both arterial cannulae are connected together in a Y-configuration into the arterial line of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit.
- Bicaval cannulation is usually employed for venous drainage to allow for VSD repair. Alternatively, a single venous cannula may be employed and the VSD repair performed with hypothermic circulatory arrest.
- The pulmonary arteries are controlled once cardiopulmonary bypass is instituted. The patient is cooled to 18°C and the heart is arrested with cardioplegia.

A right atrial cannula completes the circuit. PTFE = polytetrafluorethylene; PDA = patent ductus arteriosus; RA = right atrium.**

#### 14 **Describe the principles of aortic arch reconstruction in interrupted aortic arch**

- Once the temperature has reached deep hypothermia, the ductus arteriosus is ligated and divided.
- The arch reconstruction is carried out under hypothermic circulatory arrest or utilising low-flow cerebral perfusion via the innominate artery and when possible, coronary perfusion to avoid cardiac arrest (Figure 6).

**Figure 6. Operative images demonstrating: A) division of the ductus arteriosus; and B) institution of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA), with regional perfusion to the cerebral and coronary circulations.**

- The aortic arch components are completely mobilised. Often, this involves dividing the left subclavian artery or an aberrant right subclavian artery. The distance between the two components of the arch is assessed to decide on the type of repair, either direct anastomosis or augmented patch repair (Figure 7).
- An incision is made on the left lateral aspect of the distal ascending aorta. All ductal tissue is resected from the distal aortic arch. When the two ends are close enough, they are sutured together with a fine monofilament suture (Figure 8).
- A patch may be used anteriorly to augment the anastomosis (Figure 9).

#### 15 **Describe the principles of ventricular septal defect repair in patients with interrupted aortic arch**

- A patch is typically utilised to repair the VSD.
- If the conal septum is well developed, the surgical approach is via the right atrium.
- If there is hypoplasia of the conal septum, the VSD may be better approached through a transverse incision in the main pulmonary artery (Figure 10).

### 16 What can be done if severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction is present with interrupted aortic arch?

- If adequate sized ventricles are present and the VSD is unrestrictive, a two-ventricle repair is still an option, even in the face of severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO).
- A Damus-Kaye-Stansel reconstruction of the ascending aorta and main pulmonary artery can be performed. The VSD can be baffled to include the pulmonary valve. A right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit is then performed (Yasui operation).
- This can be done in stages, waiting to close the VSD after growth in a borderline left ventricle.

### 17 What are the possible early complications of interrupted aortic arch repair?

- Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury.
- Phrenic nerve injury.
- Persistent aortic arch obstruction.
- Left bronchial obstruction.
- Atrioventricular block (following VSD repair).

### 18 What are the outcomes following interrupted aortic arch repair?

- The early mortality for a one-stage repair is approximately 10%, with the 1- and 5-year survival 75-80% and 70-75%, respectively.
- The 18-year freedom from aortic arch obstruction is 46%.
