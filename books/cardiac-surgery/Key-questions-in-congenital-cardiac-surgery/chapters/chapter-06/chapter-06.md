# Congenital angiography and catheter interventions

**Jenny E. Zablah, Neil Wilson**

- 1 **What are the factors that may contribute to higher radiation exposure on patients undergoing cardiac catheterisation?**
- Factors such as age, body size, distance between the X-ray generator and the body, length of the study and frame rate of fluoroscopy and image acquisition contribute to the level of exposure.
- Tactics to decrease radiation dose and improve image quality include:
  - a) adequate positioning, with patients iso-centred and straight on the table;
  - b) using the lowest acceptable frame rate during pulsed fluoroscopy and cine angiography;
  - c) avoid exposing unnecessary body parts, such as arms and skull from the field;
  - d) using the lowest acceptable magnification mode;
  - e) using collimators and filters;
  - f) centring the region of interest correctly in the field;
  - g) keeping the image intensifier as close to the patient as possible and the X-ray tube as far away as possible;
  - h) using the angiographic projection that reduces operator exposure;
  - i) minimising beam-on time;
  - j) removing anti-scatter grids when catheterising small children (<20kg).

#### 2 **What are the potential hazard factors of higher radiation exposure during cardiac catheterisation?**

- Radiation-induced skin reaction which may not appear until weeks after exposure, where:
  - a) the threshold for mild transient skin erythema is 2Gy;
  - b) erythema and hair loss are expected with peak skin doses exceeding 6Gy;
  - c) doses of 10-15Gy may cause telangiectasis and chronic skin changes;
  - d) higher exposure may cause skin ulceration.
- Radiation eye injury where high doses of radiation can damage the conjunctiva, iris, sclera and blood vessels of the retina. The lens may sustain irreversible damage from a relatively low dose of radiation with resulting formation of cataracts. For this reason, operators are advised to wear protective goggles.
- Malignancy where there is no clear exposure threshold for the development of malignancy after radiation exposure. This is defined as a stochastic effect, which is nevertheless dose-related. Most radiation-induced damage is rapidly repaired but occasional misrepair of DNA breaks can result in point mutations, chromosomal translocations and gene fusions linked to the induction of cancer. The organs with higher risk include the brain, skin and thyroid. For this reason, operators are advised to wear a full body shield, and a thyroid shield.

#### 3 **What are the commonest two-dimensional biplane angiographic projections used for congenital heart disease?**

- The main goal with any view is to get an axial, non-overlapped or nonforeshortened profile of the chamber or vessel in question.
- In the angiographic interrogation of congenital heart disease, many different projections may be needed in the context of situs, position of the heart and the underlying anatomy.
- There are several recommended projections for specific defects but the choice of a set of projections will depend upon the information required, equipment capabilities and personal operator preferences (Table 1 and Figure 1).

#### 4 **Describe the principles of three-dimensional rotational angiography**

- Three-dimensional rotational angiography (3DRA) is used in the guidance of various transcatheter therapies, including but not exclusive to percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation, coarctation stent placement, anatomical evaluation of single-ventricle palliation, pulmonary artery anatomy and others.
- Rotational angiographic images are acquired with C-arm rotation in the axial plane over seconds (depending on the system).
- During the C-arm rotation, a timed contrast injection is performed to uniformly opacify the vascular anatomy for the duration of the image acquisition.
- This image is dynamic and demonstrates cardiac structures in a three-dimensional perspective that allows measurements to be made throughout the cardiac cycle and may be used as reference imaging for interventions (Figure 2).

![](_page_3_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Figure 2. Three-dimensional angiographic reconstructions demonstrating a: A) transverse arch aneurysm (\*); and B) ascending aortic compression with balloon inflation in the right ventricular outflow tract during coronary artery assessment in the preparation for transcatheter pulmonary valve intervention.**

• The reconstruction of the 3D image volume set occurs immediately after the rotation is complete, requiring <30 seconds to be generated but it will still require manual work to optimise the information obtained.

- These reconstruction images, once generated, can be rotated in 3D to determine the optimal views of the anatomy of interest.
- 3D image fusion software is available which extends the 3DRA technology to use pre-registered computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging datasets. This allows live guidance of an interventional procedure with a 3D roadmap overlay with or without marking points (Figure 3). These different resources and technologies may reduce contrast and radiation exposure and result in shorter procedural times.

RBCA = right brachiocephalic artery; LCCA = left common carotid artery; LSCA = left subclavian artery.**

- 5 **What are the characteristics of <sup>a</sup> normal right atrial waveform and causes of an abnormal right atrial tracing?**
- The normal mean right atrial (RA) pressure is 2-8mmHg. There are two major positive waves (a and v) and two negative descents (x and y) (Figure 4).
- The a wave results from right atrial contraction, follows the P wave on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) and usually is the dominant wave. It may be absent in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter.

![](_page_5_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 4. Right atrial pressure waveform.**

- The v wave results from an increase in right atrial pressure during right ventricular systole and is generated by passive venous filling of the atrium while the tricuspid valve is closed. The peak of the wave follows the T wave in the surface ECG.
- A c wave (3rd wave) is occasionally present and follows the a wave by the same time as the PR interval on the ECG. It represents a rise in pressure due to ventricular contraction and bulging of the closed tricuspid valve.
- The x descent represents the pressure decline following atrial contraction due to atrial relaxation.
- The y descent is the result of a fall in pressure due to the opening of the tricuspid valve and the beginning of rapid ventricular filling.
- Several conditions alter the shape and position of these waves, including a:
  - a) cannon a wave which is seen in A-V asynchrony, such as complete heart block, when the atrium contracts against a tricuspid valve that is held closed by right ventricular systole;

- b) elevated a wave which is found in cases of restricted atrial emptying into the right ventricle, such as tricuspid atresia or stenosis, and when there is decreased right ventricular compliance from any cause;
- c) elevated v wave which is found in right ventricular failure, severe tricuspid regurgitation and patients with reduced atrial compliance (restrictive physiology);
- d) increased c wave which is found in patients with AV block;
- e) prominent x descent which may suggest constrictive physiology or right ventricular ischaemia;
- f) blunted x descent which may be seen in patients with atrial fibrillation;
- g) prominent y descent which is seen in constrictive pericarditis and restrictive myopathy;
- h) blunted y descent which is found in tamponade and right ventricular ischaemia.

#### 6 **What are the characteristics of the right ventricular pressure waveform?**

- The right ventricular (RV) pressure tracing normally exhibits a peak systolic pressure equal to that in the main pulmonary artery and ranges between 15-30mmHg. The right atrial and the right ventricular end-diastolic pressures (RVEDP) are equal, usually between 2- 8mmHg.
- The RV waveform consists of a systolic and diastolic curve (Figure 5). During right ventricular systole, the pressure rapidly rises with resulting closure of the tricuspid valve and opening of the pulmonary valve with blood exiting the chamber. The systolic waveform is rapid in upstroke and occurs immediately after the QRS complex on the surface ECG. At the end of systole, the ventricular relaxation begins and as the pressure falls below pulmonary artery pressure, the pulmonary valve closes.
- Right ventricular diastole generates three waveforms:
  - a) early rapid-filling wave which occurs at tricuspid valve opening;
  - b) slower-filling period;
  - c) right atrial systole which produces an a wave that is identical to the a wave in the atrial pressure tracing, with the end of the a wave corresponding to the right ventricular enddiastolic pressure (RVEDP). Atrial systole accounts for 25% of right ventricular diastolic filling.

![](_page_7_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 5. Right ventricular pressure waveform. RVEDP = right ventricular end-diastolic pressure.**

## 7 **What is the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure?**

- The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is obtained during right heart catheterisation and is an occluded pressure reflecting downstream left atrial pressure (Figure 6).
- In the absence of pulmonary venous obstruction or mitral valve disease, the PCWP is a reflection, but not a direct measure, of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP).
- The normal waveform includes an:
  - a) a wave which represents atrial contraction;
  - b) v wave which represents left atrial filling during left ventricular contraction;
  - c) c wave which represents mitral valve closure but may not be seen on the PCWP tracing;
  - d) x descent which represents left atrial relaxation;
  - e) y descent which represents left ventricular diastole.

![](_page_8_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 6. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. LVDP = left ventricular diastolic pressure.**

- Normal PCWP ranges from 4 to 12mmHg.
- PCWP is measured during diagnostic cardiac catheterisation procedures but is also frequently measured in critical care patients using a Swan-Ganz catheter, which is a flow-directed catheter inserted without fluoroscopic guidance typically as part of pre-operative and postoperative management during cardiac surgery.

#### 8 **What are the characteristics of the aortic pressure waveform?**

- During ventricular contraction, pressure in the ascending aorta parallels left ventricular (LV) pressure. Once the aortic valve closes, the aortic pressure declines somewhat more slowly than the LV pressure. This reflects the capacitance of the aorta and is influenced by pressure waves from the thoracic aorta and its branches.
- The rate and magnitude of decline of the aortic pressure during diastole are dependent on a number of factors, including aortic valve integrity (aortic regurgitation), capacitance and resistance of the

- peripheral circulation, and the presence of abnormal aortopulmonary connections, such as a patent ductus arteriosus.
- Pulse pressure is defined as the systolic pressure minus the diastolic pressure.
- A diastolic aortic pressure lower than the pulse pressure signifies a widened pulse pressure, which may be caused by aortic valve regurgitation, a patent ductus arteriosus, ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm, large aortopulmonary collaterals, aortopulmonary window, peripheral vasodilation or arteriovenous malformations.
- Conversely, a reduced pulse pressure, defined as a pulse pressure less than 50% of the diastolic value, may be caused by tamponade, heart failure, cardiogenic shock and aortic stenosis.

#### 9 **Describe how pressure gradients are measured in the catheterisation laboratory**

• The most frequently utilised cardiac pressure data are the amplitudes of the measured pressures themselves and the pressure differences (gradients) between two adjacent areas, such as the ascending and descending aorta (Figure 7).

![](_page_9_Figure_8.jpeg)

**Figure 7. Left heart cardiac catheterisation pressure measurement demonstrating coarctation of the aorta characterised by a significant gradient on pulling back the catheter from the ascending aorta to the descending aorta. The gradient is calculated by comparing the systolic peak to peak pressures across the affected area.**

- Gradients between adjacent chambers or areas result from fixed or dynamic obstructions within or between chambers or vessels. The magnitude of the gradient generally reflects the severity of the obstruction.
- The pressures are measured using fluid-filled catheters and manometers calibrated to the patient's mid-chest height.
- Peak to peak systolic gradients measured in the catheterisation laboratory assess the difference between peak systolic pressures in two different adjacent chambers or areas.
- Echocardiographic Doppler measurements, however, assess the maximum instantaneous pressure gradient across sites which occurs before the peak pressures.
- Therefore, by default, a Doppler-derived pressure gradient is different (higher) than a catheter-derived peak to peak pressure gradient. For this reason, mean pressure gradients from both Doppler and cardiac catheterisation represent better comparison.
- It is important to understand that a Doppler-derived pressure gradient across an obstruction is not an 'overestimate'. It is obtained at a chronologically different time in the cardiac cycle than a peak to peak gradient measured by cardiac catheterisation.
- Furthermore, it is also important to appreciate that the vast majority of Doppler-derived gradients are measured on unsedated patients, whereas those at cardiac catheterisation are almost always measured on a sedated or anaesthetised patient, whose cardiac output is likely lower as a consequence.

#### 10 **What is the role of transoesophageal echocardiography in the context of cardiac catheterisation?**

- Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) is an imaging technique that helps with pre-operative assessment and intra-procedural guidance.
- It is most commonly used to guide sizing and device positioning in the closure of an atrial septal defect (ASD, Figure 8), patent foramen ovale (PFO) or ventricular septal defect (VSD).
- It is also used to guide transseptal puncture and closure of the left atrial appendage and mitral paravalvar leaks (PVLs).
- Less commonly, it is used to guide closure of and creation of Fontan baffle fenestrations.
- In recent years, it is the imaging of choice for reparative interventions on the mitral valve, such as the application of a MitraClip™ and similar devices.
- In patients weighing more 16kg, 3D TOE has been shown to be a useful tool to guide catheter manipulations in the right heart, thereby decreasing the exposure to radiation.

**Figure 8. Transoesophageal echocardiographic images demonstrating: A) flow across a large atrial septal defect; and B) no residual shunting after device closure of the defect.**

- 11 **What is the role of cardiac computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in the context of cardiac catheterisation?**
- Cardiac computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are commonly used for diagnostic anatomical and functional assessment of the heart prior to cardiac catheterisation and act as tools of triage (Figure 9).

![](_page_12_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 9. Computed tomography coronal image demonstrating dextrocardia, isomerism, right lung agenesis, right bronchus agenesis and a single branch left pulmonary artery following stenting of the ductus arteriosus.**

- These cross-sectional imaging techniques help limit angiography and diagnostic studies to reduce radiation exposure to the patient.
- Recently, cardiac CT and MRI images have been used in conjunction with fluoroscopy to guide cardiac interventions, such as stenting of coarctation of the aorta. This integration of multimodality imaging with fluoroscopy, known as fusion imaging, provides an alternative to traditional fluoroscopically-guided catheterisation.

### 12 **What are the general principles of aortic valvuloplasty?**

- Class I indications for aortic valvuloplasty include:
  - a) a newborn with duct-dependent, isolated valvular aortic stenosis (AS);
  - b) children with isolated valvular AS with depressed LV systolic function;
  - c) children with isolated valvular AS with a resting peak systolic valve gradient (by catheter) ≥50mmHg;
  - d) children with isolated valvular AS with a resting peak systolic valve gradient (by catheter) ≥40mmHg and symptoms of angina or syncope, or ischaemic ST-T wave changes on electrocardiography at rest or with exercise.

- Pre-procedural echocardiography provides the most accessible anatomical and physiological data on the morphology of the aortic valve, peak instantaneous and mean aortic valve gradient, aortic valve annulus diameter, aortic valve insufficiency and left ventricular function.
- It is important to consider that the severity of the aortic valve gradient may be underestimated in patients with impaired left ventricular function.
- The technique of aortic valvuloplasty includes:
  - a) general anaesthesia;
  - b) vascular access via the femoral artery but may also be obtained via the carotid artery (percutaneous or cutdown) or rarely the umbilical artery;
  - c) haemodynamic assessment to measure the aortic valve gradient;
  - d) aortic angiography to delineate the plane of the aortic valve which aids balloon positioning and demonstrate the presence or absence of regurgitation. Although some operators perform left ventricular angiography, this rarely adds to the procedure and may cause deleterious effects on left ventricular function;
  - e) measurement of the aortic annulus diameter to select the appropriate balloon diameter (Figure 10). The balloon to annulus ratio of approximately 0.8-0.9 is perceived to be appropriate and can be increased in 0.5 or 1mm increments until an acceptable result is obtained. Oversizing of the balloon obviously risks severe aortic regurgitation. Tyshak II ® (NuMED, Inc.) balloons are low profile and compliant, and are favoured for this procedure.
- The criteria for a successful valvuloplasty should be taken in context of the clinical scenario but broadly are:
  - a) >50% decrease in the pressure gradient across the aortic valve;
  - b) >25% increase in the aortic valve area;
  - c) mild or less aortic regurgitation.

#### 13 **What are the general principles of pulmonary valvuloplasty in isolated pulmonary stenosis?**

- Pulmonary valve stenosis may be isolated or as part of a complex of additional lesions, such as septal defects or associated with univentricular heart anatomy.
- Pulmonary valvuloplasty is indicated for a patient with:
  - a) critical pulmonary valve stenosis;
  - b) stenosis with a peak to peak catheter gradient >40mmHg or an echocardiographic peak instantaneous gradient >60mmHg;
  - c) clinically significant pulmonary valvular obstruction in the presence of RV dysfunction.
- The technique of pulmonary valvuloplasty includes:
  - a) general anaesthesia but can be performed under sedation in older patients;
  - b) vascular access via the femoral vein. At the discretion of the operator, an arterial line may be used to monitor the arterial blood pressure;

c) biplane right ventricular angiogram that is performed to confirm the site of the obstruction, to measure the pulmonary valve annulus diameter (Figure 11) and to evaluate the function of the right ventricle;

![](_page_15_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Figure 11. Angiographic evaluation of the pulmonary valve annulus in the lateral projection after a right ventricular angiogram demonstrating thickened pulmonary valve leaflets with the valve doming (asterisks). RV = right ventricle; RVOT = right ventricular outflow tract; MPA = main pulmonary artery; A = pulmonary valve annulus.**

- d) haemodynamic assessment of the pulmonary valve gradient;
- e) selection of the appropriate balloon size. Accepted practice is to use a balloon that is 1.2-1.4 times the diameter of the pulmonary valve annulus. Longer balloons give more stability during valvuloplasty, with 20mm-long balloons generally used in neonates and infants, 30mm-long balloons in children and 40mm-long balloons in adolescents and adults.
- Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty is generally a safe and effective procedure, with a low complication rate. Complications are more

- common in neonates or infants with the most severe pulmonary valve stenosis.
- Rare complications include right bundle branch block, femoral venous obstruction, injury to the tricuspid valve, pulmonary regurgitation and balloon rupture.
- A flow-directed catheter, such as a balloon wedge catheter, can be used to cross the tricuspid valve and subsequently a soft-tipped wire to cross the pulmonary valve prior to positioning the balloon angioplasty catheter. Whilst this may be difficult or time consuming in very small patients, the risk of not doing so could result in the catheter and or wire passing through the chordae of the tricuspid valve. This in turn may result in damage to these structures when the balloon catheter is advanced or retrieved through the right ventricle.

#### 14 **What are the indications for pulmonary artery angioplasty and stent placement?**

- Abnormalities of the pulmonary arteries are involved in a wide variety of congenital heart defects. In the clinical setting, stenotic or hypoplastic arteries may lead to a pressure burden on the right ventricle.
- Balloon angioplasty alone is indicated for both severe main pulmonary artery and severe branch pulmonary artery stenosis, particularly in very small patients or in those with pulmonary arteries with very complicated anatomy in whom primary stent implantation is not a viable option.
- Significant stenosis is obvious when there is a:
  - a) measurable gradient of 20-30mmHg across the stenotic area;
  - b) elevation of the right ventricular or proximal main pulmonary artery pressure > two thirds of systemic pressure, secondary to more distal obstruction;
  - c) relative flow discrepancy between the two lungs of 35%/65% or worse.
- In low pulmonary flow situations, such as with Glenn shunts and a Fontan circulation, the gradient in the pulmonary bed is an unreliable determinant of the degree of stenosis.
- A similar situation presents when there is decompression run-off to a compliant contralateral artery. In this context, the pressure gradient alone is not a good indicator of severity.
- Pulmonary artery stents are indicated in main or branch pulmonary artery stenosis that is not expected to have, or has not had, an

adequate or persistent response to pulmonary artery balloon dilation (Figure 12).

**<sup>222</sup> Figure 12. Lateral projection angiogram demonstrating: A) stenosis of the left pulmonary artery (LPA)(arrow); and B) improvement of the LPA diameter (arrow) following treatment with balloon angioplasty and stent placement.**

- It is ideal that the stents placed into the central branch pulmonary arteries have adult-size potential. The use of smaller stents are recognised as a palliative procedure and a commitment for surgical removal or potential of enlargement at a future date.
- The risks of pulmonary angioplasty and stent placement include vessel perforation, arrhythmia during manipulation of the catheters and wires, and bleeding.
- The risks of the stents specifically include misplacement, embolisation and jailing of the adjacent branch vessels. Embolisation to the ventricle may require an emergent surgical approach for removal of the stent.
- Placement of a pulmonary artery stent can represent a significant burden to subsequent surgical interventions, which can be indicated by in-stent stenosis, or other surgical indications, such as pulmonary valve interventions.
- Stents placed beyond the bifurcation can produce complex branches stenosis, including lobar bifurcations requiring extensive reconstructions. The use of pulmonary artery branch stenting should

be discussed at a multidisciplinary team meeting, with both interventional cardiology and surgical teams present.

#### 15 **What are the indications for pulmonary vein angioplasty or stent placement?**

- Pulmonary vein stenosis can present as:
  - a) an isolated congenital lesion or in association with other cardiac defects;
  - b) an acquired lesion after corrective surgery for anomalous pulmonary venous connections;
  - c) a complication of extreme prematurity;
  - d) a complication of pulmonary vein isolation ablation in adult patients with atrial fibrillation.
- Comparison data of balloon angioplasty versus stent dilation suggest that stents achieve better results and have longer patency rates. Final stent diameter is an important factor, with a greater end diameter being associated with a better outcome.
- Paediatric pulmonary vein ballooning and stenting yields generally poorer results in the mid to long term, as compared to vein interventions in adults following ablation. Pulmonary vein interventions in children with congenital, progressively obstructing disease are rarely curative, with or without the addition of surgical interventions.
- Pulmonary artery wedge angiograms with follow through to the levophase are useful in this diagnosis, if transseptal access to the pulmonary veins is not available.
- The angioplasty technique requires appropriate balloon diameter selection. More recently, cutting and drug-eluting balloons have been used.
- Stent implantation can be considered if there is elastic recoil of the lesion or if vessel dissection is noted. A variety of stents are available but the goal is to place a stent which may be subsequently dilated (Figure 13).
- Complications are similar to angioplasty and stenting of other vascular structures and include vessel dissection, stent malposition or embolisation.
- Pulmonary haemorrhage after intense intervention on the pulmonary veins is not uncommon. Blood is cross-matched and available, and very frequently patients are monitored in a critical care area after intervention.

#### 16 **What are the indications for ductus arteriosus stent placement?**

- Stenting of the ductus arteriosus has been used to establish a reliable source of pulmonary blood flow for the palliation of:
  - a) cyanotic heart disease, notably patients with severe tetralogy of Fallot and all forms of pulmonary atresia, as an alternative to aortopulmonary surgical shunts;
  - b) neonates with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), as part of the hybrid procedure, in an alternative to the Norwood procedure;
  - c) neonates with non-HLHS lesions, where a single-stage repair may be contraindicated.
- Current literature suggests that ductus stenting is most favourable in neonates with a morphologically straight ductus (no more than one to two bends), requiring a reliable palliation for months.
- In full-term neonates, a stent diameter of 3.5-4mm generally provides adequate palliation of pulmonary blood flow without leading to excessive pulmonary blood flow. In patients weighing less than 3kg, a diameter of 3mm may be adequate.
- Complications of the procedure include those associated with cardiac catheterisation in neonates, particularly femoral vessel injury or occlusion.

- In patients with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow, there is a risk of requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or bypass in cases of injury to the duct during manipulation or unexpected spasm compromising adequate pulmonary blood flow.
- Stent malposition or embolisation can occur, requiring surgical intervention.
- Hybrid procedures required in HLHS and non-HLHS patients involve surgical placement of bilateral branch pulmonary artery bands and stent delivery through a median sternotomy, normally performed without cardiopulmonary bypass.

#### 17 **What are the general principles of patent ductus arteriosus closure?**

- The indications for PDA occlusion vary depending on the physiological context at the time of presentation.
- In small and premature neonates (<2.4kg) with a low PVR and persistent left-to-right shunt, duct closure is performed to control pulmonary overcirculation, as well as prevention of endarteritis. Such procedures are challenging but more favourable now, due to the development of occlusion devices with a better profile for these specific ducts.
- In infants with a large PDA and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, a full haemodynamic study to assess vascular reactivity to pulmonary vasodilator therapy prior to intervention is required. If reactive, closure may be indicated.
- In older patients who have developed Eisenmenger syndrome and have a persistent right-to-left shunt, occlusion is contraindicated.
- The PDA can be occluded with different devices, including:
  - a) coils which are usually used to close a small PDA (<2mm). The Flipper® Cook coil is the most frequently used controlleddelivery coil and ranges from 3mm diameter by three loops to 8mm diameter by five loops. The Nit-Occlud® coil facilitates closure of somewhat larger ducts and also has a controlled release;
  - b) devices (Figure 14) which include:
    - i) Amplatzer™ Duct Occluder;
    - ii) Amplatzer™ Duct Occluder II;
    - iii) Amplatzer™ Vascular Plug II;
    - iv) MVP™ microvascular plug (Medtronic).

- The device is selected based on the morphology (Figure 15) and minimum diameter of the duct. See below for different types of PDA morphology.
- Serious complications of PDA occlusion are rare and include inadvertent device embolisation into the pulmonary and systemic circulation. Obstruction to aortic or pulmonary flow is a risk particularly in small infants. Haemolysis secondary to residual shunt is more commonly seen following coil occlusion.

#### 18 **What are the current recommendations for atrial septostomy/stenting in congenital heart disease?**

- Balloon atrial septostomy is the longest established interventional cardiac catheterisation procedure, first performed by Rashkind and Miller in 1966 on a neonate with transposition of the great vessels and severe desaturation.
- Whenever possible, septostomy is performed at the bedside using echocardiographic guidance, to minimise exposure to radiation.
- Access is usually obtained from the femoral or umbilical vein. A balloon is passed across the interatrial septum (the patent foramen ovale if present), inflated and quickly pulled back in order to tear the fossa ovalis membrane.

- In cases of a muscular septum and restrictive muscular communication, a stent may be placed, under fluoroscopy guidance.
- Indications for atrial septostomy include:
  - a) transposition of the great arteries with a restrictive or intact atrial communication, requiring enhanced atrial mixing;
  - b) restriction to an obligatory left-to-right atrial shunt, such as in mitral atresia and hypoplastic left heart syndrome, requiring unrestrictive left-to-right shunting;
  - c) pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum, tricuspid atresia or total anomalous pulmonary venous return, requiring unrestrictive right-to-left shunting;
  - d) left atrial hypertension on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support requiring decompression.

#### 19 **What are the principles of transcatheter closure of <sup>a</sup> secundum atrial septal defect?**

- Indications for transcatheter device closure of a secundum ASD include:
  - a) right heart volume overload;
  - b) sequelae of paradoxical emboli, such as stroke or recurrent transient ischaemic attacks;
  - c) symptomatic transient right-to-left shunting causing cyanosis, where a communication to maintain adequate cardiac output is not required (platypnoea-orthodeoxia).
- Contraindications for transcatheter device closure of a secundum ASD include:
  - a) advanced pulmonary vascular disease;
  - b) restrictive left heart physiology, usually in elderly patients with impaired left ventricular function.
- Echocardiography plays an important role in the guidance of these procedures and assessment of the result. Either intracardiac or transoesophageal echocardiography can be used.
- The process of transcatheter device closure of the ASD includes:
  - a) adequate sizing of the defect using a compliant balloon that is placed through the defect and inflated until flow across the ASD stops, based on echocardiographic imaging;
  - b) measuring the waist of the balloon by echocardiography and/or fluoroscopy;

- c) selecting the ASD device based on this measurement.
- The currently available devices include:
  - a) self-centring devices:
    - i) Abbott Amplatzer™ Septal Occluder (Figure 16A and B);
    - ii) Occlutech Figulla Flex II ® ASD device;
    - iii) CeraFlex™ ASD Occluder;
    - iv) Cardia Ultrasept™ atrial septal defect closure device;
    - v) GORE® CARDIOFORM ASD Occluder;
  - b) non-self-centring devices:
    - i) GORE® Septal Occluder (Figure 16C and D);
    - ii) Occlutech, Cera and Abbott (Amplatzer™) produce a variant of their self-centring devices.

In the United States, currently only the Abbott Amplatzer™ Septal Occluder and the GORE® Septal Occluder are approved for secundum ASD closure.

#### 20 **What are the indications for Fontan fenestration closure?**

- The strategy of creating a right-to-left shunt decompression valve in the Fontan circuit during all Fontan completion procedures is favoured in some centres, as it allows the venous pressures to be reduced and it can help to prevent hepatic ischaemia by pressure overload, leading to portal hypertension, cirrhosis and protein-losing enteropathy.
- In patients with borderline physiology or anatomy, such as diminished ventricular function, pulmonary artery lesions, elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, the presence of a fenestration is deemed necessary by most.
- The beneficial effects of a fenestration are, however, obtained at the expense of lower systemic oxygen saturations. Chronic desaturation can become a significant burden and lead to important complications.
- A thorough haemodynamic evaluation should be performed before attempting to close the fenestration in the catheterisation laboratory.

![](_page_25_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Figure 17. Angiographic images demonstrating: A) a patent Fontan fenestration with important shunt flow in the extracardiac conduit (arrow) and a narrow right pulmonary artery; and B) closure of the fenestration with an Amplatzer™ device (white arrow) and stent placement (red arrow) in the right pulmonary artery to allow better pulmonary run-off. The right atrial wall can also be seen (asterisks).**

- It is reasonable to consider transcatheter closure of a Fontan fenestration in patients with favourable haemodynamic status. These can be demonstrated with a temporary balloon occlusion of the fenestration, if the systemic oxygen saturation improves with only a modest rise in Fontan pressure or a fall in cardiac output <20%.
- Fenestrations may be closed using an ASD occluder (Figure 17), PFO occluder, VSD occluder, vascular plug or covered stent (Figure 18). The type of device chosen may be influenced by the type of Fontan operation, patient size, specifics of the anatomy and operator preference.

#### 21 **What are the principles of transcatheter closure of <sup>a</sup> ventricular septal defect?**

- Although ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the commonest congenital heart defect and accounts for 25% of all defects, it is one of the rarer interventions in most countries.
- Interventional closure has been performed as an alternative to surgery in selected native or residual perimembranous and muscular defects.
- Percutaneous VSD device closure is recommended in patients with a haemodynamically significant VSD, which is defined as having

- evidence of left-sided heart volume overload, heart failure or elevation of right-sided heart pressures secondary to left-to-right shunting. In some countries, small defects are closed for cultural and social reasons.
- For small infants who weigh <5kg or for patients with abnormal septal wall planes, percutaneous closure carries additional risk beyond the procedure and device-related adverse events.
- Other contraindications for transcatheter VSD closure include:
  - a) pulmonary vascular disease (>7 Wood Units m2);
  - b) sepsis;
  - c) contraindications for antiplatelet therapy;
  - d) defects associated with other cardiac lesions requiring surgery.
- The perimembranous septum is close to vital structures of the aortic valve, atrioventricular conduction tissue and the tricuspid valve. The vast majority of symptomatic infants have a VSD with dimensions that preclude safe interventional closure. Notwithstanding the general risks of catheter manipulation and device embolisation, both heart block and damage to the aortic and tricuspid valves remain serious complications.
- A number of devices (Figure 19) have been used for VSD closure, including:

![](_page_27_Picture_11.jpeg)

**Figure 19. Devices used for closure of a ventricular septal defect, including: A) Amplatzer™ Muscular VSD Occluder; B) Amplatzer™ Membranous VSD Occluder; and C) Amplatzer™ Duct Occluder II.** *Reproduced with permission from Abbott.*

a) Amplatzer™ Muscular VSD Occluder (Figure 20) — which is a self-expandable device made of nitinol wires, consisting of two flat discs having a diameter 8mm larger than a central connecting waist (7mm long). The diameter of the waist determines the size of the device. The device needs a delivery sheath ranging from 6 to 9Fr in size;

Ao = aorta; LV = left ventricle; IVS = interventricular septum.**

- b) Amplatzer™ Membranous VSD Occluder which consists of two discs of unequal size. The device is available in sizes from 4 to 18mm and requires delivery sheaths from 7 to 9Fr;
- c) Amplatzer™ Duct Occluder II.

#### 22 **What are the principles of hybrid closure of <sup>a</sup> ventricular septal defect?**

- The hybrid approach for VSD closure in children is a possible alternative to standard surgery, when CPB is contraindicated or its repair presents some specific challenges. It is used successfully in post-infarction communications in adults.
- Hybrid VSD closure is performed under general anaesthesia, via a median sternotomy.

• It can be performed in the catheterisation laboratory, hybrid laboratory or surgical theatre (Figure 21), although the latter makes the use of fluoroscopy more difficult. It is generally performed on a beating heart without the use of CPB.

![](_page_29_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Figure 21. Closure of a mid-septum muscular ventricular septal defect (VSD) using a hybrid approach: A) measurements of the VSD are obtained with transoesophageal or epicardial echocardiography to find an optimal puncture point on the right ventricular free wall; B) following a median sternotomy and securing of cannulation sites, a guidewire is passed through the right ventricular (RV) anterior wall and the target muscular VSD into the left ventricle (LV). A sheath is then inserted through the VSD into the LV cavity. An appropriate size-matched device is then chosen. Whilst on a beating heart, the left disc of the device is deployed in the LV cavity and pulled back to the septum. The right ventricular disc is deployed in the RV and opposed to the septum, closing the VSD; C) echocardiography is used to assess the ventricular septum for adequate positioning (red asterisk) and absence of any residual flow. IVS = interventricular septum; RA = right atrium; RV = right ventricle; PA = pulmonary artery; LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle.**

#### 23 **What are the principles of percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement?**

- It is reasonable to consider percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement in a patient with severe pulmonary regurgitation or stenosis provided the patient meets the anatomical criteria for the available percutaneous pulmonary valves, which include:
  - a) pulmonary insufficiency >25% and one of the following cardiac magnetic resonance imaging quantitative criteria:
    - i) RV end-diastolic volume indexed (RVEDVi) >150mL/m2;
    - ii) RV end-systolic volume indexed (RVESVi) >80mL/m2;
    - iii) RV ejection fraction <47%;
    - iv) LV ejection fraction <55%;
  - b) haemodynamically significant abnormalities, defined as RVOT obstruction with RV systolic pressure ≥70% of systemic pressure, and at least moderate tricuspid regurgitation;
  - c) symptoms and signs of heart failure, including exercise intolerance (defined as exercise testing with ≤70% predicted peak V̇O2 for age and sex, not explained by chronotropic incompetence) or syncope attributable to arrhythmia;
  - d) QRS duration >160ms on electrocardiogram.
- Ideally, patients should have a previously implanted conduit ranging between 16 and 29mm, or an RVOT or pulmonary artery with similar diameters.
- Transcatheter valves are also indicated for valve-in-valve placement, for example, in patients with prior surgical biological or transcatheter pulmonary valve placement.
- Prior to pulmonary valve replacement, it is important to assess and treat where necessary any associated anomalies, such as pulmonary artery stenosis, bifurcation stenosis and residual intracardiac defects.
- Pre-procedural cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or CT angiography are useful to define anatomy.
- Coronary compression by the implanted valve is a risk, which increases with prior coronary interventions, such as patients who have undergone an arterial switch or Ross procedure. For this, a coronary challenge of angiographic assessment of coronary artery anatomy with simultaneous balloon dilation of the estimated landing zone of the pulmonary valve can be performed.

#### 24 **Which pulmonary valves are available for transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement?**

• Edwards SAPIEN XT™ Transcatheter Heart Valve (THV) — which consists of a balloon-expandable, radiopaque, cobalt-chromium frame, a tri-leaflet bovine pericardial tissue valve and polyethylene terephthalate

- (PET) fabric skirt. The available sizes range between 23mm and 29mm, requiring a 16-20Fr hydrophilic sheath for insertion.
- Edwards SAPIEN™ valves which are available in multiple generations with the newest available being the SAPIEN 3™ (Figure 22A) and SAPIEN Ultra™ (Figures 22B and C). The SAPIEN 3™ is made with a radiopaque, cobalt-chromium frame, tri-leaflet bovine pericardial tissue valve, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fabric skirt. It has a lower profile than the SAPIEN XT version and only requires a maximum sheath size of 16Fr for the 29mm valve.
- Edwards Alterra Adaptive Prestent™ (Figure 22D) which is a selfexpanding stent that allows percutaneous valve replacement in the native right ventricular outflow. The Alterra Adaptive Prestent™ is designed to reduce the diameter of large irregular RVOTs and provide a circular, semi-rigid landing zone to place a SAPIEN 3™ THV.

• Medtronic Melody™ Transcather Pulmonary Valve (Figure 23) which is made of a bovine jugular vein (BJV) valve sutured within a platinum iridium frame. There are three available sizes (18mm, 20mm and 22mm) and the delivery system constitutes a 22Fr sheath.

#### 25 **What are the indications for intervention on coarctation of the aorta?**

- Whilst angioplasty alone does have a place in the management, modern practice has evolved to a predominantly primary stent angioplasty strategy in patients weighing more than 20kg.
- The recommendations for transcatheter balloon angioplasty include:
  - a) recoarctation when associated with a transcatheter systolic gradient of >20mmHg or in the presence of significant collateral vessels and suitable angiographic anatomy, irrespective of patient age;
  - b) patients with a univentricular heart or significant ventricular dysfunction may not exhibit high gradients but are candidates for intervention.
- It is reasonable to consider balloon angioplasty of native coarctation (Figure 24) as a palliative measure to stabilise a patient irrespective of age when extenuating circumstances are present, such as

![](_page_33_Picture_2.jpeg)

**238 Figure 24. Lateral view angiographic images demonstrating: A) a tight and discrete hour-glass coarctation (arrows); and B) improvement (red arrows) following balloon angioplasty.**

severely depressed ventricular function, severe mitral regurgitation, low cardiac output, end-organ dysfunction (such as renal failure), or systemic disease affected by the cardiac condition.

- The recurrence rate is higher for younger patients (<6 months of age), and there is a small but important incidence of aneurysm formation after balloon dilation of native coarctation at any age.
- The recommendations for transcatheter stent placement (Figure 25) in native coarctation or recoarctation include:
  - a) recurrent coarctation in patients who are of sufficient size for safe stent placement, in whom the stent can be expanded to an adult size, and who have a transcatheter systolic coarctation gradient >20mmHg.
- Where possible, a stent that can be expanded to an adult size should be used. Current limiting factors are the size of the sheath required to deliver such a stent.
- The availability of surgical expertise and stent technology should dictate local institutional practice.
- Balloon and/or stent angioplasty of coarctation carries a serious risk of vessel disruption and bleeding. Covered stent technology offers some protection from this complication and many operators use the

**239 Figure 25. Lateral view angiographic images demonstrating: A) a tight hourglass coarctation with mild pre-stenosis dilatation; and B) improvement following balloon angioplasty and stent insertion (asterisk).**

covered CP Stent™ (Figure 26) by choice, accepting that the sheaths required to deliver such stents may limit their use to teenage and adult patients.

**Figure 26. Covered CP Stent™ used for coarctation of the aorta.**

• If transverse arch hypoplasia accompanies discrete coarctation, it may also be tackled using stent angioplasty with the recognised problems of crossing the major head and neck vessels. In such circumstances, open cell design stents are ideally suited.
