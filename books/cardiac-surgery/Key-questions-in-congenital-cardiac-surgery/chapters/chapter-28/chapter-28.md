### Left ventricular outflow tract lesions

**David R. Anderson**

#### 1 **What is the left ventricular outflow tract?**

- The left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) represents the passage from the left ventricular (LV) cavity to the ascending aorta. It is typically considered to have three components, including:
  - a) subaortic component which is formed by the combination of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve, the membranous septum and the muscular septum to which the aorta is attached (Figure 1);

- b) aortic valve which is formed of three cusps or leaflets suspended from the wall of the aorta in a semilunar fashion. The cusps extend down and on to the muscle of the ventricular septum thereby creating three sinuses, two of which give rise to the coronary arteries. The sinuses and corresponding leaflets are named from their coronary arteries, right and left, while the third is known as the non-coronary sinus. The sinuses bulge slightly outwards from the aorta creating the flow vortices that are important in aortic valve closure and coronary perfusion, a feature recognised by Leonardo Da Vinci in the 15th century. The complete structure is called the 'aortic root'; c) supravalvular component — which commences at the sinotubular
- 2 **What is the aortic annulus?**
- Although there is no actual anatomic structure that can be classed as an 'annulus', it corresponds to the lowest points of attachment of the aortic valve leaflets, which are in the shape of a three-pointed crown (Figure 2). An alternative name is 'virtual basal ring'.

junction and extends into the proximal ascending aorta.

**Figure 2. Aortic root complex that extends from the 'annulus' (green) corresponding to the lowest point of attachment of the aortic leaflets (red) to the sinotubular junction (blue). The outline of the leaflet attachment to the aortic wall (red) conforms to a three-pointed crown.** *Reproduced with permission from Professor Robert H. Anderson, Biosciences Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.*

• The meeting point of the leaflets is known as the commissure, with tissue beneath known as the subcommissural area (Figure 3).

- The subcommissural areas will be partly aortic wall and more inferiorly:
  - a) muscular septum (beneath the left/right commissure);
  - b) membranous septum (beneath the right/non-coronary commissure);
  - c) anterior mitral valve leaflet (beneath the left/non-coronary commissure).

#### 3 **What is the sinotubular junction?**

- The sinotubular junction (STJ) represents the point where the tips of the commissures meet the ascending aorta.
- The diameter of the aorta at the level of the sinotubular junction is normally less than that at the mid-sinus level.

• The whole complex of the aortic valve, sinuses of Valsalva and coronary ostia represents the aortic root (Figure 4).

#### 4 **Describe the embryological development of the aortic valve**

- The semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonary) begin to form in the 4th week of gestation.
- Neural crest cells migrate into the primitive arterial trunk forming endocardial cushions from which the aortic and pulmonary valves differentiate, as the primitive trunk undergoes its spiral separation into the aorta and pulmonary arteries.

#### 5 **What are the lesions involving the left ventricular outflow tract?**

- Lesions may occur in all three components in isolation or in combination:
  - a) intraventricular tract (subvalvular);
  - b) aortic valve complex (valvular);
  - c) aortic root and aorta to the isthmus region (supravalvular).
- In each of these sectors, specific lesions may occur resulting in stenosis, regurgitation, dilatation or a combination (Figure 5).

**Figure 5. Distribution of lesions in the left ventricular outflow tract by sector involved. HOCM = hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy; AVSD = atrioventricular septal defect; TAV = tricuspid aortic valve; BAV = bicuspid aortic valve; UAV = unicuspid aortic valve; LV = left ventricle; VSD = ventricular septal defect; ED = Ehlers-Danlos; CoA = coarctation of the aorta; HLHS = hypoplastic left heart syndrome.**

#### 6 **What are the causes of subaortic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction?**

- Subaortic lesions (Figure 6) consist of an obstruction proximal to the aortic valve within the left ventricle, including:
  - a) intraventricular obstruction:
    - i) hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM);
    - ii) accessory mitral valve tissue, such as accessory chordae or fibrous nodules/cysts;
    - iii) systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM);
  - b) subvalvular stenosis:
    - i) discrete membrane or ring (Figure 7);
    - ii) posterior deviation of the outlet portion of the interventricular septum (IVS) in the setting of a perimembranous or subaortic ventricular septal defect;
    - iii) LVOT shape (atrioventricular septal defect).
- In some cases, the obstruction is 'tunnel'-like and involves the whole of the outflow tract.

• The so-called discrete 'subaortic membrane' is never present at birth but develops later. It forms as a ring of fibrous tissue attached circumferentially to the interventricular septum, anterior mitral valve leaflet and the fibrous trigones, approximately 3-5mm below the aortic valve.

#### 7 **What are the causes of aortic valvular left ventricular tract obstruction?**

- Aortic valvular lesions (congenital aortic stenosis) are the most common form of LVOTO and represent obstruction at the level of the aortic valve, with varying morphology and severity.
- Stenosis can result from:
  - a) reduced size of an otherwise normally structured valve;
  - b) reduction of the orifice area due to leaflet fusion or thickening;
  - c) a combination of both.
- There may be fusion of one, two or all three commissures, resulting in a bicuspid (BAV), unicuspid (UAV) or 'windsock' aortic valve (Table 1).

- BAV is by far the most common anomaly. It presents with high variability and may function normally for several decades.
- In other more severe cases, there is fusion of all three commissures resulting in a unicuspid aortic valve (UAV), which creates a 'windsock orifice' or 'keyhole opening'. This is usually found between the left and non-coronary leaflets.
- The valve leaflets are often thickened with myxomatous nodules adding to the obstructive effect.
- At its extreme, the valve may be imperforate, representing aortic atresia.
- A quadricuspid aortic valve is extremely rare and usually only found in the context of truncus arteriosus, where it is typically regurgitant but may also be stenotic.

#### 8 What are the causes of congenital aortic regurgitation?

- Isolated congenital aortic regurgitation is rare.
- Regurgitation can develop in the context of BAV due to leaflet stretch resulting in failure of coaptation often aggravated by dilatation of the sinuses and sinotubular junction.

- Other causes of aortic regurgitation include:
  - a) connective tissue diseases (such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Turner syndrome) — where the regurgitation occurs in association with dilatation of the aortic root;
  - b) infective endocarditis;
  - c) aortoventricular tunnel where one of the leaflets is not attached to the ventriculo-arterial junction, thus creating a gap at the level of the anatomical annulus that extends as a tunnel into the LV;
  - d) complication of surgery or balloon dilatation for stenosis.

### 9 **What are the causes of supravalvular aortic stenosis?**

- Supravalvular aortic stenosis is rarely evident at birth but may appear in early childhood. It is often associated with a gene defect as part of Williams syndrome and commonly affects the pulmonary arteries as well (Figure 8).
- The narrowing is at and just above the sinotubular junction. It may be a diaphragm-like structure or can be more diffuse extending along the ascending aorta and round the arch as far as the isthmus (Figure 9).
- Viewed externally, the aorta can be seen to have a waist at the sinotubular junction which may appear not too severe.
- The degree of obstruction, however, is increased by a ridge of thickened media projecting into the lumen adjacent to the 'waist'.
- Additionally, the media is often thickened throughout the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and its branches, creating a diffuse type of obstruction affecting the whole ascending aorta, arch and occasionally the proximal arch vessels.
- Supravalvular aortic stenosis can be complicated by the presence of coronary ostial stenosis, secondary to concentric obstruction, kinking of the proximal left main coronary artery, or a membrane extending from the diaphragm-like aortic obstruction into the sinuses (Figure 10).

#### 10 **Which other congenital abnormalities result in or are associated with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction?**

- Lesions of the LVOT, especially obstruction, have multiple associations. When this occurs, it is referred to as complex LVOTO or complex aortic stenosis.
- A subaortic membrane may develop after successful repair of coarctation or aortic arch interruption with or without surgical VSD closure.
- Following repair of an atrioventricular septal defect, a ring or fibrous patch may develop in the LVOT, in addition to the obstructive effect of any secondary chordae from the superior bridging leaflet.
- Bicuspid aortic valve occurs in at least 10% of patients with coarctation of the aorta. Both lesions are strongly associated with Turner syndrome.
- Mitral valve abnormalities, such as an inflow ridge (supravalvular mitral membrane) or a single papillary muscle (parachute mitral) may be associated with LVOTO. The combination of mitral valve abnormalities, LVOTO and aortic arch abnormalities is known as Shone complex or syndrome (Figure 11).

![](_page_11_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 11. Computed tomography images in a patient with Shone complex, characterised by: A) a small left ventricular cavity (red asterisk), prominent interventricular septum protruding into the left ventricular outflow tract and small aortic annulus; B) coarctation of the aorta (white asterisk); and C) aortic valve stenosis (red arrow).**

- In association with aortic valve stenosis and LVOTO, the left ventricular cavity may be undersized and/or the endocardium replaced with fibrous tissue (endocardial fibroelastosis [EFE]).
- At its extreme, the combination of defects may mean that the left side of the heart is incapable of supporting the systemic circulation (hypoplastic left heart syndrome, [HLHS]).

#### 11 **What is the aetiology of left ventricular outflow tract lesions?**

- Lesions of the LVOT represent a wide spectrum of conditions and it is therefore difficult to group them all into one aetiological mechanism.
- In most cases, the exact cause is not known, and no single common causative factor has been identified.
- One theory suggests that abnormal blood flows within the embryonic heart may inhibit development, while genetic causes have also been put forward.
- It is known that aortic stenosis seen in a foetus at weeks' gestation with an adequate left ventricle may progress to aortic atresia with a small left ventricle and HLHS by term perhaps supporting the flow theory.
- HLHS is one of the most common cardiac defects and occurs once in approximately 3500 births.
- BAV is much more common affecting 1-2% of the population.

- Both defects have a 2:1 male: female ratio.
- Apart from Williams syndrome, there are no frequent genetic associations with recognised loci.

#### 12 **What is the pathophysiology of left ventricular outflow tract lesions?**

- Whereas obstructive lesions can be haemodynamically significant as early as the initial phases of gestation and be obviously symptomatic at birth, aortic insufficiency is almost never significant in the early years of life.
- Before birth, oxygenated blood returning from the placenta mostly passes through the patent foramen ovale into the left side of the heart to be circulated by the LV through the aortic valve (Figure 12).

![](_page_12_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Figure 12. Normal foetal circulation with bypass of the pulmonary circulation via the foramen ovale.**

• Before birth, LVOTO regardless of severity has little impact, as the foetal systemic circulation is maintained from the right ventricle through the patent ductus arteriosus (Figure 13).

![](_page_13_Picture_3.jpeg)

**876 Figure 13. Foetal circulation in the presence of severe left ventricular tract obstruction, where the systemic circulation is maintained via the ductus arteriosus.**

#### 13 **What are the symptoms and signs of <sup>a</sup> patient with <sup>a</sup> left ventricular outflow tract lesion?**

- After birth on closure of the ductus arteriosus, the left ventricle must maintain the systemic circulation.
- Severe LVOTO may result in a low cardiac output state with acidosis, rising lactate and diminishing urine output leading to death.
- If the ductus arteriosus stays open, systemic flow is maintained but as the pulmonary resistance falls, blood flow to the lungs will increase placing a high output demand on the right ventricle, eventually leading to cardiac failure.
- Moderate severity LVOTO may present as poor feeding, sweating on feeds and failure to thrive. On examination, the signs include tachycardia, tachypnoea, and a dynamic cardiac impulse. An enlarged liver with subcostal recession and grunting respirations may also be observed, as well as cool pallid skin with mottling, diminished femoral pulses and a systolic murmur.
- Less severe LVOTO may be asymptomatic and the condition only detected because of a systolic murmur on routine clinical examination.

• Aortic regurgitation may be asymptomatic initially unless the valve suddenly develops severe leakage. Otherwise, symptoms and signs are like those recognised in acquired aortic regurgitation. These include dyspnoea, orthopnoea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. In patients with more severe regurgitation, especially if sudden onset, they may present with tachycardia, fatigue and chest pain. On examination, a wide pulse pressure can be seen, especially when insufficiency is severe. Other typical signs include a diastolic murmur and hyper-pulsatile peripheral arteries (which are especially prominent in infants and teenagers). In some cases, pulsation of the carotid arteries, abdominal wall or femoral fossa can be seen.

#### 14 **What is the natural history of severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and hypoplastic left heart syndrome?**

- Neonates with critical aortic stenosis, HLHS and a restrictive interatrial communication may not survive beyond the first few hours of life without treatment.
- In severe aortic stenosis and HLHS, neonatal death is common due to poor systemic perfusion, marked failure to thrive and pulmonary congestion even when the ductus arteriosus remains patent. There is a high risk of death throughout the first year of life.
- Survivors will develop pulmonary vascular disease due to the persistent high pulmonary artery pressure.
- For patients with less severe forms, they may not develop symptoms until well into adult life, as a mildly stenotic valve at birth or bicuspid aortic valve tends to become more stenotic with time.
- Left ventricular hypertrophy develops which is associated with an increasing risk of potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias.
- Later symptoms include increasing dyspnoea on exercise, fatigue and occasionally chest discomfort (angina pectoris) on exercise.
- Syncope on exercise or at rest is a late and dangerous symptom, associated with increased mortality.

#### 15 **What are the ECG features of aortic stenosis (Figure 14)?**

- Left ventricular hypertrophy is the dominant feature.
- In adults with late developing aortic stenosis, there may be a left ventricular strain pattern.
- In some patients, there is evidence of ventricular instability with frequent multifocal ectopics.

#### 16 **What are the echocardiographic features of aortic stenosis?**

- Echocardiography is the mainstay of diagnosis and severity assessment, with other modalities rarely needed, except in adults (Figures 15-21).
- M-mode (Figure 19), 2D and 3D are now an integral part of the diagnosis, assessment, and pre-operative work-up of LVOT lesions, including those of the ascending aorta and arch in children.
- Doppler interrogation with pulsed and continuous wave, colour flow and tissue Doppler imaging are essential to demonstrate the functional effects of stenosis and regurgitation (Figures and 21).
- The standard use of echocardiography in assessing the LV outflow tract should include the following elements (Figures 15-18):
  - a) sequential segmental analysis, to assess general cardiac anatomy;
  - b) level of obstruction subvalvular, valvular, supravalvular or a combination;

  - i) modes of subvalvular obstruction;
  - ii) anatomy of the aortic valve, number of leaflets, thickness, and mobility;
  - iii) presence or absence of lesions, nodules or vegetations;
- d) severity of obstruction using pulsed wave, continuous wave, and colour flow Doppler;
- e) nature and degree of aortic valve regurgitation;

  - ii) degree of hypertrophy (wall thickness);
  - iii) presence or absence of endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE).

#### 17 **What are the chest radiological features of left ventricular outflow tract lesions?**

- In many cases, the chest radiograph may be relatively unremarkable and provide little information.
- In the presence of severe cardiac failure, especially with aortic regurgitation, the cardiac silhouette may be enlarged. Although severe aortic regurgitation with radiological cardiac enlargement is rare in neonates and infants, it may be seen in children and commonly in adults. In such cases, the lung fields are often plethoric.

#### 18 **What are the magnetic resonance imaging features of left ventricular outflow tract lesions?**

- Cardiac MRI is very useful to demonstrate the:
  - a) sequential segmental analysis to assess general cardiac anatomy;
  - b) level of obstruction (Figure 22) subvalvular, valvular, supravalvular or a combination;
  - c) mechanism of obstruction:
    - i) modes of subvalvular obstruction (Figure 23);
    - ii) anatomy of the aortic valve, number of leaflets, thickness, and mobility (Figure 24);
    - iii) presence or absence of root lesions or nodules;

- e) nature of aortic regurgitation and regurgitant fraction:
  - i) associated anomalies such as aortic coarctation, hypoplasia of the ascending aorta and aortic arch, and anomalies of the coronary arteries;
  - ii) pathology of the aortic root, including accurate sizing and follow-up for dilatation;
- f) assessment of the left ventricle:
  - i) end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions;
  - ii) degree of hypertrophy;
  - iii) function;
  - iv) presence or absence of endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE).

#### 19 **What are the computed tomography scan features of left ventricular outflow tract lesions?**

- Cardiac CT may obtain similar information and is superior to MRI in infants with tachycardia.
- Cardiac CT with fast acquisition enables 3D reconstruction of both extracardiac and intracardiac structures (Figure 25).
- It is useful for the identification of:
  - a) level of obstruction subvalvular, valvular, supravalvular or a combination;
  - b) mechanism of obstruction:
    - i) modes of subvalvular obstruction;
    - ii) presence or absence of root dilatation;
  - c) associated anomalies such as aortic coarctation, hypoplasia of the ascending aorta and aortic arch;
  - d) anomalies, course, and position of the coronary arteries;
  - e) pathology of the aortic root, including accurate sizing and serial follow-up measurement for dilatation.

#### 20 **What are the cardiac catheterisation features of left ventricular outflow tract lesions?**

- Historically, cardiac catheterisation was used to assess LVOTO pressure gradients and quantify ventricular systolic function.
- In contemporary practice, cardiac catheterisation is rarely used in babies and children for diagnostic purposes but may be used in older children or adults to complement CT information about coronary anatomy, especially in cases of Williams syndrome (Figure 26).

![](_page_24_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Figure 26. Cardiac catheterisation in a patient with Williams syndrome demonstrating: A) supravalvular stenosis; and B) stenosis of the coronary ostia.**

- Cardiac catheterisation is often used in neonates, infants, and children for primary balloon valvuloplasty of critical and severe AS (Figure 27).
- In adults, cardiac catheterisation is mainly used to assess coronary arteries in association with primary and postoperative lesions of the aortic root.

#### 21 **What are the indications for intervention on lesions below the aortic valve?**

- Indications and timing for intervention vary depending on whether the LVOT obstruction is isolated or associated with other lesions.
- In cases of isolated obstruction, treatment is indicated if there are symptoms, or a peak-to-peak gradient >50mmHg on echocardiography or signs of left ventricular hypertrophy.
- Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) may help provide objective evidence of functional limitation or deterioration when symptoms are vague or not admitted by the patient.
- In cases where the obstruction is associated with a VSD, as in posterior malalignment of the interventricular outlet septum, intervention may be indicated by the criteria pertaining to VSD closure. The outlet obstruction can increase left-to-right shunting through the VSD, lowering the threshold for surgical closure.
- LVOT obstruction associated with an atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) normally improves or disappears when the AVSD is addressed, and rarely requires surgery in the neonatal period.

#### 22 **What are the indications for intervention for aortic stenosis?**

- Treatment decisions depend on the presence of symptoms and severity of obstruction.
- Considerations on long-term prognosis influence the timing of intervention.
- In general, intervention is indicated for patients with symptoms associated with aortic stenosis (peak gradient >50mmHg, Doppler velocity >3.5m/sec). There are no standardised values of indexed valve orifice areas for children, to define the severity of aortic stenosis and guide intervention timing.
- In the adult congenital population with aortic valve stenosis, the indications follow the general indications for acquired aortic stenosis.
- In neonates, a gradient >30mmHg will likely result in poor systemic perfusion unless the ductus arteriosus is maintained open. Once the ductus closes, the LV may not be able to maintain the circulation leading to low cardiac output and poor systemic perfusion. Raised LV end-diastolic pressure leads to raised pulmonary venous pressure and pulmonary congestion. Secondary pulmonary hypertension rapidly follows, and intervention is almost always indicated to prevent a fatal outcome.

#### 23 **What are the indications to intervene for aortic insufficiency in children and the adult congenital population?**

- Primary aortic insufficiency is rare in the neonatal population but not uncommon as a complication of surgical valvotomy or balloon valvuloplasty.
- Insufficiency not controlled medically with diuretics and ACE inhibitors is an indication for surgery. Left ventricular end-diastolic dimensions indexed to body surface area are used to assess response to therapy. A gradual increase over time is taken as an indication to plan intervention. In older patients, CPET may be useful.
- Where aortic insufficiency is associated with stenosis, the indications for treatment are those for the dominant component. Stenosis will appear worse in the context of significant regurgitation due to the larger stroke volume.
- Indications for intervention in the adult congenital population are the same as those for acquired disease.

#### 24 **What are the principles of treatment in neonates and infants with severe aortic stenosis?**

- Resuscitate, review, repair, recover, and rehabilitate are the principles of management.
- Postnatal collapse is first managed by a prostaglandin infusion to encourage reopening of the ductus arteriosus, often combined with inotropic support, mechanical ventilation, and renal support, if necessary (resuscitate).
- The initial objective is to correct any metabolic acidosis and to improve ventricular systolic function (review).
- Thereafter, therapeutic options include balloon dilatation of the aortic valve or surgical open aortic valvotomy (review).
- Although balloon aortic valvuloplasty is generally the favoured option, open valvotomy is preferred in some centres (repair).
- Balloon dilatation can produce significant aortic regurgitation if too large a balloon is selected (recover).
- Open surgery allows more precise relief of stenosis but requires sternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass (recover).
- Large meta-analyses have demonstrated that balloon valvuloplasty and surgical valvotomy carry comparable risks and produce comparable survival rates.
- Transcatheter interventions on the aortic valve in neonates tend to reduce the transvalvular gradient to a greater extent than open valvotomy. Open valvotomy, however, tends to produce lower rates of postoperative aortic regurgitation.
- Reintervention rates tend to be higher with balloon valvotomy, but this has not been widely demonstrated.
- All interventions are not definitive and future interventions are inevitable (rehabilitate and maintain under review).

#### 25 **What are the principles of treatment of aortic valve disease in children or adults with congenital heart disease (Table 2)?**

- Clinically significant aortic stenosis presenting late is normally the result of the progressive nature of aortic disease, as these patients will have had minor or moderate degrees of aortic valve disease at birth.
- Prostaglandin infusion is unlikely to reopen the ductus arteriosus beyond weeks old and therefore this is not a therapeutic option thereafter.
- The decision to treat is based on the severity of the stenosis (peak gradient of >50mmHg) or the presence of symptoms (if the gradient is <50mmHg). Echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy is also useful to influence the decision to treat.

• Balloon dilatation might be considered for stenosis if there is minimal calcification in the valve leaflets and no more than mild regurgitation.

- Open aortic valvotomy may otherwise be considered for stenosis, especially if this is a first intervention.
- If either method fails to adequately relieve the gradient, then valve repair or more likely replacement is indicated. Less than perfect results must often be accepted when replacement is not possible due to small size or other relative contraindications. It is imperative to try to avoid prosthetic replacement until a valve suitable for adult life can be implanted.
- Repair techniques include:
  - a) resuspension of prolapsing leaflets:
    - i) Trusler technique;
    - ii) leaflet central plication;
    - iii) free edge reinforcement;
  - b) leaflet reconstruction:
    - i) patch repair of a leaflet tear post-balloon valvuloplasty;
    - ii) patch leaflet augmentation to improve coaptation;
    - iii) patch repair of primary leaflet perforation;
  - c) bicuspidisation or tricuspidisation of BAV and UAV:
    - i) resection of the raphe and leaflet reconstruction in BAV;
    - ii) commissurotomy and reconstruction in UAV.
- Replacement options include:
  - a) autograft (Ross or Ross-Konno procedure);
  - b) heterografts:
    - i) homograft;
    - ii) bioprosthetic valve;
    - iii) mechanical valve.
- In the growing child, the Ross or Ross-Konno operation offers the option of an aortic valve which can grow and has no anticoagulation requirement. The disadvantage is that it exposes the patients to recurrent interventions for the right ventricular outflow tract, normally managed by implanting a homograft at the initial operation.
- A homograft or biological valve can be used in the aortic position, but they have no growth potential and limited durability in children. Moreover, the smallest tissue valve available is 19mm in diameter and in smaller children this requires the use of root-enlarging techniques, including a Nicks procedure, Konno procedure and modifications thereof.
- If none of these are possible, then replacement with a mechanical valve may be the only option but once again the smallest model is 16mm diameter.

• Management of anticoagulation in children is relatively more complex than in the adult population, not least because of the need for frequent blood sampling. Even in the presence of adequate anticoagulation levels, fibrous pannus can develop below the valve causing obstruction or interference with the leaflets.

#### 26 **What are the principles of treatment of lesions above the aortic valve?**

- In all cases, the principles of treatment aim to restore an unobstructed aortic root and ascending aorta. When present, coronary anomalies must be addressed.
- Anaesthesia for any procedure in the presence of supravalvular aortic stenosis carries significant risk because of restricted coronary filling in diastole and the possibility of proximal stenoses in the coronary arteries must always be considered.
- There are no percutaneous interventional options for these cases.
- Most techniques for aortic root augmentation in cases of supravalvular stenosis follow a similar surgical sequence.
- The aorta is transected or opened with an S-shaped incision, initially extending into the non-coronary sinus.
- Once open, the coronary ostia are inspected and any obstruction removed, followed by inspection of the aortic valve.
- If more than one sinus is to be enlarged, the coronary sinuses are incised lateral to the coronary ostium. The incisions are placed to the left of the right ostium and to the right of the left ostium. There may be very little space in the left sinus so enlargement may have to be confined to just two sinuses to avoid coronary damage. The noncoronary sinus is incised centrally.
- Any thickened media is shaved off, especially above the left coronary orifice.
- The incised sinuses are reconstructed with a patch, using Gore-Tex®, bovine pericardium, porcine pericardium or other heterologous materials.
- In the diffuse form, it may be necessary to augment the whole ascending aorta sometimes extending into the arch to avoid residual obstruction.
- Surgery having augmented the sinotubular junction, removing any extra tissue and membrane combined with patch enlargement of the sinuses, should normalise diastolic filling of the coronaries.
- Several surgical techniques are available using native and heterologous materials. The number of sinuses enlarged varies according to the technique: one sinus (McGoon's single patch

enlargement, Figure 28B); two sinuses (Doty's inverted V-shape, Figure 28C); or three sinuses, using heterologous material (Brom's procedure, Figure 29) or the native ascending aorta (Myers' modification).

**Figure 29.

A long elliptical patch is used to enlarge the non-coronary sinus and ascending aorta. LCA = left coronary artery; RCA = right coronary artery.**

#### 27 **What are the principles of treatment for very severe multi-level left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, including hypoplastic left heart syndrome?**

- LVOT obstruction of such complexity and severity as to equal HLHS is managed by single-ventricle palliation. The Norwood strategy, hybrid procedures and neonatal cardiac transplantation are the mainstay of active treatment.
- Comfort care with no active intervention remains a viable choice for some parents. Where the defect is picked up in foetal life, termination of the pregnancy may be an option depending on the law of individual countries.
- If the LV cavity is adequate and there is a mitral valve that is structurally and functionally normal, the initial objective should be to try to achieve a biventricular circulation.
- Tunnel-type LVOTO is very difficult to relieve by surgical resection alone as the aortic valve annulus is often equally small and cannot be enlarged without disruption of the aortic valve. Treatment therefore often requires resection of the tunnel obstruction and replacement of the aortic root with the pulmonary root (Ross-Konno procedure).

#### 28 **What are the principles of surgery for lesions of the left ventricular outflow tract?**

- To relieve the obstruction and achieve a long-lasting result with preservation of the native aortic valve.
- All surgery is via a median sternotomy, on cardiopulmonary bypass using a single right atrial cannula and arterial return to the aorta, with cardioplegic arrest of the heart.
- The left atrium may need venting to obtain a clear view or intermittent circulatory arrest can be used, especially in neonates.
- A hockey-stick incision into the non-coronary sinus or a transverse incision at the sinotubular junction may be used.
- If the patient is big enough, transoesophageal echo should be used to assess the result of surgery before chest closure.

#### 29 **What are the principles of surgery for subaortic lesions?**

- Nearly all subaortic lesions are treated working through the aortic valve. In some cases, as in repair of VSD or AVSD, the subaortic lesions can be accessed via the tricuspid valve or primum defect, respectively.
- Discrete subaortic membranes usually peel off the myocardium easily, using a combination of blunt and sharp dissection. The ridge

of tissue almost always extends on to the mitral and aortic valve leaflets, as well as the subcommissural triangles. This must be removed, to prevent future dysfunction of the aortic valve (Figure 30).

![](_page_33_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Figure 30. Transthoracic echocardiographic images demonstrating: A) a discrete subaortic membrane extending on to the mitral valve; B) complete resection of the membrane, resulting in significant augmentation of the left ventricular outflow tract diameter; and C) laminar flow on colour flow Doppler.**

- A myectomy of the LVOT may also be needed if there is significant left ventricular hypertrophy. When performing a myectomy, it is important to avoid damage to the bundle of His, which is located beneath the right and non-coronary commissures, so resection should be confined to the muscle that leads up to the commissure between the left and right cusps.
- Accessory mitral valve chords may also need to be removed, ensuring that mitral valve function is preserved. Often in patients with an atrioventricular septal defect, accessory chordae may be present from the superior bridging leaflet to the septum thereby obstructing the LVOT (Figure 31).

![](_page_34_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 31. Transoesophageal echocardiographic images of a patient with a long section of the left ventricular outflow tract obstructed by accessory mitral valve tissue fibrosis: A) before; and B) after resection.**

- Mitral valve cysts and accessory tissue tags are usually easy to remove with attention paid to avoid injury to the anterior leaflet.
- Endocardial fibroelastosis resection is sometimes indicated where LV filling is restricted. It is a concept under review and not always beneficial. EFE resection is usually via the mitral valve and retrograde through the LVOT if it is in association with aortic valve replacement. Usually, the resection needs to extend far down into the LVOT reaching the apex of the left ventricle in most cases. The indications for EFE resection have not yet been defined nor are benefits clearly evident.

#### 30 **What are principles of surgery for prosthetic aortic valve replacement?**

- Valve replacement in children and the adult congenital heart disease population follow the same principles.
- In the paediatric population, the surgeon should aim to implant as large a valve as possible to account for future growth as the prosthesis cannot grow. This is likely to require annular enlargement techniques, including the Nicks, Manougian, Konno (and their modifications) procedures.
- Special care is essential to ensure the coronary ostia are not interfered with by the prosthesis including the potential for kinking the proximal coronary arteries when annular enlargement is performed.
- When a large prosthesis is deployed with or without annular enlargement, there may be pressure on the bundle of His resulting in complete heart block.
- The choice of the implanted prosthesis should be based on patient and family preferences.

#### 31 **What are the principles of the Ross and Ross-Konno operations?**

- These procedures involve replacing the aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve, an autograft. This therefore enables future growth and avoids any need for anticoagulation. As the pulmonary valve can only be harvested as a valved conduit, both procedures are in fact an aortic root replacement.
- The Ross procedure and its modifications (Figure 32) may not be suitable in some cases of aortic root pathology, such as BAV-

![](_page_35_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Figure 32. The Ross-Konno operation: A) the aortic root, pulmonary infundibulum and both coronary ostia are harvested along the red dotted lines; B) once the pulmonary infundibulum has been harvested with a tongue of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) anterior wall (red circle) and the coronary proximal tract mobilised, an incision is made between the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) and the RVOT, across the aortopulmonary fold and the infundibular septum (red asterisk); C) the pulmonary autograft is then directly sutured on the ridge of muscle using the anterior right ventricular wall to enlarge the LVOT. Both coronary buttons are reimplanted. The aortic root is then completed; D) a right ventricle to pulmonary artery valved conduit (blue asterisks) is then used to reconstruct the RVOT continuity.**

associated aortopathy or other connective tissue diseases, such as Marfan syndrome. They are, however, suitable in cases of subvalvular and supravalvular congenital stenosis, associated with valvular disease as well as isolated valvular disease, especially stenosis.

- The operations are performed on cardiopulmonary bypass with cardioplegic arrest.
- During harvesting of the pulmonary autograft, particular attention is essential to avoid damage to the left main coronary artery and the first septal perforator of the left anterior descending artery.
- Several techniques are in use for the implant, including:
  - a) inclusion implant within a dilated aortic annulus;
  - b) free implant when the graft is sutured to the annulus itself.
- The Konno modification classically involves an incision into the ventricular septum between the LVOT and the RVOT which is then patched to enlarge the aortic annulus to accommodate the pulmonary valve implant. In practice, this is often not necessary as after removal of the aortic valve, a generous resection of the narrow LVOT tunnel can be performed, such that all obstruction is abolished. The pulmonary autograft can be harvested with a tongue of RVOT muscle from the free wall, which is then used to patch the incised ventricular septum as part of the implant into the aortic position.
- The excised pulmonary valve is usually replaced with heterologous valved conduits including:
  - a) homograft (most commonly);
  - b) bicuspidised homografts (in neonates and infants);
  - c) xenograft stentless bioprosthetic valves;
  - d) bovine jugular vein conduit;
  - e) stented valved conduits (in older patients).

#### 32 **What are the principles of the Bentall operation for congenital left ventricular outflow tract lesions including when associated with other congenital cardiac defects?**

• This procedure is mainly used in the adolescent and adult population (adult congenital heart disease [ACHD]), especially in those with aortic regurgitation associated with congenital connective tissue diseases, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Turner syndrome and bicuspid aortic valve-associated aortopathy. Indication and timing of intervention varies between these conditions.

- More uncommon situations may require specific adaptations of the technique to the anatomical variations encountered, such as:
  - a) following the arterial switch operation where 10% of patients develop aortic root dilatation and aortic regurgitation in the 30 year period following the operation. These cases present unique surgical challenges caused by the overriding position of the pulmonary trunk and branches, and the position of the reimplanted coronary arteries, usually on the anterior aspect of the aortic root, and often above the new sinotubular junction (Figure 33);

![](_page_37_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 33. Aortic root dilatation following an arterial switch operation. Note the anteroposterior position of the great vessels, with the main pulmonary artery overriding the aorta. Both coronary ostia are superiorly displaced positioned between the pulmonary trunk and the neo-aorta (red insert). RPA = right pulmonary artery; LPA = left pulmonary artery; Ao = aorta. MPA = main pulmonary artery; RCA = right coronary artery; LMCA = left main coronary artery.**

b) following repair of truncus arteriosus, double-outlet right ventricle (DORV) and Rastelli operation — where the aortic annulus is often partially constituted by the VSD patch used at

- the time of the initial repair. Over time, these patches calcify and can be very difficult to suture into, making the root replacement technically challenging;
- c) aortic root replacement in the context of a single ventricle, following a Fontan operation — where the coronary arteries may be difficult to locate, especially after previous Norwood reconstruction;
- d) aortic root replacement in the context of situs inversus, isomerism and arterial malposition — where particular attention should be paid to the origin and course of the coronary arteries.

All operations are performed on cardiopulmonary bypass and may require deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.

#### 33 **What are the principles of <sup>a</sup> valve-sparing root replacement?**

- Aortic valve insufficiency can occur due to aortic root or annular dilatation. In these cases, the aortic valve may be tricuspid or bicuspid and regurgitation is solely due to failure of coaptation of the leaflets which have been pulled apart by the dilatation of the root.
- Such structurally intact aortic valves can be preserved to avoid replacement in a young population by bringing the leaflets back into coaptation through root reduction.
- Valve-sparing operations aim to reduce the risk of aneurysmassociated complications (dissection and rupture) by replacing the aortic root, whilst preserving the aortic valve and resuspending it within the newly replaced root. There are two commonly used techniques and modifications (Table 3).

- The David V reimplantation technique includes the following steps:
  - a) the sinuses of Valsalva are resected;
  - b) the coronary ostia are harvested in a button fashion;
  - c) a Dacron® tube is sleeved over the three commissures, which are suspended at the appropriate height above the annular plane of the tube;
  - d) interrupted sutures are used to anchor the Dacron® tube to the aortic annulus;
  - e) continuous sutures are used to attach the edges of the resected sinuses to the tube;
  - f) coronary artery buttons are reimplanted in their respective sinuses;
  - g) the Dacron® tube is anastomosed distally to the ascending aorta or aortic arch.
- Some modifications reproduce the reduction of diameter at the level of the neo sinotubular junction with interrupted sutures. Alternatively, appropriate designed tube grafts can be used, already containing a sinus-like proximal end of the graft.
- The Yacoub remodelling technique includes the following steps:
  - a) the sinuses are resected;
  - b) the coronary ostia are harvested in a button fashion;
  - c) the proximal end of a Dacron® tube graft is incised and tailored to replace the sinuses;
  - d) continuous sutures are used to attach the edges of the resected sinuses to the tube;
  - e) coronary artery buttons are reimplanted in their respective sinuses;
  - f) the Dacron® tube is anastomosed distally to the distal aorta where it is normal diameter.
- As the aortic valve and annulus remain outside the graft in the Yacoub remodelling technique, the annulus remains at risk of continued dilatation.
- Some modifications reproduce the reduction of the new sinotubular junction with interrupted sutures.
- Indicators of early failure include inappropriate patient selection, the need for cusp repair and coronary reimplantation.

#### 34 **What is personalised external aortic root support (Figure 34)?**

• Personalised external aortic root support (PEARS) is an operative procedure that can be used in patients where there is root dilatation and minimal or mild aortic regurgitation, as sometimes seen in Marfan syndrome and similar aortopathies.

**Figure 34. Personalised external aortic root support (PEARS) procedure: A) a 3D model of the patient's aortic root and ascending aorta is made from CT images; B) allowing the matching polymer mesh jacket to be made based on the 3D model; C) the jacket is placed around the aortic root and ascending aorta and the seam seen extending along the length of the jacket is sutured closed; D) the MRI images demonstrate the aorta of the first patient (who had Marfan syndrome) 10 years apart confirming no further dilatation. BCA = brachiocephalic artery; LCA = left coronary artery; RCA = right coronary artery.**

- It involves creation of a 'jacket' to fit perfectly around the dilated portion of the aortic root thereby providing support and protection against further dilatation and rupture.
- The jacket is made of polymer mesh moulded on a 3D model created from CT scanning of the patient's aortic root, ascending aorta, and arch, if necessary. There is an axial seam to enable fitting which is closed after the jacket is in place.
- The jacket is placed such that it attaches where the aorta connects to the LV outflow. It must be inserted below the coronary ostia and then extends up around and just beyond the innominate artery where it is loosely sutured to the aortic adventitia. If necessary, it can be extended to cover the arch as far as the left subclavian. The axial seam is then sutured closed.
- The jacket can be made smaller than the patient's aorta by up to 20% less than the actual size and fitted using controlled hypotension under anaesthesia.
- By using a jacket smaller than the patient's aorta, mild regurgitation has been successfully abolished or significantly reduced in all cases.
- The operation is usually performed without cardiopulmonary bypass on a beating heart.
- The first operation was performed 16 years ago and so far, there have been no cases of subsequent rupture or dissection in over 200 cases. Operative mortality is at 1% in experienced hands.

## 35 What are the complications of surgery on the left ventricular outflow tract?

- Bleeding.
- Heart block due to damage of the bundle of His.
- Residual stenosis or recurrent stenosis, especially the subaortic membrane, and tunnel LVOTO.
- Postoperative low cardiac output often due to poor LV diastolic compliance, especially if endocardial fibroelastosis is present, even if resected.
- Aortic regurgitation, due to leaflet prolapse following commissural incision.
- Aneurysm formation from patch dilatation after supravalvular repair.
- Myocardial ischaemia from coronary distortion in supravalvular aortic stenosis repair.

#### 36 **What are the long-term results following surgery for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction?**

- Outcomes are dependent on initial morphology, severity of obstruction, age at which intervention is needed, and case selection. Comparisons between treatment options may not therefore be valid and figures below are usually best-case scenarios.
- Neonatal aortic valve stenosis treated by:
  - a) balloon dilatation:
    - i) 70% survival at 10 years;
    - ii) 26% freedom from reintervention at 10 years;
    - iii) 61% freedom from moderate AR at 10 years;
  - b) open surgical valvotomy:
    - i) 70-90% survival at 10 years;
    - ii) 66-78% freedom from reintervention at 10 years;
    - iii) up to 90% freedom from moderate AR at 10 years (very dependent on case selection).

#### • Ross operation in infancy:

- a) operative mortality <10% (with older children and young adults 1-3%);
- b) 95% survival at 5 years;
- c) freedom from AR 90% at 2 years and 70% at 5 years;
- d) freedom from reintervention 37% at 5 years (mostly RV-PA conduit replacement).

#### • Supravalvular aortic stenosis:

- a) operative mortality of 2-3%;
- b) residual gradient in 15-20%, mainly due to diffuse stenosis;
- c) survival at 10 years 80%;
- d) freedom from late reoperation 90% at 10 years and 80% at 20 years.

#### • Discrete subaortic stenosis:

- a) low operative mortality <5%;
- b) reoperation in 10-15% of cases;
- c) late AR in up to 20% of cases;
- d) 10-year survival >90%.

• Tunnel LVOTO. Although the heterogeneity of morphology and age at the first operation make statistics on operative mortality, long-term survival and reoperation rate unreliable, intervention carries greater operative risk, and decreased freedom from late death and reoperation than discrete subaortic stenosis.
