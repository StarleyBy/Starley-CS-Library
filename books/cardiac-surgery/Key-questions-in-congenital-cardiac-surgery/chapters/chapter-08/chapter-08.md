### Paediatric cardiac intensive care

**Michael J. Griksaitis, Melanie A. Connett**

- 1 **What are the principles of practice for <sup>a</sup> cardiac intensive care unit?**
- Cardiac intensive care units are highly specialised units providing intensive care to a wide range of clinical scenarios and needs.
- Some hospitals operate specialised cardiac intensive care (paediatric and adult) and some care for patients with cardiac disease as part of the general intensive care practice.
- Regardless of the structural model, specialists in cardiac intensive care are called to deal with a child or adult with a cardiac condition, admitted:
  - a) with an acute medical problem including stabilisation prior to cardiotomy;
  - b) following cardiac operations and/or catheter-based procedures (diagnostic or therapeutic, electrophysiology interventions);
  - c) after non-cardiac surgery.
- This chapter will focus on children with cardiac conditions, with the principles of intensive care for the adult congenital heart disease population described in the following chapter.

#### **Table 1** *continued***. Common monitoring tools used in the paediatric intensive care unit.**

#### Left atrial pressure (LAP)

LA pressure lines are left áå ëáíì following certain congenital cardiac surgical procedures (e.g. arterial switch). The pressure reading is a surrogate marker for the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and gives an indicator of LV preload, contractility and afterload. Normal LAP is slightly higher than the RAP (measured via the CVP) at 5-10mmHg. LAP lines are not routinely left áå ëáíì as they are associated with risks of air entrainment or thromboembolic events directly to the systemic circulation and bleeding on removal. If an air bubble is seen in the line it must be clamped immediately and action taken.

Pulse oximeter saturation levels (SpO2)

This is a standard monitoring tool and uses the transmission of light at two different frequencies through pulsatile tissues to assess the oxygen saturation levels of haemoglobin. The original calibration means that SpO2 accuracy is less with extremes of hypoxia (<80%). The pulse oximeter waveform also informs the intensivist to the tissue perfusion; a poor waveform or detection of trace can imply poor pulsatility in the distal tissues. With improving cardiac output and tissue perfusion the pulse oximeter trace improves. Direct arterial blood gas analysis is the most accurate way of determining oxygen saturation levels and is of importance when caring for the singleventricle cyanotic child for Qp:Qs assessment.

Cardiac output (CO) monitors

Cardiac output monitoring is a helpful tool to measure the CO and tissue oxygen delivery. Traditionally this was used using pulmonary artery catheters. However, for many reasons this technique is rarely used in the PICU. Modern CO monitors use a variety of methods including pulse pressure analysis, bioimpedance, Doppler measurements or the applied Fick principle to calculate the CO. From these, the machines often give (indexed) recordings of cardiac output, stroke volume, systemic vascular resistance and cardiac contractility. These machines can be inaccurate, so often it is the trends in values that are more helpful and need to be used in conjunction with the clinical assessment of the child.

## Table 1 continued. Common monitoring tools used in the paediatric intensive care unit.

End-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (ETCO<sub>2</sub>)

 $\rm ETCO_2$  is mandatory monitoring for any ventilated patient on the ICU. It measures the  $\rm CO_2$  concentration at the end of expiration (normally 35-45mmHg or 4.6-5.9kPa) and this approximately correlates to the  $\rm PaCO_2$  (there is a slight difference due to alveolar dead space). Therefore,  $\rm ETCO_2$  is helpful in: monitoring the effectiveness of gas exchange and adequacy of mechanical ventilation; confirming and monitoring endotracheal tube position; assessment of cardiac output by monitoring for pulmonary blood flow; and monitoring of metabolic demand.

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)

NIRS monitoring is a method of monitoring regional tissue oxygenation using infrared probes placed over the tissue of interest. Typically NIRS is measured on both cerebral hemispheres to ensure adequate cerebral oxygenation. This is particularly helpful if on VA ECMO the carotid artery is cannulated. The NIRS probe can also be placed on the kidney giving a cerebral-renal NIRS difference and can be helpful to ensure adequate cardiac output and detect falling cardiac output.

Amplitude integrated electroencephalography (aEEG)

Cerebral function monitors exist to measure a reduced number of EEG channels. This data is then processed, filtered and presented on a semi-logarithmic scale as an aEEG, with one trace for each cerebral hemisphere. This allows the bedside team to monitor for changes in electrocortical activity, for example, with seizures or encephalopathy.

Bispectral index (BIS)

BIS monitors are used to assess for the depth of sedation or anaesthesia. The lower the number the more sedated the patient.

#### 3 Describe the principles of stabilising a neonate with a duct-dependent systemic circulation

- Lesions that require the ductus arteriosus ('duct') to supply the systemic circulation include critical aortic stenosis, interrupted aortic arch, coarctation of the aorta and hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
- Whilst many of these can be diagnosed antenatally, some do not present clinically until the duct has closed, at around day 5 to 14 of life.

- As the duct closes, the systemic cardiac output, and therefore tissue oxygen delivery, is critically impaired.
- These neonates present in various degrees of cardiogenic shock with poor peripheral pulses, a heart murmur, hepatomegaly, respiratory distress, acidosis, lacticaemia and multiorgan failure.
- Monitoring can show a difference between the pre-ductal (right arm) and post-ductal (lower limb) blood pressures and pulse oximetry, depending on the site of the lesion. During resuscitation, it is the pre-ductal blood pressure/pulse oximetry that is of interest as this is measuring the perfusion to the coronary arteries and brain.
- The mainstay of management is to restore systemic perfusion by reopening the duct and allowing the end-organ perfusion to improve prior to undergoing relevant cardiac surgery.
- The key intervention to reopen the duct is the use of prostaglandin. The effect of prostaglandin is dose-dependent, with low doses (5- 10ng/kg/min) used to maintain an open duct and higher doses (20- 50ng/kg/min) needed to reopen a closing duct. In some circumstances, doses up to 100ng/kg/min are needed for a short period of time to re-establish systemic flow, which can be confirmed by return of peripheral pulses and resolution of shock.
- The main side effects of prostaglandin are dose-dependent and include apnoea, pyrexia and vasodilatation (which may lead to hypotension).
- Other interventions needed to support the neonate include, but are not limited to:
  - a) intubation with ventilation and appropriate ongoing sedation;
  - b) full monitoring with adequate venous and arterial access;
  - c) inotropic support (often in the form of adrenaline or dopamine);
  - d) correction of electrolyte disturbances;
  - e) support of end-organ function, such as with renal replacement therapy;
  - f) consideration of neurological injury, depending on the clinical state that the neonate presented;
  - g) assessing for associated pathologies, such as sepsis and genetic syndromes.
- These interventions facilitate further assessment and organ recovery prior to surgery.
- The duct will almost always reopen and provides the intensive care team time to optimise the neonate's physiology before surgery. If the

duct cannot be reopened, however, then urgent surgery may be indicated.

#### 4 **Describe the principles of stabilising <sup>a</sup> neonate with <sup>a</sup> duct-dependent pulmonary circulation**

- The most common lesions that require the duct to supply the pulmonary circulation include critical pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary atresia (with or without a ventricular septal defect) and tetralogy of Fallot with severe right ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
- Whilst many of these can be diagnosed antenatally, some do not present until the duct has closed at around day 5 to 14 of life.
- As the duct closes, there is reduced blood flow to the pulmonary artery and lungs, causing inadequate oxygenation of the blood, and a right-to-left shunt, ultimately causing cyanosis.
- These neonates present with varying degrees of cyanosis, usually identified by pulse oximetry. Many are not in physiological distress.
- These neonates tend to fail the so called 'hyperoxia test'. High O2 concentration ventilation is used to gauge the response in saturations. There may be a small improvement in oxygen saturation levels due to the reduction of pulmonary artery pressures, or any associated V/Q mismatch, but the neonate remains cyanotic.
- As the duct closes, or with increasing degrees of obstruction to the right ventricular outflow tract, there will be increasing cyanosis. Often the systemic cardiac output is maintained but with increasing hypoxia there is impaired tissue oxygenation delivery and acidosis causing the child to deteriorate (Figure 1).
- The aim of management is to restore pulmonary perfusion by reopening the duct. Although this will not normalise the oxygen saturation levels, it will ensure adequate pulmonary blood flow and mixing.
- As for systemic duct-dependent circulations, the key intervention is the use of prostaglandin to reopen the duct.
- Although many neonates will tolerate the hypoxia, intubation and ventilation is indicated if the patient demonstrates:
  - a) signs of shock;
  - b) acidosis and lacticaemia;
  - c) profound cyanosis;
  - d) apnoea, as a side effect of the prostaglandin.
- Other interventions needed to support the neonate include good general intensive care measures and organ support.

**Figure 1. Characteristics and aetiology of systemic and pulmonary duct-dependent circulations.**

- The duct will usually reopen, which provides the intensive care team time to optimise the neonate's physiology before surgery. If the duct cannot be reopened, however, then urgent surgery may be indicated with fully corrective surgery or a systemic to pulmonary shunt, such as a modified Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt, to temporarily improve pulmonary blood flow.
- Other conditions can cause cyanosis, without being solely dependent on the duct, such as transposition physiology or common mixing defects.
- 5 **How can persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn be differentiated from cyanotic congenital heart disease?**
- Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a common problem for neonatologists that reflects the failure of the foetal circulation to transition to the postnatal circulation.
- It results in elevated pulmonary artery pressures, an ongoing right-toleft shunt through the duct and foramen ovale with persistent

- hypoxia, causing further worsening of the pulmonary pressure and right heart failure.
- PPHN can be an isolated phenomenon but it is also associated with:
  - a) congenital diaphragmatic hernia;
  - b) cystic congenital adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) of the lung;
  - c) pulmonary hypoplasia;
  - d) meconium aspiration syndrome;
  - e) sepsis/congenital infections;
  - f) birth asphyxia;
  - g) many other pathologies.
- Unlike primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension seen outside the neonatal period, no absolute value of pulmonary artery pressure defines PPHN.
- It can be challenging to distinguish PPHN from cyanotic congenital heart disease in the acute setting when there is no obvious cause for PPHN (Table 2).

• The fundamental criterion in use is the exclusion of congenital heart disease using echocardiography as the gold standard diagnostic tool. Unless carried out by an expert sonographer, however, it is

- possible to miss important and treatable causes of PPHN, such as obstructed total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC).
- Management of PPHN is similar to the management of pulmonary hypertension. Isolated PPHN may be an indication for extracorporeal life support, as it is a reversible pathology.

#### 6 **What are the principles of pre-operative management of a neonate with single-ventricle physiology?**

- The majority of patients with functionally single-ventricle anatomy are most often diagnosed antenatally. At that point, counselling and planning for postnatal management, including a suitable site of delivery, can take place.
- Diagnosis is rarely made postnatally, but in such cases, children are likely to present with cardiogenic shock and/or cyanosis.
- The aim of care is to ensure a suitable balance between pulmonary perfusion and systemic perfusion (Qp:Qs = 0.7-1:1), which is usually monitored by oxygen saturation levels. Levels of approximately 75- 80% with good clinical signs of systemic perfusion are ideal.
- To ensure a balanced Qp:Qs, there must be:
  - a) an unrestrictive interatrial communication, secundum atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale;
  - b) a patent duct of adequate size for the body surface area;
  - c) a balance between pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (Figure 2).
- For the majority of neonates, during the period of high PVR, maintaining duct patency with prostaglandin E2 and careful monitoring to ensure a balanced Qp:Qs is sufficient and additional medical intervention can potentially worsen the imbalance.
- Upon the fall of PVR in the following days after birth, excessive pulmonary blood flow with a subsequent fall in systemic blood flow (elevated Qp:Qs) can occur. This is demonstrated by high oxygen saturation levels, respiratory distress (due to pulmonary oedema), poor peripheral perfusion with a lacticaemia and low central venous saturation. This imbalance is further worsened if the SVR also rises (Figure 3). If this scenario occurs, intervention is required.
- ICU interventions are designed to rebalance the Qp:Qs to 1:1 or slightly lower. It is important to ensure that the atrial septum is nonrestrictive, which may require an urgent balloon atrial septostomy.

- If the Qp:Qs ratio is high, associated with excessive pulmonary blood flow, management includes:
  - a) increasing the PVR by:
    - i) ventilating to a higher PaCO2, which acts as a pulmonary vasoconstrictor;
    - ii) avoiding oxygen, which is a pulmonary vasodilator;
    - iii) reducing the prostaglandin infusion, if possible, whilst ensuring the duct stays open;
  - b) decreasing the SVR by:
    - i) administering adequate sedation and analgesia;
    - ii) ensuring normothermia;
    - iii) reducing the afterload reduction, such as using milrinone.
- If the Qp:Qs ratio is low with reduced pulmonary blood flow, it would suggest that the duct is closing or has closed, or that the PVR is very high. This scenario is rare pre-operatively but more commonly seen after the Norwood operation.
- Calculating the exact Qp:Qs in these children can be difficult without full monitoring or a diagnostic cardiac catheter. Qp:Qs can be calculated at the bedside of the patient on the PICU using:

Qp:Qs = Aortic saturations – Mixed venous saturations Pulmonary venous saturations – Pulmonary artery saturations

Aortic saturations are measured directly from the arterial blood gas. The mixed venous saturations are assumed to be the same as the central venous saturations, as measured from an internal jugular central venous line.

The pulmonary venous saturations are assumed to be 100%, as there is an assumption that the child has no parenchymal lung disease. Some choose to select a lower number, such as 95-98%, as often these children present with pulmonary oedema or V/Q mismatch.

The pulmonary artery saturations are the same as the aortic saturations, as it is the pulmonary artery that is supplying the systemic circulation in a true single-ventricle system

- Whatever the clinical status of these children, discussion should take place with families to ensure that they understand the implications of single-ventricle surgery and the overall prognosis.
- Surgery is usually performed following the natural fall in the PVR, usually around 7 to 14 days.

#### 7 **What are the principles of pre-operative management of an infant or child with heart failure due to a large left-to-right shunt?**

- Large left-to-right shunts result in high pulmonary blood flow, left ventricular volume loading and heart failure, and may be caused by a:
  - a) large ventricular septal defect (VSD);
  - b) atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD);
  - c) patent ductus arteriosus (PDA);
  - d) aortopulmonary (AP) window.
- Atrial septal defects (ASD) do not usually lead to heart failure until very late in life and almost never in infancy.
- Children with ventricular shunts, PDA and AP window can present with breathlessness, respiratory distress, failure to thrive, hepatomegaly, cardiomegaly or a murmur. The deterioration is often precipitated by:
  - a) falling PVR with increasing age;
  - b) intercurrent infections (typically bronchiolitis in the winter months);
  - c) pulmonary hypertensive episodes, caused by pulmonary pressure or volume overload, especially if there is a delay in recognition or treatment.
- Investigations may show cardiomegaly with signs of pulmonary congestion on chest radiograph or pulmonary oedema on lung ultrasound.
- The management strategy for these patients will vary depending on the severity of the clinical picture, with many of these children managed medically prior to surgery, including:
  - a) treating any intercurrent illness;
  - b) reducing pulmonary oedema with:
    - i) diuretics;
    - ii) positive end-expiratory pressure (either non-invasive or invasive ventilation);
  - c) reducing pulmonary blood flow (by increasing PVR) by:
    - i) reducing the minute ventilation to increase PaCO2;
    - ii) minimising oxygen usage;
  - d) promoting aortic forward flow and reducing the left-to-right shunt by afterload reduction using:
    - i) angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors;

- ii) inodilators, such as milrinone;
- iii) positive pressure ventilation;
- e) optimising nutrition and growth.
- The timing for intervention can then be planned with options including:
  - a) palliative surgery, such as pulmonary artery banding;
  - b) complete surgical or interventional correction.

#### 8 **What are the principles of pre-operative management of an infant or child with cyanosis due to a right-to-left shunt?**

- This group of children typically include tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary atresia with or without a ventricular septal defect.
- The right-to-left shunt results in reduced pulmonary blood flow, with systemic oxygen desaturation and a negative hyperoxia test.
- The right-to-left shunt varies depending on the relationship between the SVR and PVR and the degree of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Children with tetralogy of Fallot can have hypercyanotic episodes ('spells'), where transiently the right-to-left shunt is increased, often due to dynamic worsening of the RVOTO.
- PICU care is required when pulmonary blood flow reaches a critical level, resulting in significant cyanosis, impaired oxygen delivery to tissues and possible neurological symptoms.
- The main aim of PICU care is to improve pulmonary blood flow, which can be achieved by:
  - a) reducing right-to-left shunt by:
    - i) reducing the PVR using oxygen therapy, sedation, muscle relaxation, ventilation to a normal/lower PaCO2 or with inhaled nitric oxide therapy;
    - ii) increasing the SVR using phenylephrine, noradrenaline or vasopressin, or cooling to normothermia;
    - iii) reducing the RVOT obstruction to improve pulmonary artery flow by avoiding acidosis, the use of beta-blockers (such as esmolol), sedation or analgesia, and administering adequate preload with fluids;
  - b) interventional cardiology, including:
    - i) stent insertion, in the RVOT or PDA;
    - ii) balloon valvuloplasty, such as in critical pulmonary stenosis;

- c) cardiac surgery, including:
  - i) temporary shunt insertion, such as a modified BT shunt;
  - ii) partial correction of the defect, such as using a transannular patch;
  - iii) primary correction of the defect, such as tetralogy of Fallot repair;
  - iv) extracorporeal life support pending further decisions.
- 9 **What are the principles of pre-operative management of a neonate or infant with transposition of the great arteries?**
- In transposition of the great arteries (TGA), there are two parallel circulations, with the morphological right ventricle giving rise to the aorta and the morphological left ventricle giving rise to the main pulmonary artery. Without any mixing, this circulation is incompatible with life.
- Mixing in TGA can occur at:
  - a) atrial level (interatrial communications);
  - b) ventricular level (ventricular septal defect);
  - c) arterial level (patent ductus arteriosus).
- TGA is usually an antenatal diagnosis.
- Many neonates with TGA are born with an adequate PFO and a PDA which can be maintained with prostaglandin, allowing adequate mixing. In these patients, critical care is not usually required.
- Some neonates with TGA, however, will have profound cyanosis requiring critical care intervention because of a combination of reasons, including:
  - a) associated pulmonary hypertension during foetal transition;
  - b) restrictive or an intact atrial septum;
  - c) delayed diagnosis with closure of the PDA;
  - d) associated cardiac lesions, such as pulmonary artery stenosis.
- The aim of PICU management is to improve oxygen saturation levels by increasing mixing between the two circulations and treating any additional pathology, such as congenital infections.
- Strategies to improve mixing in this cohort include:
  - a) ensuring ductal patency with prostaglandin;

- b) ensuring unrestricted atrial shunting by:
  - i) percutaneous balloon atrial septostomy (BAS), to remove any mechanical obstruction to mixing;
  - ii) prostaglandin, which is administered to increase pulmonary venous return to elevate the left atrial pressure in order to encourage mixing through the atrial septum;
- c) reducing pulmonary vascular resistance with:
  - i) oxygen therapy;
  - ii) sedation and muscle relaxation;
  - iii) ventilation to achieve a normal or lower PaCO2;
  - iv) inhaled nitric oxide therapy;
- d) increasing systemic vascular resistance with noradrenaline or vasopressin;
- e) treating other associated problems, such as sepsis with antibiotics.
- Acute surgery for TGA is rarely indicated as an unrestrictive atrial septum and a PDA usually provides adequate mixing. In cases of poor response to balloon septostomy and ongoing reduced cardiac output and desaturation, emergency surgery may be indicated.
- Ideally, the neonate will be extubated following the BAS to allow for the normal reduction in PVR to occur in the first week of life, prior to undergoing surgical repair.

#### 10 **What are the principles of management of <sup>a</sup> child presenting with left ventricular failure and dilated cardiomyopathy?**

- Children can present with left ventricular (LV) failure as the primary cardiac pathology (such as myocarditis, cardiomyopathy or congenital heart disease) or as the condition secondary to another critical illness, such as septic shock.
- Children with LV failure will present with varying degrees of low cardiac output states and cardiogenic shock. Acute decompensation can either occur due to worsening of LV function or intercurrent illness, such as lower respiratory tract infections.
- Any critically unwell child with shock or respiratory distress should have a basic bedside assessment of the left ventricle, including:
  - a) echocardiography which can provide a detailed assessment of LV function, rule out structural heart disease and ensure the coronary arteries are assessed, particularly ruling out anomalous coronary artery origins;

- b) electrocardiography (ECG) which can rule out tachyarrhythmia as the cause of LV dysfunction and assess for signs of active or previous ischaemia or infarction (Q waves, ST segment and T wave changes);
- c) blood results which can assess for end-organ perfusion (such as renal function), signs of myocardial infarction (such as troponin) and tissue oxygen delivery (such as lactate or mixed venous oxygen saturation levels);
- d) cardiomyopathy 'screen' which may be indicated to identify any causes of cardiomyopathy, including genetic testing, metabolic assessment and endocrine evaluation.
- Treatment strategy for severe LV dysfunction is aimed at ensuring adequate oxygen delivery to tissues, whilst treating any reversible or underlying causes.
- The medical management strategy specifically for LV failure can be considered in terms of the factors determining cardiac output (Figure 4).

![](_page_15_Figure_7.jpeg)

**Figure 4. Intensive care unit medical management strategies for the failing left ventricle. ACE = angiotensin-converting enzyme.**

- Rapid resolution of LV function with good critical care management usually implies a secondary cardiac cause (e.g. sepsis). Ongoing LV dysfunction in the absence of structural congenital heart disease suggests a primary cardiomyopathy/myocarditis.
- If medical management fails, consideration must be given to the use of mechanical support, either ECMO or ventricular assist devices. The aim of this therapy is to bridge the child to recovery, definitive treatment or transplant. Early discussion with a cardiac transplantation centre is recommended.

#### 11 **What are the main complications seen postcardiotomy and thoracotomy?**

- A systematic approach can be taken to consider the potential common postoperative complications and it can be helpful when identifying and acting upon them on the PICU, including:
  - a) airway:
    - i) iatrogenic pathology from airway management (such as endobronchial intubation or airway oedema);
    - ii) vocal cord palsy (recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy);
    - iii) iatrogenic compression of central airways, especially the main bronchi and trachea, resulting from the operation (especially arch surgery);
  - b) breathing:
    - i) acute lung injury;
    - ii) pneumothorax;
    - iii) pleural effusion;
    - iv) chylothorax (thoracic duct injury);
    - v) atelectasis/collapse;
    - vi) pulmonary oedema;
    - vii) diaphragm palsy (phrenic nerve injury);
  - c) circulation:
    - i) systemic inflammatory response;
    - ii) low cardiac output state;
    - iii) myocardial dysfunction;
    - iv) arrythmias and heart block;
    - v) coagulopathy and bleeding;
    - vi) cardiac tamponade (either from bleeding or myocardial oedema);
    - vii) residual untreated cardiac lesions;
    - viii) new iatrogenic cardiac lesions;
    - ix) thrombosis;

- d) disability:
  - i) pain;
  - ii) stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic);
  - iii) anxiety;
  - iv) delirium/withdrawal;
- e) miscellaneous:
  - i) sepsis such as line sepsis, mediastinitis, wound infection;
  - ii) scarring;
  - iii) pyrexia;
  - iv) hypoglycaemia;
  - v) fluid overload;
  - vi) electrolyte disturbances;
  - vii) acid-base disturbances;
  - viii) renal impairment;
  - ix) multi-organ dysfunction;
  - x) ischaemic colitis;
  - xi) feed intolerance.

#### 12 **What is the management strategy for patients with postoperative bleeding?**

- Many children bleed following cardiopulmonary bypass. The common causes include:
  - a) coagulopathy secondary to an inflammatory and immunological response to surgery and exposure to the extracorporeal circuit, with bypass times >90 minutes associated with a greater risk of bleeding;
  - b) major transfusion intra-operatively;
  - c) consumption of platelets and coagulation factors during cardiopulmonary bypass;
  - d) inadequate heparin reversal;
  - e) haemodilution;
  - f) hypothermia;
  - g) surgical bleeding.
- The management requires a multidisciplinary, systematic approach which can improve patient outcomes, avoid unnecessary use of blood products and prevent surgical re-exploration. Most units use institution-based protocols and major haemorrhage policies.
- The level of intervention needed is dependent on the severity of bleeding and level of cardiovascular compromise. Haemorrhagic shock is a clinical emergency and needs to be managed aggressively and promptly.
- Although the severity of bleeding definition varies, a general rule can be based on chest drain losses in relation to body weight (Table 3).

 Table 3. Classification for severity of bleeding post-cardiopulmonary

 bypass.

| Severity of bleeding                        | Chest drain losses          |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Nil — check drains are not blocked Minimal  | 0<br>1-2mL/kg/hr            |
| Moderate                                    | 2-5mL/kg/hr                 |
| High Very severe — assume surgical bleeding | 5-10mL/kg/hr<br>>10mL/kg/hr |

- The management of bleeding on the PICU includes:
  - a) resuscitation to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to tissues despite blood loss;
  - replacement of lost blood volume which needs to be warmed and a mix of red blood cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate to replace the whole blood lost. Pump blood or cell-saved blood can also be used;
  - c) correction of any residual coagulopathy;
  - d) early antifibrinolytic treatment (tranexamic acid) which has been shown to significantly reduce the need for transfusion with minimal risk of venous thrombosis;
  - e) ensuring normothermia;
  - f) restore ionised calcium to normal levels;
  - g) further reversal of heparin with protamine;
  - h) correcting acidosis;
  - i) considering the possibility of surgical bleeding or cardiac tamponade, which may require chest re-exploration.
- If initial resuscitative measures have failed to control a major haemorrhage, then more potent thrombin generators can be considered including recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa). The administration of rFVIIa should only be used in extreme circumstances and where all surgical sources of bleeding have been corrected. As the use of rFVIIa has been associated with increased adverse events, including arterial thrombi, it should be used with caution.
- Although coagulation studies are useful to direct a focused transfusion strategy, resuscitation should not be delayed waiting for results.
- Only few coagulation tests will provide meaningful information on whole blood function, as the majority of them look at specific parts of the coagulation cascade (e.g. INR, APTTR).

- Two bedside examples of whole blood coagulopathy screens include:
  - a) activated clotting time (ACT) a bedside test of fibrin formation in whole blood that is used to monitor heparin anticoagulation but not specific to it. It provides a limited amount of information about clotting. The normal range for the ACT is seconds;
  - b) thromboelastogram (TEG®) (Figure 5) which can provide a detailed whole blood clotting test to help determine the cause of coagulopathy and thereby guide which blood product to administer. It can be difficult, however, to differentiate between thrombocytopaenia and hypofibrinogenaemia.

#### 13 **What are the characteristic findings and management of a patient with post-cardiotomy low cardiac output state?**

- Low cardiac output state (LCOS) describes a common phenomenon seen on the PICU following congenital cardiac surgery. The cardiac output falls, causing a significant impairment of delivery of oxygen to the tissues.
- LCOS occurs in approximately 25% of children following cardiac surgery. One major study involving 122 neonates undergoing the arterial switch procedure for transposition of the great arteries, showed that 25% had a cardiac index <2L/min/m2. The majority of this occurred hours following admission to the PICU (often postoperative night one), before returning to baseline after 24 hours.
- LCOS occurs because of:
  - a) inflammatory response due to cardiopulmonary bypass;
  - b) myocardial ischaemia due to the presence of the aortic cross-clamp;
  - c) reperfusion injury;
  - d) ventricular injury such as from the ventriculotomy;
  - e) residual cardiac lesions;
  - f) hypovolaemia such as from bleeding or third space fluid loss;
  - g) cardiac tamponade;
  - h) pulmonary hypertension;
  - i) arrhythmia such as junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET);
  - j) drug delivery issues such as inotropes.

#### • The clinical features of LCOS include:

- a) examination findings cool peripheries, weak pulses and a grey/mottled appearance;
- b) observation findings tachycardia, hypotension, reduced urine output and a fall in renal and cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring;
- c) investigation findings, including:
  - i) raised lactate;
  - ii) widening arteriovenous oxygen saturation difference (low SvO2);
  - iii) end-organ injury such as acute kidney injury;
  - iv) fall in cardiac index.
- Many children return from the operating room on a milrinone infusion, based on the PRIMACORP study (PRophylactic Intravenous use of Milrinone After Cardiac OpeRation in Pediatrics), which demonstrated

- that the use of milrinone when compared to placebo reduced the incidence of LCOS and that the reduction in LCOS was more significant with a higher dose of milrinone.
- Upon identifying LCOS, the intensivist must ensure that there is no obvious reversible cause that needs correcting, such as tamponade or a residual lesion. Often, LCOS is a gradual process that is seen over several hours before resolving.
- The general management of LCOS in the absence of reversible causes are focused around ensuring adequate oxygen delivery to the tissues.
- The overall strategy is based on the recognition and correction of the factors determining the oxygen delivery (DO2), which is measured in mL/kg/min, and is directly proportional to CO (cardiac output) and arterial content of oxygen (CaO2) (Figure 6). Therefore, optimising CO and CaO2 directly increases oxygen transport, although it does not affect oxygen uptake at tissue level.

![](_page_21_Figure_6.jpeg)

**Figure 6. Factors determining oxygen delivery. CaO2 = arterial content of oxygen; Hb = haemoglobin; SaO2 = oxygen saturation levels; PaO2 = partial pressure of oxygen; DO2 = oxygen delivery; CO = cardiac output; HR = heart rate; SV = stroke volume; EDV = end-diastolic volume; ESV = end-systolic volume.**

- When looking at CaO2, interventions aimed at affecting the proportion of oxygen dissolved in plasma (PaO2) are not significant, given that the factor of 0.003 by which this is calculated in the overall equation.
- Conversely, haemoglobin (Hb) and oxygen saturation (SaO2) interventions are important in increasing transport.

- Heart rate (HR) is the most important factor in regulating cardiac output, given the small dimensions of the ventricular cavities and the poor compliance of the infant myocardium.
- Manipulations of preload and afterload are very important given the reduced contractility of the young heart, especially in the postoperative setting. Inotropic support is often required after cardiotomy.
- Interventions aimed at regulating the oxygen delivery formula should be considered in a systematic way in every patient after surgery to maximise their effects, including:
  - a) sedation and muscle relaxation (reduces metabolic demand);
  - b) optimising ventilation and oxygenation;
  - c) optimising preload by correcting bleeding, ensuring an adequate haemoglobin, use of fluid boluses according to response;
  - d) optimising contractility using inotropes (such as adrenaline, dopamine), inodilators (such as milrinone) or a calcium infusion;
  - e) optimising afterload by achieving normothermia and using inodilators (such as milrinone) or vasopressors (such as noradrenaline or vasopressin), depending on the SVR;
  - f) supporting end-organ function such as with renal replacement therapy;
  - g) considering steroid therapy such as with hydrocortisone. Glucocorticoids have been used in inotrope-resistant shock in the PICU for many non-cardiac causes. In cardiac children, the baseline cortisol level does not seem to be associated with the response seen. Whilst steroids may improve blood pressure and inotropic requirement, their use has not been associated with improved mortality but does increase morbidity, such as infections;
  - h) extracorporeal life support if LCOS is refractory to medical management.

#### 14 **How is postoperative junctional ectopic tachycardia managed?**

- Arrhythmias occur in around 5-15% of all children undergoing congenital cardiac surgery. Of those, junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) is the most common and problematic.
- The aetiology of JET is believed to be oedema or damage to the bundle of His and surrounding tissues. It generally occurs within the first hours following surgery and is self-limiting, often terminating within days.

- JET can occur after any cardiac surgery, and recognised risk factors include:
  - a) younger infants and neonates;
  - b) low body weight for age;
  - c) longer cardiopulmonary bypass or aortic cross-clamp times;
  - d) use of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest;
  - e) complex surgery;
  - f) anatomical location of intracardiac surgery such as tetralogy of Fallot or AVSD;
  - g) patients with genetic syndromes;
  - h) electrolyte disturbances;
  - i) acidosis;
  - j) use of inotropes.
- JET causes haemodynamic compromise because:
  - a) tachycardia reduces diastolic filling time;
  - b) loss of atrioventricular synchrony;
  - c) increased myocardial oxygen consumption resulting in worsening ventricular function.
- JET can be recognised at the bedside with some characteristic features, including:
  - a) tachycardia (usually over 170bpm);
  - b) change in the central venous pressure (CVP) waveform (canon waves);
  - c) haemodynamic instability such as hypotension;
  - d) features of low cardiac output status.
- The only way to diagnose JET formally is with a 12-lead ECG, including an atrial ECG using the epicardial pacing wires. The ECG features include (Figure 7):
  - a) non-sinus tachycardia;
  - b) QRS morphology which is usually similar to that seen in sinus rhythm;
  - c) atrioventricular dissociation where the ventricular QRS rate is faster than the atrial P wave;
  - d) difficulty in identifying P waves, which are often lost within the QRS complex, unless using an atrial ECG;

![](_page_24_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 7. Typical electrocardiographic rhythm strip of a patient with junctional ectopic tachycardia.**

- e) regular QRS complexes with a fixed R-R interval, although the occasional sinus beat can occur, making the rhythm appear irregular.
- As JET cannot be cardioverted, management is oriented towards heart rate control and restoration of AV synchrony by:
  - a) providing adequate sedation and muscle relaxation to reduce metabolic demand and intrinsic catecholamine release;
  - b) optimising electrolytes, especially magnesium, potassium and calcium;
  - c) correcting acidosis;
  - d) reducing body temperature, initially aiming for normothermia and then cooling down further as needed, which can be achieved with antipyretics, environmental measures or cooling devices. Generally, moderate hypothermia is reached (around 35°C);
  - e) reducing inotropes, especially dopamine, if possible, to reduce any catecholamine-induced tachycardia and myocardial oxygen consumption. A balance needs to be achieved in order to counteract ventricular dysfunction and low cardiac output which require inotropic support. The use of vasopressors may be helpful in patients with systemic inflammatory response and good ventricular function to allow weaning of inotropes;
  - f) administering antiarrhythmic drugs, including:
    - i) alpha agonists (such as clonidine and dexmedetomidine) — which are used to reduce the intrinsic heart rate. Both of these medications additionally provide excellent sedation and display less complications than other available sedative agents;

- ii) amiodarone which can be used to provide rate control by prolonging the duration of the myocardial action potential and refractory period. It does, however, have a demonstrated negative inotropic effect;
- iii) beta-blockers (such as esmolol) which are used to provide rate control by increasing the atrioventricular delay. As they have a powerful negative inotropic effect, they are mainly used prior to consideration of extracorporeal life support;
- g) overdriving with epicardial pacing which can be considered when the JET rate is controlled. The use of overdrive pacing (either AAI or DDD, depending on the situation) is set at approximately beats above the intrinsic JET rate and can promote the return of AV synchrony;
- h) extracorporeal life support (ECLS). ECMO may be indicated if the JET is refractory to the management strategies described above and the child remains in a low cardiac output state with inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues. ECMO supports the cardiac output until the JET resolves spontaneously.

#### 15 **What are the principles for renal replacement therapy post-cardiotomy?**

- Acute kidney injury after congenital cardiac surgery is reported to occur in 20-60% of cases, but is more common with:
  - a) younger age patients;
  - b) low body weight;
  - c) complex surgery (higher RACHS-1 category);
  - d) univentricular or cyanotic defects;
  - e) longer cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp times;
  - f) pre-operative pulmonary hypertension;
  - g) known chronic kidney disease;
  - h) patients who have required pre-operative ventilation, inotropes or PICU admission.
- The literature reports an incidence of 2-7% of children requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) following congenital cardiac surgery, which is associated with an increased mortality.
- The indications for RRT include:
  - a) fluid overload;
  - b) acute kidney injury (if severe);

- c) oliguria or anuria;
- d) profound acidosis;
- e) hyperkalaemia;
- f) acute on chronic renal failure.
- The timing of initiation of RRT is often difficult, as it is important not to start it too late, whilst minimising the time on RRT to avoid risks.
- RRT can be delivered in two main ways:
  - a) peritoneal dialysis (PD) which uses the child's own peritoneum as a filtration membrane with a glucose-based dialysis fluid placed in the abdominal cavity. A temporary PD catheter can be placed in the PICU. The dialysate is instilled and left to allow dialysis across the peritoneum and then drained out before the cycle is repeated. It works best in neonates and smaller infants but becomes less effective with increasing age. The advantages of peritoneal dialysis include:
    - i) being a relatively safe procedure (especially with the use of ultrasound to guide catheter insertion);
    - ii) not requiring vascular access;
    - iii) not requiring anticoagulation;
    - iv) simple to operate equipment;
    - v) efficiency of fluid removal;

The disadvantages of peritoneal dialysis, however, include the:

- i) limited control over clearance;
- ii) haemodynamic instability with intermittent fluid shifts;
- iii) limited use only in neonates and infants in the acute setting;
- iv) limited clearance of electrolytes and metabolic waste products;
- v) need to avoid if any gastrointestinal pathology is present; b) continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT, haemodialysis) — which uses an extracorporeal circuit to drain venous blood from the patient, pass it through a specialised membrane which delivers filtration, dialysis or both, before returning the blood (with the addition of replacement fluid) back to the patient in the same venous line. The advantages of haemodialysis include:
  - i) predetermined fluid removal;
  - ii) consistent clearance of electrolytes and metabolic waste products;
  - iii) continuous and therefore less haemodynamic instability once established;
  - iv) works well in all age groups;

The disadvantages of haemodialysis, however, include the:

- i) requirement for a large venous dialysis catheter;
- ii) requirement for anticoagulation;
- iii) potential for instability on initiation;
- iv) more complex to prescribe and manage than PD;
- v) possibility of 'recirculating' blood.

#### 16 **Describe the principles of managing an infant with <sup>a</sup> postoperative chylothorax**

- Chylothorax represents the presence of lymphatic fluid in the pleural cavity.
- Although postoperative chylothorax in congenital cardiac surgery remains a significant complication, its pathogenesis is complex and not always clearly recognisable.
- Although most post-surgical cases of chylothorax are ascribed to surgical lesions of the lymphatic system within the mediastinum, this is not always the case, as demonstrated by the good results obtained with parietal pleural stripping.
- It is, however, essential to differentiate between chylothorax and a simple pleural effusion, given the very different clinical burden associated with these conditions.
- A postoperative chylothorax is associated with poor nutrition, longer ICU and hospital length of stay, and a greater risk of thromboembolic complications. Refractory chylothorax is associated with weight loss and the need for interventions carry significant morbidity and mortality.
- Pleural chest drain losses are common post-cardiac surgery but if they persist past 48 hours then the possibility of a chylothorax should be considered.
- Early enteral feeding is encouraged to allow early detection. Definitive diagnosis is confirmed by analysis of pleural fluid microscopy, which may demonstrate:
  - a) triglycerides >1.1mmol/L when enterally fed;
  - b) lymphocytes >80%;
  - c) chylomicrons.
- A chylothorax can occur secondary to:
  - a) damage to the central lymphatic system (often the thoracic duct), such as during aortic arch surgery;

- b) elevated systemic venous pressures, associated with the Glenn or Fontan procedure, SVC obstruction or thrombosis, or right ventricular failure;
- c) congenital abnormalities in the lymphatic system.
- The principles of managing a chylothorax include:
  - a) chest drain insertion to remove the effusion;
  - b) treating any reversible causes, such as SVC thrombosis;
  - c) monitoring of biochemical markers, serum proteins and immunoglobulins;
  - d) nutritional management. If tolerated, continue with normal enteral feed (especially breast milk) but if losses increase, then change feed to medium chain triglyceride feed, which is not absorbed via the lymphatic system. If drain losses continue to be high, intravenous parenteral nutrition should be considered. It is important to ensure that a dietician is involved;
  - e) IV octreotide, if the losses are persistently high;
  - f) surgical options which are used in recurring chylothorax and include:
    - i) thoracic duct ligation;
    - ii) pleurodesis;
    - iii) pleurectomy.

#### 17 **What are the principles of intensive care unit postoperative management for a neonate with biventricular anatomy following a palliative operation?**

- Pulmonary artery (PA) banding is a procedure used to limit pulmonary blood flow and is often performed to protect the pulmonary vascular bed from high flow in patients with a large left-toright shunt, until the child is large enough for a full correction of their original lesion.
- Upon return to the PICU, the management strategy will depend on the degree of obstruction produced by the band.
- Loose PA bands, producing mild to moderate obstruction to pulmonary blood flow, are accepted if planned for a long period of time. This will allow the child to grow and with the subsequent increase of cardiac output result in a progressively tighter band. The immediate postoperative management is therefore generally orientated to minimising the left-to-right shunt and reducing pulmonary oedema. If unresponsive, surgical recalibration may be required.

- PA bands producing moderate to severe obstruction may result in right ventricular failure, hypoxia and low cardiac output, especially in the post-bypass setting, associated with myocardial stunning. They may require PVR reducing interventions to increase pulmonary blood flow, inotropic support, and if unresponsive, surgical recalibration.
- Infants following isolated PA banding can generally be extubated quickly, although it is useful to allow a period of time to assess the band's clinical effect.
- Aortopulmonary shunts, such as a modified BT shunt, can be used to provide pulmonary blood flow in situations when a full biventricular repair cannot take place immediately. A key question for the intensivist to determine is whether the BT shunt provides the only source of pulmonary blood flow. It is important to assess shunt dependency, as the consequence of shunt failure would lead to no pulmonary blood flow and rapid arrest.
- Management of the infant post-BT shunt includes:
  - a) appropriate anticoagulation with heparin, which is then converted to aspirin;
  - b) balancing of the circulations;
  - c) rapid extubation, if this was the only procedure performed;
  - d) support nutrition and promote growth prior to the child's definitive surgery.

#### 18 **What are the principles of intensive care unit management for a neonate or infant following surgical repair of transposition of the great arteries?**

- An arterial switch is performed in neonates with ventriculo-arterial discordance but the operation may also include a VSD closure, repair of the atrial septum or PDA closure.
- The two key aspects to consider for PICU management are:
  - a) a neonate undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass;
  - b) reimplantation of the coronary arteries.
- The postoperative complications that can be seen following an arterial switch include:
  - a) standard complications of cardiopulmonary bypass;
  - b) low cardiac output, which typically occurs hours postbypass;
  - c) coronary artery complications;

- d) arrhythmia;
- e) pulmonary hypertension.
- The management of these infants requires appropriate knowledge of the coronary artery perfusion pressure. During systole, the left coronary artery is almost occluded, and most perfusion occurs during diastole. In normal health, the right ventricle is perfused in both systole and diastole due to the lower force of contraction. If the RV pressure is elevated, however, such as with pulmonary hypertension, then the perfusion is only in diastole. Coronary artery perfusion pressure (CAPP) can be approximately calculated using this formula:

Left or right CAPP =

Aortic diastolic BP – Left or right ventricular end-diastolic pressure

In the absence of mitral lesions, LVEDP can be assumed to be equal to the left atrial pressure, which is measured with a direct left atrial line that is inserted in theatre and left áå ëáíì for PICU care.

In the absence of tricuspid lesions, the RVEDP can be assumed to be equal to the CVP, measured by the internal jugular central venous line.

Left CAPP = Aortic diastolic BP – Left atrial pressure

Right CAPP = Aortic diastolic BP – Central venous pressure

- Coronary artery problems are more likely in infants with single coronary systems or coronary arteries with an intramural course.
- The general management strategy of neonates following an arterial switch operation include:
  - a) managing general cardiopulmonary bypass complications;
  - b) monitoring for cardiac ischaemia by assessing ST segments on serial ECGs and regional wall motion on echocardiography;
  - c) managing low cardiac output by:
    - i) milrinone with adrenaline and/or dopamine;
    - ii) reducing metabolic demand with ventilation, sedation and normothermia;
    - iii) consideration of mechanical support, such as ECMO;
  - d) maintaining coronary perfusion pressure by:
    - i) adding a low-dose vasopressor (such as noradrenaline/vasopressin) to prevent diastolic hypotension;

- ii) avoiding fast or large fluid boluses, as they will increase the left atrial pressure and central venous pressure, thereby reducing coronary perfusion;
- e) managing arrhythmias;
- f) administering diuretics, restricting fluid input and consideration of renal replacement therapy;
- g) consideration of cardiac catheterisation for coronary angiography if clinical deterioration or ventricular arrhythmias ensue.

#### 19 **What are the principles of intensive care unit management for a neonate with total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage?**

- Abnormal connections of all four pulmonary veins usually presents in the neonatal age and may present to the PICU prior to surgery.
- The appropriate assessment of the pre-operative clinical status needs to include the presence and severity of possible obstruction to blood drainage from the lungs. This can present at the level of the pulmonary veins, veno-atrial connection or interatrial communication, and will result in pulmonary venous hypertension, pulmonary arterial hypertension, pulmonary oedema, hypoxia and shock.
- In the presence of no or minimal obstruction, there may be increased pulmonary blood flow or signs of congestive cardiac failure.
- Obstructed TAPVC is a true paediatric cardiac surgical emergency, which requires immediate surgical correction, as medical management is only a temporising measure. Non-obstructed TAPVC can be managed with conventional heart failure treatment until surgery.
- Following TAPVC repair surgery, the common problems seen include:
  - a) standard complications of cardiopulmonary bypass;
  - b) pulmonary hypertension crisis;
  - c) persistent residual pulmonary venous obstruction;
  - d) pleural effusion or chylothorax;
  - e) arrhythmias.
- Management strategies for TAPVC repair patients may include:
  - a) managing the general complications of cardiopulmonary bypass;
  - b) careful monitoring and treatment of pulmonary hypertension;
  - c) managing arrhythmias;
  - d) administration of diuretics, fluid restriction or renal replacement therapy;
  - e) managing low cardiac output state.

- 20 **What are the principles of intensive care unit management for a neonate or infant following surgical repair of an anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery?**
- The anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery produces a state of chronic ischaemia during gestation, as the myocardium is perfused with poorly oxygenated blood. The left ventricle can appear dilated and poorly contracting at birth.
- Although elevated PVR immediately after birth can prevent or limit coronary flow steal into the pulmonary circulation, when PVR does drop, the myocardium is not only poorly oxygenated but is also poorly perfused.
- This often leads to acute myocardial ischaemia or infarction, with a dilated poorly functioning left ventricle and mitral regurgitation, either physiological or due to papillary muscle infarction.
- Many of these children may already be on the PICU pre-operatively due to their poor clinical status. This makes them a high-risk group of patients.
- The postoperative issues that can be seen include:
  - a) general complications of cardiopulmonary bypass;
  - b) low cardiac output which may be related due to the poor LV function pre-operatively, as well as the effect of cardiopulmonary bypass;
  - c) coronary artery spasm or anatomical issues with the reimplantation;
  - d) mitral valve regurgitation;
  - e) arrhythmia which are often atrial or nodal rhythms. If VF or VT ensure, it is important to ensure that there are no underlying coronary perfusion problems.
- The general management strategy of neonates following surgical repair of an anomalous coronary artery include:
  - a) managing the general complications of cardiopulmonary bypass;
  - b) monitoring for cardiac ischaemia by assessing ST segments on serial ECGs and regional wall motion on echocardiography;
  - c) managing low cardiac output by:
    - i) milrinone with adrenaline and/or dopamine;
    - ii) reducing metabolic demand with ventilation, sedation and normothermia;
    - iii) consideration of mechanical support, such as ECMO;
  - d) maintaining coronary perfusion pressure;

- e) managing arrhythmias;
- f) administering diuretics, restricting fluid input and consideration of renal replacement therapy;
- g) consideration of cardiac catheterisation for coronary angiography if the clinical condition deteriorates or ventricular arrhythmias ensue.
- 21 **What are the principles of intensive care unit management for a neonate or infant with a fully repaired left-to-right shunt?**
- Following closure of a left-to-right shunt, the circulation should return to normal.
- Postoperative concerns relate to the consequences of pre-operative high pulmonary blood flow.
- The expected complications of these operations include:
  - a) standard complications of cardiopulmonary bypass;
  - b) pulmonary hypertension (either persistent or as a crisis), with an increased risk in cases of:
    - i) high pre-operative Qp:Qs;
    - ii) smaller neonates or infants;
    - iii) delayed closure of the shunt;
    - iv) pre-operative heart failure;
    - v) trisomy 21;
    - vi) pulmonary hypoplasia and possible associated upper airway obstruction;
    - vii) Eisenmenger syndrome (reversal of left-to-right shunt secondary to pulmonary hypertension);
  - c) arrhythmias and heart block;
  - d) residual lesions.
- The management is partly related to the degree of pre-operative heart failure, the risk of pulmonary hypertension and the age or size of the child.
- All children require diuresis.
- Low-pressure, high-volume shunts, such as atrial septal defects, AVSD with no ventricular component, unobstructed TAPVC, PAPVC, are at a low risk of complications and can often be extubated quickly with minimal challenges.
- Children with pressure-loading shunts, such as VSD, multiple VSD, complete AVSD, AP window and truncus arteriosus, often require milrinone post-cardiopulmonary bypass.

- Those at a higher risk of pulmonary hypertension may require ventilation for a longer period of time to observe for stability. Signs of pulmonary hypertension can then be managed accordingly.
- 22 **What are the principles of intensive care unit management for a patient with a fully repaired rightto-left shunt and restrictive right ventricular physiology?**
- Restrictive right ventricular physiology results from a right ventricle with severe diastolic dysfunction that is stiff, non-compliant, with small intracavitary volume. It is characterised by end-diastolic antegrade flow during atrial contraction in the main pulmonary artery, as seen on Doppler echocardiography.
- This physiology is typically seen in patients following repair of tetralogy of Fallot and it is often the result of underlying RV hypertrophy and the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass.
- A restrictive RV results in:
  - a) impaired diastolic filling that produces reducing stroke volume and forward cardiac output;
  - b) central venous hypertension as a result of high right atrial pressures and RVEDP;
  - c) poor end-organ perfusion as a result of the reduced pressure gradient, especially in the kidneys and gut.
- The main complications seen after corrective surgery of these lesions includes:
  - a) standard complications of cardiopulmonary bypass;
  - b) residual lesions, such as:
    - i) pulmonary regurgitation (especially with the use of a transannular RVOT patch);
    - ii) residual RVOT obstruction;
    - iii) residual shunts;
    - iv) tricuspid valve dysfunction;
  - c) arrhythmias, especially JET;
  - d) low cardiac output which is worsened by restrictive RV physiology, residual lesions (PR, RVOTO, VSD) and reduced RV systolic function (if a ventriculotomy was performed);
  - e) pulmonary hypertension;
  - f) pleural effusion or chylothorax.

- The management considerations will vary for these children depending on the age or size of the patient, degree of RVOTO/RV hypertrophy and the surgery performed, and may include:
  - a) managing the general complications of cardiopulmonary bypass;
  - b) observing for and rapidly treating any arrhythmias. The tachycardia with JET is not well tolerated due to the diastolic impairment and subsequent reduced filling of the RV;
  - c) ventilation considerations, such as ventilation with the lowest possible mean airway pressure to maintain adequate gas exchange is useful, especially as positive pressure ventilation may exacerbate RV afterload;
  - d) optimising preload (important due to the RV restrictive physiology) with the judicious use of fluids and vasopressors, such as noradrenaline or vasopressin;
  - e) using inodilators, such as milrinone, to help improve a low cardiac output state, as well as providing lusitropic properties for the right ventricle;
  - f) ensuring any chylothorax or pleural effusions are evacuated;
  - g) providing adequate diuresis, including early renal replacement therapy.
- 23 **What are the principles of intensive care unit management for a neonate or infant following a Norwood operation, with either a modified BT shunt or Sano shunt?**
- The Stage I Norwood operation includes:
  - a) atrial septectomy;
  - b) reconstruction of the aortic arch;
  - c) creation of the neo-aorta;
  - d) systemic to pulmonary shunt (modified BT or Sano).
- The key principle of managing an infant following a Stage I Norwood procedure is to ensure an adequate cardiac output with a balanced Qp:Qs and to deal with the standard complications of cardiopulmonary bypass.
- It is generally considered that the Sano modification provides a more stable haemodynamic behaviour on the PICU postoperatively when compared to the modified BT shunt. The main reason for the apparent advantage of the Sano modification is attributed to the fact

that in this case pulmonary flow is systolic and does not affect diastolic pressure in the systemic circulation. As a result, flow distribution is not completely reliant on the difference in vascular resistance between the two circulations, and coronary flow is superior as it is not affected by the drop in mean arterial pressure, as with the BT shunt.

- A Sano procedure, however, is not completely immune to problems with balancing Qp:Qs in the immediate postoperative period nor does it seem to provide a significant net advantage to longer-term morbidity or mortality of the patient.
- Issues that can occur with either shunt include:
  - a) standard complications of cardiopulmonary bypass, but in particular:
    - i) low cardiac output state;
    - ii) cardiac tamponade (the chest is often left open electively);
    - iii) myocardial dysfunction;
  - b) high pulmonary blood flow, as a result of:
    - i) high SVR due to insufficient inodilation, pain, hypothermia or spontaneous fluctuations;
    - ii) low PVR due to hypocarbia, too high FiO2, BTS/BSA mismatch or excessive pulmonary vasodilation;
  - c) low pulmonary blood flow, as a result of:
    - i) shunt obstruction or even blockage;
    - ii) pulmonary hypertension episodes, often spontaneous;
  - d) anatomical complications, such as:
    - i) pulmonary venous drainage obstruction;
    - ii) residual aortic arch narrowing;
    - iii) atrioventricular valve regurgitation;
    - iv) neo-aortic valve regurgitation;
  - e) non-cardiac complications, such as:
    - i) ischaemic colitis;
    - ii) sepsis.
- Multimodal monitoring of these infants is mandatory to guide adequate oxygen delivery treatment. This is typically in the form of standard continuous monitoring of parameters such as ECG, BP, CVP, oxygen saturations, end-tidal CO2, NIRS of cerebral oxygen saturation, urinary output, blood lactate levels, and arteriovenous saturation gradient to allow the calculation of Qp:Qs directly, assuming normal lung oxygenation.
- It is important to understand that isolated arterial blood desaturation can be precipitated by several causes, including:
  - a) decreased pulmonary blood flow and reduced O2 pick-up;

- b) reduced mixed venous saturation;
- c) pulmonary venous desaturation, as a result of poor lung function.
- The general management strategy for these infants includes:
  - a) managing the general complications of cardiopulmonary bypass;
  - b) balancing Qp:Qs, by maintaining an adequate PVR-SVR gradient (ideally, in the postoperative setting the Qp:Qs should be <1);
  - c) reducing metabolic demand (ventilation, sedation, normothermia);
  - d) leaving the chest open postoperatively, with delayed chest closure;
  - e) using an adequate inodilator (often milrinone, later converted to an ACE inhibitor);
  - f) administering heparin to prevent shunt blockage (later converted to aspirin);
  - g) maintaining adequate haemoglobin concentration;
  - h) avoiding the use of jugular central venous access to preserve central vessels for the later surgery;
  - i) delaying feeding because of the risk of ischaemic colitis, with the early use of parenteral nutrition if enteral feeds are not tolerated or in the presence of any known gastrointestinal abnormalities;
  - j) consideration of repeating the echocardiogram, ECG and diagnostic cardiac catheter, if difficulties managing the physiology arise;
  - k) using VA ECMO support, if inadequate oxygen delivery cannot be medically optimised.

#### 24 **What are the principles of intensive care unit management for a neonate or infant following a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt (BCPS)?**

- The second stage of the single-ventricle palliation pathway is to redirect the upper body systemic venous return (unilateral or bilateral SVCs) to the pulmonary circulation bypassing the heart. In the same operation, a few procedures are undertaken, including:
  - a) takedown of the BT or Sano shunt;
  - b) repair of the branch pulmonary arteries (if required);
  - c) SVC(s) to pulmonary artery branch anastomosis ('Glenn shunt');

- d) repair of any additional pathologies, such as atrioventricular valve regurgitation.
- The aim of this procedure is to reduce the volume loading of the right ventricle and is often performed in the first 3 to 6 months of life. It can also be used for a 1½-ventricle repair, such as with Ebstein's anomaly.
- Before performing this operation, a diagnostic cardiac catheter is often undertaken to ensure the pulmonary vascular resistance is low, as the SVC to PA drainage is driven by minimal pressure gradients and inspiratory passive flow.
- The postoperative issues seen following BCPS include:
  - a) standard complications of cardiopulmonary bypass;
  - b) sinoatrial node injury;
  - c) SVC syndrome, either mechanical due to obstruction or physiological due to pulmonary hypertension;
  - d) pleural effusion or chylothorax;
  - e) arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) affecting circulation, such as systemic steal or pulmonary overflow.
- General management of a child post-Glenn/BCPS includes:
  - a) managing the general complications of cardiopulmonary bypass;
  - b) appropriate use of pacing (often AAI) for sinoatrial node dysfunction;
  - c) appropriate head positioning (30° head elevation) to promote passive venous drainage through the SVC;
  - d) anticoagulation (heparin or aspirin), especially in patients with bilateral BCPS, where the section of the pulmonary artery between the anastomoses can develop thrombi due to turbulent flow;
  - e) administering milrinone, though significant inotropic support is often not required;
  - f) ensuring adequate preload to maintain venous drainage to the pulmonary arteries;
  - g) using 'permissive hypercapnia' (and a mild respiratory acidosis); the hypercapnia causes the cerebral vessels to vasodilate and increase blood flow to the head and neck, thereby resulting in an increased venous return (preload) to the SVC. The increased SVC flow has to be balanced against the possible increase in PVR as a result of hypercapnia;
  - h) using minimal ventilation pressures (without causing atelectasis) — with the lowest peak inspiratory pressure,

PEEP and shortest inspiratory times as possible; spontaneous breathing modes on the ventilator as soon as possible; minimising intrathoracic pressure to promote SVC blood flow to the PA;

- i) aiming to extubate early but only when clinically ready. Whilst early extubation can promote the passive, lung-bound cavopulmonary blood flow during inspiration, other benefits of positive pressure ventilation, such as support of ventricular function, will be lost;
- j) removing jugular central venous lines as soon as possible to reduce the risk of thrombosis within the shunt;
- k) delaying chest drain removal until it is evident that they are no longer draining.
- In the scenario of persistent hypoxia, the management includes:
  - a) increasing the FiO2;
  - b) avoiding hyperventilation and ensuring a higher PaCO2;
  - c) ensuring the Glenn shunt and branch pulmonary arteries are patent with no clot or stenosis, either using echocardiography or a cardiac catheter;
  - d) ensuring that there are no pathologies affecting ventilation, such as atelectasis or pleural effusion;
  - e) consideration of inhaled nitric oxide;
  - f) consideration of a diagnostic cardiac catheterisation to look for collateral vessels or arteriovenous malformations that may benefit from coiling.

#### 25 **What are the principles of intensive care unit management for a neonate or infant following a total cavopulmonary connection?**

- The final stage of the univentricular anatomy palliation is the completion of the Fontan circulation, by connecting the IVC directly to the pulmonary arteries, via an extracardiac conduit which can be placed in the pericardial fossa or less commonly an intracardiac conduit (Figure 8).
- In some centres, a fenestration or communication is opened between the conduit and the adjacent wall of the atrial mass. This allows the preload to increase to the systemic ventricle if the pulmonary vascular resistance rises, thus reducing the pulmonary blood flow at the expense of augmented volume and pressure in the systemic venous reservoir. Whilst this will maintain cardiac output, it does lead to systemic desaturation.

- The Fontan circuit is usually completed in older childhood, as the proportion of venous return to the systemic ventricle from the lower body increases.
- The completion of a Fontan circulation allows for better systemic oxygenation and reduction of volume loading on the systemic ventricle.
- Postoperative complications following total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) include:
  - a) standard complications following cardiopulmonary bypass;
  - b) systemic inflammatory response and hypovolaemia which produces a more profound clinical impact due to full venous return depending on passive flow. This can be recognised by low PA pressures, which are measured through the central venous line, with a low common atrial pressure;
  - c) arrhythmias either sinoatrial node dysfunction or nodal tachycardias;
  - d) high pulmonary vascular resistance which can be recognised by high PA pressures (that are measured through the central venous line) with a low common atrial pressure. If there is a fenestration, the child will also demonstrate increasing hypoxia;
  - e) ventricular dysfunction which can be recognised by high PA pressures and a high common atrial pressure;
  - f) pleural effusions;
  - g) persistent hypoxia which is often due to a large fenestration, collateral vessels or high PVR;
  - h) Fontan circuit failure.
- General management strategies are very similar to those adopted following BCPS and include:
  - a) managing the complications of cardiopulmonary bypass;
  - b) appropriate pacing to maintain AV synchrony;
  - c) nursing the child with the head elevated;
  - d) appropriate anticoagulation (heparin, aspirin or warfarin);
  - e) ensuring adequate preload;
  - f) using vasopressors, such as noradrenaline, to manage the inflammatory response and promote the systemic venous return to the pulmonary arteries;
  - g) consideration of an inodilator, such as milrinone, if ventricular impairment, low cardiac output or AV valve regurgitation are present;

- h) using minimal ventilation pressures (without causing atelectasis) — with the lowest peak inspiratory pressure, PEEP and shortest inspiratory times as possible; spontaneous breathing modes on the ventilator as soon as possible; minimising intrathoracic pressure to promote SVC and IVC blood flow to the PA;
- i) aiming to extubate early but only when clinically ready. Whilst early extubation can promote the passive, lung-bound cavopulmonary blood flow during inspiration, other benefits of positive pressure ventilation, such as support of ventricular function, will be lost;
- j) removing jugular central venous lines as soon as possible to reduce the risk of thrombosis within the shunt;
- k) delaying chest drain removal until it is evident that they are no longer draining.
- Longer-term complications of the Fontan circuit may require PICU care, particularly in the failing Fontan circuit, including:
  - a) systemic venous hypertension;
  - b) pleural effusions;
  - c) ascites;
  - d) protein-losing enteropathy;
  - e) thromboembolic events;
  - f) ventricular failure.

#### 26 **What are principles of management of <sup>a</sup> cardiac arrest in the post-cardiotomy neonatal or paediatric patient?**

- Standard advanced paediatric life support should be initiated on any cardiac arrest. This includes early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and rapid defibrillation, if appropriate.
- Consideration of the reversible causes of the arrest, referred to as the '4Hs and 4Ts' must be undertaken quickly (Table 4).
- During advanced life support and review of each of the above causes, consideration should be given to some specific interventions in the post-cardiotomy patient, including:
  - a) activation of the extracorporeal life support team to cannulate the child for ECMO;
  - b) early opening of the chest, followed by internal cardiac compressions;
  - c) introduction of inhaled nitric oxide into the ventilation circuit;

BT shunt = Blalock-Taussig shunt; PICU = paediatric intensive care unit; ECMO = extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; CVP = central venous pressure; CO2 = carbon dioxide; VF = ventricular fibrillation; VT = ventricular tachycardia.**

T Tamponade (cardiac)

This is a common cause of post-cardiotomy cardiac arrest. Typical features of hypotension, raised CVP, tachycardia and echocardiographic evidence prior to the arrest can suggest this. In neonates/smaller children, however, tamponade can occur in the absence of pericardial fluid and occurs due to the myocardial swelling against the posterior aspect of the sternum. This should be assumed in all post-cardiotomy cardiac arrests. Tamponade is not an echo diagnosis and emergency chest re-opening may be necessary even in the absence of echo findings.

T Thromboembolic

Consideration should be given to thromboembolic events in children with known coagulation disorders, or those who have had shunt insertion, placing them at risk of thrombosis. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis should be considered to prevent this.

T Toxins

This is unlikely to occur as the cause of the cardiac arrest; however, it is essential to ensure any infusions or drugs that have been given were administered correctly.

!!! Pulmonary hypertension

This is more common in neonates/smaller infants or those with previous left-to-right shunts. It can be triggered by rising CO2, acidosis, pain/agitation or waking up. Without a residual shunt the CVP will increase, followed by hypotension and signs of low cardiac output. Without intervention, cardiac arrest can quickly occur. See question 29.

**Table 4** *continued***. Potentially reversible causes of cardiac arrest postcardiotomy. BT shunt = Blalock-Taussig shunt; PICU = paediatric intensive care unit; ECMO = extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; CVP = central venous pressure; CO2 = carbon dioxide; VF = ventricular fibrillation; VT = ventricular tachycardia.**

!!! Arrhythmias Any arrhythmia can occur post-cardiotomy. The development of profound sinus bradycardia or heart block can cause a low cardiac output state. Tachyarrhythmia can lead to loss of cardiac output. Ventricular arrhythmias (e.g. VF/VT) should raise the question about coronary artery pathology. Junctional ectopic tachycardia can cause all degrees of cardiovascular compromise and may require ECMO whilst it resolves. See question 14.

- d) attempting to pace any bradycardia using the epicardial pacing wires attached;
- e) fixing any cardiac lesions, such as a bolus of heparin in cases of a blocked shunt;
- f) low threshold for early diagnostic interventions, including a computed tomography scan or cardiac catheterisation, once stability has been obtained.

#### 27 **What are the outcomes for children admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit following congenital heart disease surgery?**

- Survival outcomes for children undergoing congenital heart surgery are generally very good.
- Outcomes relate to the severity of the lesion, development of postoperative acute kidney injury with the need for renal replacement therapy, the association of other comorbidities and the age of the child.
- Recent data published in the National Congenital Heart Disease Audit (NCHDA) by the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (NICOR) from the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland shows a 30-day aggregate postoperative survival of approximately 98%. This does not take into account deaths after 30 days, and some of the more complex lesions, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, are known to have an inter-stage mortality.

The 'Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery' (RACHS-1) was created to help identify risk and understand differences in mortality amongst children undergoing congenital cardiac surgery. Whilst this has been modified and adapted by more recent stratification methods, it remains a simple, helpful tool to understand risk and for research purposes (Table 5).

Multidisciplinary team care at the different stages of the patient pathway is paramount to optimise outcomes:

Ebstein's anomaly repair <30 days

Norwood operation

a) pre-operative care - identify the diagnosis and commence medical management, nutritional support, management of noncardiac issues and psychological support;

- b) peri- and intra-operative care provide a good anaesthetic assessment and management, full surgical planning and appropriate techniques, and expert cardiopulmonary bypass management;
- c) immediate postoperative care provide excellent PICU care, with early recognition and management of complications;
- d) longer-term postoperative care ongoing cardiology management and follow-up, psychological support, neurodevelopmental care and nutritional support.
- Many studies have looked at the longer-term outcomes for children with congenital heart disease and they have found a spectrum of morbidity related to neurodevelopment, including:
  - a) impaired communication, such as autism;
  - b) cognitive impairment;
  - c) behavioural difficulties;
  - d) motor developmental delay;
  - e) seizure disorders.
- There are also functional outcomes relating to any underlying cardiac lesions and ventricular function, such as reduced exercise tolerance.

#### 28 **What are the effects of positive pressure ventilation on the cardiovascular system?**

- The use of ventilators on the PICU changes the respiration from a negative pressure-based mechanism (spontaneous breathing) to a positive pressure mechanism (mechanical ventilation).
- Since the heart, lungs and vascular system are all interdependent, this change in physiology impacts more than just the lungs.
- When treating a right-sided cardiac lesion, some principles of management include:
  - a) limiting the intrathoracic pressure;
  - b) lowering the peak and mean airway pressures, with lower PEEP;
  - c) shortening the inspiratory times;
  - d) optimising the tidal volumes, aiming to ventilate to the functional residual capacity;
  - e) avoiding hypoxia and respiratory acidosis (to control PVR).

- When treating a left-sided cardiac lesion, some principles of management include using:
  - a) ventilation to optimise afterload reduction via a reduction in transmural pressures;
  - b) higher PEEP;
  - c) positive pressure to reduce venous return and volume loading.
- Positive pressure ventilation has significant effects on the cardiovascular system (Table 6). In parallel, extubation, and return to negative pressure ventilation, has the opposite effect and is a highrisk period for all children with congenital cardiac disease, as it essentially increases the systemic afterload and increases the volume loading of the pulmonary ventricle. This may or may not be beneficial.

#### 29 **What are the principles of management of <sup>a</sup> child with a pulmonary hypertensive crisis?**

• Pulmonary hypertension can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary (such as due to congenital cardiac disease or the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass).

- Secondary pulmonary hypertension is a relatively common problem on the PICU, particularly in the postoperative phases in children who have previously had an unobstructed large left-to-right shunt prior to surgery or neonatal patients who have undergone bypass surgery.
- The pathophysiology of an acute pulmonary hypertensive crisis is associated with an acute rise in the PA pressure that leads to clinical deterioration. It is important to break this cycle to prevent cardiac arrest (Figure 9).

![](_page_49_Figure_4.jpeg)

**Figure 9. Pathophysiology of a pulmonary hypertensive crisis.**

- Children with an acute pulmonary hypertensive crisis can be categorised into two groups:
  - a) with an intracardiac shunt where increases in PA pressure causes the RV pressure to rise, producing a right-to-left shunt.

- This causes significant systemic desaturation, whilst cardiac output is maintained:
- b) without an intracardiac shunt - where increases in PA pressure causes the preload to the left ventricle to reduce, while the pressure-overloaded RV distends, altering the ventricular interdependence.
- Features common to both groups include a sharp rise in central venous pressure, reflecting the elevation of the RVEDP and tricuspid regurgitation. Compensatory tachycardia is a feature of the early stage of the crisis, but it is often followed by a bradycardia, associated with the rapid progression of ventricular failure. This leads to a fall in cardiac output and even cardiac arrest.
- The management of an acute pulmonary hypertensive crisis is aimed at quickly and effectively reducing pulmonary vascular resistance, whilst simultaneously increasing the systemic vascular resistance ensuring an adequate systemic cardiac output. hyperventilation is among the first manoeuvres adopted in these cases to guickly establish hypocapnia and increase oxygenation (Table 7).

#### Table 7. Management strategies for an acute pulmonary hypertensive crisis.

#### Other considerations Reduce pulmonary Increase systemic vascular resistance vascular resistance Fluid bolus Reduce PaCO<sub>2</sub> Vasopressin/ (increase minute volume) (increase RV noradrenaline Maximise FiO<sub>2</sub> 1.0 preload) Inotropes ECMO Inhaled nitric oxide (e.g. adrenaline) Milrinone Sedate and muscle relax Avoid/correct acidosis Magnesium replacement

Although children on the PICU with pulmonary hypertension may be commenced on oral pulmonary vasodilators, such as sildenafil, to enable weaning from inhaled nitric oxide and mechanical ventilation, these are seldom helpful in the acute setting.

- 30 **What is the role of the congenital cardiac surgeon in the care of the non-cardiac surgical patient on the paediatric intensive care unit?**
- The congenital cardiac surgeon may be asked to assist with:
  - a) cannulation and ongoing management of extracorporeal life support;
  - b) thoracic trauma in children;
  - c) drainage of complex pericardial or pleural effusions;
  - d) pleurectomy in a pleural effusion otherwise difficult to manage;
  - e) multidisciplinary team discussions on all relevant decisionmaking;
  - f) back-up support for interventional cardiology.

#### 31 **What is the role of an interventional paediatric cardiologist in the paediatric intensive care unit?**

- The interventional paediatric cardiologist offers a great deal to the PICU, with common interventions including:
  - a) participating in multidisciplinary team discussions on all relevant decision-making;
  - b) balloon atrial septostomy in patients with:
    - i) transposition of the great arteries with inadequate mixing;
    - ii) restrictive atrial septum in single-ventricle anatomy;
  - c) pericardiocentesis and drain insertion;
  - d) balloon dilatation procedures, such as:
    - i) valvuloplasty in critical aortic or pulmonary stenosis;
    - ii) pulmonary vein stenosis;
  - e) stent insertion into the:
    - i) right ventricular outflow tract;
    - ii) PDA;
  - f) closure of lesions:
    - i) coiling of major aortopulmonary collaterals (MAPCAs);
    - ii) device closure of an ASD or VSD;
  - g) diagnostic studies, such as:
    - i) Qp:Qs measurement;
    - ii) identification of residual lesions;
    - iii) assessment of pulmonary hypertension;
  - h) electrophysiology catheterisation, such as:
    - i) temporary transvenous pacing wire insertion;
    - ii) diagnostic studies;
    - iii) arrhythmia ablation;
    - iv) implantation of a permanent defibrillator or pacemaker.

- These procedures may be carried out at the patient's bedside or in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory.
- 32 **What are the potential complications experienced by long-term patients on the paediatric intensive care unit?**
- Long-term patients can experience a number of comorbidities as a consequence of a prolonged stay on the PICU. Consideration of these factors needs to be a part of their ongoing care plan (Figure 10).

![](_page_52_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Figure 10. Potential complications of a prolonged stay on the paediatric intensive care unit.**

#### 33 **Describe the principles of monitoring the neurological status of children on the paediatric intensive care unit**

- Although the best method to assess a child's neurological status is to allow them to rouse from sedation, this is not always possible or appropriate in some situations.
- All children on the PICU receive standard neurological monitoring, including:
  - a) age-specific regular neurological observations, such as Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and pupillary responses;
  - b) sedation, COMFORT-B and pain scores;
  - c) sedation breaks to assess neurology;
  - d) clinical examination of the neurological system.

#### • Additional tools for use at the beside include:

- a) bispectral index (BIS) monitor to assess the depth of anaesthesia;
- b) cerebral function-analysing monitor (CFAM) which records an amplitude integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG);
- c) formal electroencephalography (EEG) which can be carried out at the bedside but requires specialist neurophysiology interpretation;
- d) cranial ultrasound imaging which is useful in infants with an open fontanelle. It allows rapid detection of significant intraventricular haemorrhage and can suggest severe ischaemia, but can often miss smaller changes.

#### • Other imaging modalities include:

- a) computed tomography (CT) which is useful in an emergency situation, as it is quick to perform and gives good rapid information about bleeding and infarction. It may, however, miss some subtle pathologies and requires radiation to a child's brain;
- b) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which provides much more detailed information about brain matter, particularly hypoxic brain injury and does not involve radiation. It does, however, take a lot longer to perform, with less access to the patient during the scan, so is only suitable for haemodynamically stable patients. In addition, it cannot be used in those with contraindications, such as with a certain type of pacemaker áå ëáíì.

### 34 **What are the principles of point-of-care ultrasound?**

- Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) refers to a portable bedside ultrasound performed by the intensivist to scan relevant body systems.
- It differs from radiology ultrasonography or cardiology echocardiography in that it is designed to answer a pre-defined question with a yes or no answer, and it is not intended to provide detailed anatomical and physiological assessments.
- The advantages of POCUS over traditional imaging include being immediately available to the attending clinician at the patient's bedside, allowing real-time pathological changes to be seen with no lag time. In addition, it can be repeated frequently to monitor progression or assess the impact of an intervention, and improves the safety and accuracy of certain interventional procedures.
- Many body systems can be scanned using the POCUS binary questions, including:
  - a) cardiac POCUS:
    - i) is the ventricle contracting well?
    - ii) is the ventricle empty or full?
    - iii) is there a pericardial effusion?
  - b) respiratory POCUS:
    - i) is there pulmonary oedema?
    - ii) is there a pleural effusion?
    - iii) is there a pneumothorax?
    - iv) is there a pleural effusion?
    - v) is there consolidation?
  - c) abdominal POCUS:
    - i) is there ascites?
- In the cardiac population, a particularly useful role of respiratory POCUS is the assessment of extravascular lung water content and pulmonary oedema, either prior to extubation or on presentation.
- In patients with pulmonary oedema, extensive B-lines with a normal pleural line can be seen. These B-lines resolve in real time with resolution of the oedema, unlike the chest X-ray changes which can lag behind the clinical picture (Figure 11).

**Figure 11. Lung point-of-care ultrasound taken from the anterior chest wall demonstrating: A) normal lung and B) pulmonary oedema.**

#### 35 **Describe the principles of nutrition for cardiac patients on the paediatric intensive care unit**

- The nutritional status of the child plays an integral part in the metabolic response to injury and critical illness.
- Malnutrition has been associated with increased mortality and morbidity, including longer PICU stay. Poor nutrition in a cardiac child can prevent growth and make further surgery more difficult. Nutrition should be optimised pre-operatively, if possible.
- Regular reviews by dieticians are vital to ensure metabolic demands are being met and appropriate monitoring is taking place. Overfeeding can also cause complications, which is why daily energy requirements should be calculated accurately (Table 8).

#### **Table 8. Complications of malnutrition and overfeeding.**

#### **bÑÑÉÅíë çÑ éççê åìíêáíáçå**

#### • Impaired immunity

- Increased risk of infection
- Impaired wound healing
- Constipation/ileus
- Specific vitamin/mineral deficiency
- Hypoproteinaemia and oedema

#### **bÑÑÉÅíë çÑ çîÉêÑÉÉÇáåÖ**

- Fluid overload and oedema
- Increased risk of infection
- Diarrhoea
- Increased gastric losses/poor absorption
- Obesity
- Establishing sufficient nutritional support and delivering estimated energy requirements can be challenging due to fluid restrictions, feed interruptions (such as for procedures), gastric intolerances (such as ileus) and gastrointestinal pathology (such as ischaemic colitis).
- Factors affecting nutrition on the PICU include:
  - a) increased metabolic requirements, such as pyrexia, sepsis;
  - b) poor intake, such as fluid restriction;
  - c) increased losses, such as poor absorption, sweating;
  - d) increased exertion, such as respiratory effort.
- Early enteral feeding is preferable despite the presence of critical illness to maintain gut integrity and reduce the risk of ileus.

- Few contraindications for enteral feeding exist and include necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), ischaemic colitis, gastrointestinal bleeding or mechanical bowel obstruction.
- Multiple inotropic support is not an absolute contraindication but nutrition should be carefully reviewed in the context of the whole clinical picture.
- Certain children are considered high risk for abdominal pathology or feeding complications and should be fed cautiously. Broadly, these are children who have or have had compromised systemic blood flow and present concerns regarding splanchnic hypoperfusion. These children are at significantly higher risk of developing ischaemic colitis and include:
  - a) cardiac lesions with low systemic output, such as HLHS, critical aortic stenosis, interrupted aortic arch and coarctation of the aorta;
  - b) prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp times, particularly in small infants;
  - c) children on ECMO;
  - d) previous abdominal pathology;
  - e) long-term poor nutrition, where there is a risk of refeeding syndrome.
- High-risk children can be fed cautiously after a period of stability. When this is not feasible, parenteral nutrition should be considered if enteral nutrition has been suspended for 7 days. Early parenteral nutrition has been associated with poorer outcomes. Many PICUs have high-risk feeding protocols.
- There needs to be a low threshold for stopping feeds, performing an abdominal X-ray or ultrasound, and obtaining a general surgical review for early detection of ischaemic colitis in these children.
- Parenteral nutrition, although vital for some patients, is not without disadvantages, and includes:
  - a) venous thrombosis and difficulties obtaining long-term IV access;
  - b) line sepsis;
  - c) metabolic abnormalities or electrolyte imbalances;
  - d) regular blood sampling, including renal and liver function, lipids, amino acids and triglycerides;
  - e) imbalance of trace elements;
  - f) financial implications.

#### 36 **What considerations must be given to the child who is dying?**

- The end-of-life care for a child and their family on the PICU is a difficult time for all involved.
- Unexpected death is a very different scenario compared to the situation where the perceived best interest of the child rests with redirection of care towards symptom management and an end-of-life care pathway.
- Prior to discussing the topic with the family, it is important to obtain agreement of the multidisciplinary team. The consensus decision needs to be reached that treatment aimed at continuing life is no longer in the best interest of the child.
- These can be extremely difficult and complex discussions and decisions to be made, and they may involve second opinions, ethical and legal reviews, and escalation to senior hospital management.
- It is important for the family to understand the clinical situation. Time is important and this is not a topic that can be rushed.
- Some important considerations include:
  - a) involvement of the palliative care services;
  - b) organ donation, when clinically indicated;
  - c) memory boxes, such as handprints, footprints and photographs, to support parents through the process;
  - d) supporting religious beliefs and requirements are paramount;
  - e) careful consideration for a post-mortem;
  - f) recording of all phases of this process, as well as routine clinical practice and a record of communication are vital, as legal investigations may arise;
  - g) performing any relevant investigations to give a diagnosis (e.g. skin and muscle biopsies).
