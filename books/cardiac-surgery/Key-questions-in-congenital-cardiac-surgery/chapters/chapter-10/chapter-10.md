# Cardiopulmonary bypass

**Sarah Goring, Lale Begum, Sian Jaggar**

# 1 **What are the aims of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)?**

- Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is a complex circulation and respiratory device that facilitates open heart surgery by:
  - a) completely replacing the function of the heart and lungs;
  - b) providing a clear operating field for the surgeon;
  - c) maintaining oxygen (O2) delivery to, and carbon dioxide (CO2) removal from, the patient's tissues;
  - d) reducing the workload of the heart by emptying, thus minimising myocardial oxygen demand;
  - e) providing additional myocardial and end-organ protection through:
    - i) cardioplegia solution to stop myocardial cellular metabolism;
    - ii) reducing the patient's temperature to decrease cellular oxygen demand.

# 2 **What are the critical components of <sup>a</sup> cardiopulmonary bypass circuit (Figure 1)?**

- Venous line (blue) which drains blood from the systemic venous circulation, usually the superior and inferior vena cavae (SVC and IVC), or less commonly in congenital surgery, the right atrium (RA) or hepatic veins.
- Reservoir which is usually a hard-shell plastic container with filters (to remove debris) and volume markings (to visualise changes in venous return).
- Pump which can be either a roller or centrifugal pump.
- Oxygenator which contains thousands of microporous fibres inside a plastic housing. Air and oxygen are circulated within the fibres, whilst blood flows around them. Gas exchange occurs across micropores, replacing the function of the lungs.

**Figure 1. Components of the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit, including the venous return component of the circuit (blue), arterial component (red) and suction/venting system (green).**

- Heat exchanger which is incorporated into the oxygenator housing. Water is pumped through the exchanger and allows precise thermoregulation of the circulating blood.
- Arterial line (red) which returns blood to the arterial circulation (usually the aorta) providing antegrade flow. A variety of other externally or internally accessible sites may be used, including the subclavian artery, brachiocephalic artery and femoral artery (which results in retrograde flow). This is particularly common in redo surgery, which occurs more frequently in congenital procedures.
- Cardiotomy suction (green) which is controlled by roller pumps to remove blood from the operative field and return it to the reservoir, thereby keeping the surgical field clear.

# 3 **What are the cardiopulmonary bypass components made of?**

- The CPB circuit is single use and made of a variety of synthetic polymers, with most tubing sets manufactured from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and plasticisers to increase flexibility.
- Tubing contained in the raceway of the roller pumps and suckers are usually made of silicone, which produces less haemolysis (in comparison to PVC) when blood is repeatedly compressed by rollers.
- Oxygenator fibres are made of polypropylene, stretched and heated to form micropores.
- The oxygenator accounts for the largest surface area within the CPB circuit and is often the only component of the circuit to be coated with biocompatible substances, such as para-methoxy-Nethylamphetamine (PMEA) or heparin.
- The rest of the circuit is less commonly coated, due to cost, though evidence suggests fully coated circuits cause less inflammatory response.

# 4 **Describe the important safety features incorporated into a cardiopulmonary bypass circuit**

- Intra-circuit air detectors which minimise one of the main risks of CPB, namely air entrapment within the circuit and its embolisation into the patient, and include the following:
  - a) level detector attached to a reservoir which stops the arterial pump if venous return is reduced to the point of emptying the reservoir. This would lead to gross air in the circuit and lead to air bubbles in the system. It is most likely to occur with surgical manipulation (inadvertently blocking venous cannulae) or cannula displacement;
  - b) ultrasonic bubble alarm which is attached to the arterial line after the oxygenator. This can stop the pump if bubbles are detected; for example, if negative pressure in the circuit draws gas across the oxygenator or cavitates air;
  - c) one-way valves which are often incorporated into suckers on the neonatal and paediatric CPB circuits, and can prevent air being blown into the patient if suckers are wrongly placed into the pump raceway or the pump is operated in the wrong direction.
- Arterial line pressure monitors which alarm if the cannulae are obstructed, thereby reducing the risk of circuit rupture. Inappropriate positioning of the arterial lines may cause aortic dissection or poor perfusion of the individual aortic branches. Cannulae are more easily

- displaced in neonatal and paediatric patients, due to their small size and the size of the native vessels.
- Filters which are incorporated in the reservoir and oxygenator, prevent gaseous or particulate microemboli reaching the patient.
- In-line monitors which allow constant monitoring of the metabolic status of the patient, including haematocrit, potassium, lactate and O2 levels.
- Small-volume circuits which reduce the amount of foreign material to which blood is exposed, thus reducing the associated inflammatory response. They also reduce the risks of haemodilution by reducing the volume of (mainly) clear prime fluid.
- Hand crank which is available on every CPB machine, for use in the event of electrical failure.
- In addition, vigilance of the perfusionist is necessary to act upon safety features built into the circuit.

# 5 **What are the different types of cardiopulmonary bypass pumps?**

- In adults with acquired or congenital conditions, either a roller or centrifugal pump is routinely used.
- In neonatal and infant patients, roller pumps are more common.
- Roller pumps (Figure 2) allow the desired flow to be set regardless of the resistance to flow provided by the patient (afterload). The sole constraints to this are:
  - a) adequate venous return;
  - b) excessive arterial line pressure.
- With prolonged use, roller pumps may be associated with spallation (breakdown of tubing) and particulate embolisation.
- Centrifugal pumps (Figure 3) are non-occlusive and are more commonly used in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuits and ventricular assist devices (VADs).
- In centrifugal pumps, a vortex is generated by spinning magnets, creating a pressure gradient between the inlet (A) and outlet (B) of the pump. The spinning action sucks venous blood in, imparts kinetic energy to it, and expels it to the patient. It is important to note that:
  - a) flow generated is entirely dependent on preload and afterload;
  - b) backflow may occur, particularly at low flows;
  - c) in children with a small cardiac output and high afterload, a disproportionately large drop in flow may occur.

### 6 **What are the typical priming constituents for cardiopulmonary bypass circuits in congenital heart surgery?**

- Crystalloid prime (such as Hartmann's solution, Plasma-Lyte™) which mimics physiological conditions and maintains physiological tonicity, thus minimising red cell lysis and unwanted fluid shifts.
- Packed red blood cells which are often added to the prime volume in neonates and infants because even minimised CPB volumes risk excessive haemodilution. Although haematocrit (Hct) levels >24% on CPB are associated with reduced lactate and better psychomotor development scores in infants, increases in Hct above this level have not been shown to produce better outcomes. In cyanotic patients, who may have a much higher Hct, reducing this may not be tolerated if a mixed circulation remains postoperatively.
- Colloids (such as gelatins, hetastarch or albumin) which may be added to increase the osmotic pressure of the prime, thereby theoretically reducing oedema, although this has not been shown to affect outcomes in adult or paediatric patients.
- Mannitol which may be added to produce an osmotic diuretic effect, stabilise cell membranes, scavenge oxygen free radicals and reduce cerebral oedema. Alterations in outcome, however, are yet to be consistently demonstrated.
- Sodium bicarbonate or tromethamine (THAM) may be added to the prime to correct a base deficit.
- Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) which is added to prime in some paediatric and neonatal centres, and is thought to improve fibrinogen levels post-CPB. Evidence of clinical benefit is inconclusive.
- Aprotinin which is frequently added to prime for redo surgery, due to increased bleeding risk. Its use has varied over time and with some evidence available on advantages and disadvantages.

# 7 **What parameters are monitored on cardiopulmonary bypass during congenital heart disease surgery?**

- Monitoring during CPB assesses the three main domains involved, namely the CPB circuit, fluid within the circuit and the patient.
- Within the CPB circuit, a number of parameters are monitored, including the:
  - a) reservoir volume to ensure the pump output matches the return;
  - b) venous return to ensure there is no reduction, such as following snaring of the venous cannulae or associated with

- kinking of the venous lines, which may cause cerebral hypoperfusion due to increased central venous (CVP) and intracranial (ICP) pressures;
- c) arterial flow to ensure adequate cardiac output is delivered;
- d) line pressures (such as arterial and cardioplegia) to avoid circuit rupture if the lines become kinked or are otherwise obstructed. It also gives an idea of the shear forces exerted on blood, and pressure being applied to, for example, the coronary sinus during retrograde cardioplegia delivery. High pressures (300-350mmHg) cause the pump to stop. Monitoring cardioplegic line pressure is critical in avoiding hypertensive flow into the neonatal myocardium.
- As regards fluid within the bypass circuit, many values are continuously monitored in-line, including:
  - a) total gas flow and fractional oxygen delivery through the oxygenator — which are manipulated to maintain O2 and CO2 levels within physiological values;
  - b) arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) which is usually maintained between 20-30kPa. Although O2 demand is higher in children, hyperoxic bypass has been associated with increased myocardial injury and systemic stress in cyanotic patients;
  - c) venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) which is an important indicator of systemic perfusion. Its interpretation, however, is complicated in patients with systemic-pulmonary collateral vessels, when high venous saturation may occur despite organ hypoperfusion. During deep hypothermic CPB, a higher proportion of O2 delivery is provided by O2 dissolved in plasma, and less from that carried by haemoglobin (due to the Bohr effect and reduced dissociation with decreasing temperature);
  - d) arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO2) which allows appropriate addition of CO2 during paediatric CPB, where excessively efficient removal can result in a respiratory alkalosis;
  - e) haematocrit (Hct) which allows efficient delivery of oxygen. Optimum levels, however, remain somewhat controversial. At low temperatures, some haemodilution may improve the microcirculation by reducing viscosity and may be better tolerated due to the increased O2 content of plasma. A higher Hct strategy during low-flow hypothermic CPB in infants, however, has been associated with better short- (lower lactate

- and higher cardiac index postoperatively) and long-term (higher psychomotor development index scores) outcomes. Optimisation of Hct above 40 in neonates with single-ventricle circulation has been associated with better outcomes, especially following stage I procedures;
- f) pH, potassium and lactate which are calibrated from blood gases. Acidosis and increased lactate suggest inadequate perfusion, whilst potassium may rise during CPB following cardioplegia delivery;
- g) blood glucose which tends to rise during CPB as part of an inflammatory response.
- Patient parameters that are monitored include the:
  - a) arterial pressure which can be adjusted mechanically by changing pump flow or pharmacologically (such as with metaraminol, phenylephrine or glyceryl trinitrate) to increase or decrease the systemic vascular resistance (SVR), to ensure perfusion of tissues on CPB;
  - b) right atrial pressure (RAP) which should be zero on CPB if venous drainage is optimal, thereby avoiding raised ICP, and helps to guide filling when weaning from CPB;
  - c) core and peripheral temperature to ensure even cooling and warming, and avoid large temperature gradients between the heat exchanger and blood. Inadequate cooling may be associated with inadequate protection, whereas over-warming is linked to neurological damage;
  - d) cerebral oxygenation by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as an indication of cerebral perfusion, particularly in paediatric patients.

### 8 **What are the major differences in cardiopulmonary bypass between patients with congenital and acquired cardiac disease?**

- Patients with congenital heart disease may range from preterm neonates to adult. Although the adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) population is increasing, it remains much smaller than the population with acquired disease.
- Patients require an appropriate sized circuit, as even with small circuits for infants, the extent of haemodilution is greater than that for adults.

- Many congenital conditions require multiple staged or repeat surgical procedures over a lifetime and the risk of catastrophic injury to mediastinal structures when opening the sternum increases with the number of procedures. In these cases, CPB may be initiated via femoral cannulation whilst the sternum is opened, although in children, femoral cannulae size may be inadequate to provide the required flow.
- Abnormal systemic-pulmonary collateral connections are common in congenital patients. These may shunt blood away from the systemic circulation making it difficult to assess the efficacy of tissue O2 delivery. In addition, they produce a significant increase in blood in the operative field, which must be managed with appropriate venting.
- Complicated anatomy requiring extensive open-heart access, and long CPB and cross-clamp durations, are associated with higher morbidity.
- The need for deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) is greater in patients with congenital heart disease. This is associated with worse outcomes.

# 9 **Describe the anticoagulant regimens used for cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with congenital heart disease**

- Heparin is added to the CPB prime (in addition to an intravenous bolus) to avoid clotting of blood on contact with the foreign surfaces of the CPB circuit.
- A target activated clotting time (ACT) of seconds is maintained throughout CPB, with additional heparin as needed.
- As neonates and infants have more variable clotting factors and immature drug metabolism, the efficacy and duration of effect are less predictable.
- Congenital heart disease patients have repeated exposure to heparin from recurrent procedures and although heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) has been reported as rare, it may well be under-recognised in these patients.

# 10 **Describe the principles of arterial cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass in congenital cardiac surgery**

• Although children have small vessels, the cannulae must be large enough to provide adequate flow without excessive pressure or

- shear force, whilst being small enough to avoid completely obstructing the vessel.
- As resternotomy cases may be associated with a risk of direct trauma to the heart and great vessels, cannulae may be placed in alternate sites initially, such as the femoral or subclavian artery to facilitate CPB prior to sternotomy.
- Congenital cardiac anatomy shows greater inter-patient variability and arterial cannulation needs to reflect this, such as for the:
  - a) arterial switch procedure where distal placement is necessary to avoid flow being directed away from the arterial branches (Figure 4);

**Figure 4. Cardiopulmonary bypass cannulation for a patient with transposition of the great arteries and a ventricular septal defect, including: A) the aortic cannulation placed in the aortic arch, with inclination of the cannula at insertion to avoid damage to the posterior wall; and B) bicaval venous cannulation to allow right atrial access to the ventricular septal defect.

- b) stage I repair for hypoplastic left heart syndrome where the cannula is placed in the pulmonary artery, as the aorta is small or absent;
- c) complex aortic arch reconstructions where two cannulae may be required to perfuse the upper and lower body, and account for anatomical anomalies of the epi-aortic branches (Figure 5).

The second arm of the arterial line has been used to cannulate the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) to perfuse the descending aorta and the left subclavian artery. A single venous line is used to drain the right atrium (RA).** *Image courtesy of Mr. Antonio Ravaglioli, University Hospital Southampton, UK.*

#### 11 **Describe the principles of venous cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass in congenital cardiac surgery**

- Blood drains by gravity from the patient to the reservoir, secondary to a siphon effect.
- Separate cannulae in the IVC and SVC provide optimum drainage and an empty heart for surgical access.
- Children provide particular challenges, with drainage more likely to be compromised as vessels, cannulae and blood volumes are smaller.
- In addition, the small tubing used to reduce the prime volume also reduces the gravity siphon drainage and therefore flow. This may require augmentation by controlled vacuum-assisted suction.
- In resternotomy cases, CPB may need to be initiated via the femoral route, which may not provide adequate venous return, thereby also requiring vacuum-assisted drainage.
- Congenital patients may have unusual venous anatomy, such as left or bilateral SVCs, azygos/hemiazygos continuation of the IVC, necessitating more than two venous cannulae.

# 12 **Describe the principles of venting the heart during cardiopulmonary bypass**

- One or more of the suckers on the CPB circuit may be used as a cardiac vent to:
  - a) clear the operative field;
  - b) prevent warming the heart which increases myocardial oxygen consumption;
  - c) avoid distending the arrested heart which increases ventricular wall tension, increases myocardial metabolic rate and reduces subendocardial perfusion, thereby leaving the myocardium more vulnerable to ischaemic damage;
  - d) de-air the heart at the completion of the procedure.
- Venting is required more frequently than in acquired disease due to more variable venous anatomy, with the increased likelihood that the heart may not be fully emptied. Blood may return to the heart from the:
  - a) Thebesian and bronchial veins which occur in a normal circulation;

- b) pathophysiological systemic-pulmonary shunts such as collateral vessels, patent ductus arteriosus;
- c) abnormal anatomy such as a persistent left SVC;
- d) surgically implanted shunts such as Blalock-Taussig shunt or Potts shunt;
- e) coronary sinus following administration of cardioplegia.
- Vents may be sited in the:
  - a) left ventricle antegrade via the right superior pulmonary vein and left atrium, into the ventricle, or retrograde via the aortic valve if the aorta is opened;
  - b) right ventricle antegrade.

# 13 **Describe how the required flow rate (cardiac output) is calculated in adult and paediatric patients**

• Flow rate in litres per minute (LPM) can be calculated as body surface area (BSA) multiplied by the desired cardiac index (CI):

Flow (LPM) = BSA 
$$x$$
 CI

• Although several calculations are available for BSA utilising height (H) and weight (W), the most commonly used is the DuBois formula:

$$BSA = \sqrt{\frac{\text{Height (cm) x Weight (kg)}}{3600}}$$

• Adults usually require a cardiac index of 2.4, whereas in paediatrics, a CI of 2.6-2.8 is used due to their higher metabolic rate.

# 14 **Describe the principles of gas exchange in the cardiopulmonary bypass circuits**

- Gases diffuse in and out of blood across the micropores in the oxygenator fibres in accordance with their concentration gradients (Figure 6).
- Microporous fibres are orientated in such a way that gas flow is perpendicular (or counter-current) to blood flow, which increases the efficiency of gas transfer.

![](_page_13_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 6. Membrane oxygenator with a hydrophobic membrane that presents a large surface area for gas exchange.**

- Fick's law of diffusion states that the amount of gas that diffuses increases as concentration gradients increase. Thus, to increase:
  - a) O2 transfer into blood the concentration of O2 in the fibres is increased via a blender;
  - b) CO2 removal from blood the rate of gas flow ('sweep') through the fibres is increased.

#### 15 **What are the principles of myocardial protection in patients undergoing surgery for congenital cardiac disease?**

- It is important to match O2 supply with demand of the myocardium to provide myocardial protection by ensuring:
  - a) adequate aortic root (driving) pressure;
  - b) minimal ventricular wall tension with an empty ventricle;
  - c) optimal Hct for carriage of O2 (high);
  - d) adequate flow (low viscosity) through small coronary vessels.
- Myocardial O2 demand can be reduced by means of:
  - a) temperature with a reduction associated with decreased metabolic rate;

b) pharmacologically — using cardioplegia to paralyse the myocardium in a flaccid state by increasing extracellular potassium concentration, thus blocking contraction and minimising cellular metabolism (Figure 7).

![](_page_14_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Figure 7. Antegrade crystalloid cardioplegia delivered under pressure, usually via a roller pump.**

- Cardioplegia is often mixed with arterial blood, containing O2 bound to haemoglobin, in older children and adults. The ratios vary but 4:1 (blood: cardioplegia) and 1:1 are the most common.
- In neonates and infants, crystalloid solutions avoid highly viscous blood failing to perfuse tiny coronary arteries at low temperatures.
- As any collateral circulation may cause washout of cardioplegia and compromise myocardial protection, the ECG must be monitored to check for signs of electrical activity at all times.
- Where there is ventricular hypertrophy, such as in patients with aortic stenosis, higher doses of cardioplegia may be required.

# 16 **When is cardiac arrest required for congenital cardiac surgery?**

• Arresting the heart with cardioplegia represents myocardial ischaemic time and therefore is only performed when:

- a) complex surgery is made easier on a still heart;
- b) surgery is needed on the myocardium of the very young;
- c) there is a risk of generating systemic air in patients with an intracardiac shunt, such as an ASD or VSD, access to leftsided structures is required, or when operating on patients with a single ventricle.
- The heart may not need to be arrested for:
  - a) surgery for an extracardiac shunt, such as a Blalock-Taussig shunt;
  - b) a right-sided abnormality, such as right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, provided intracardiac communications have been excluded.

# 17 **What are the principles of myocardial arrest in congenital cardiac surgery?**

- Cardioplegic arrest is the mechanism by which depolarisation (with subsequent prevention of repolarisation) or hyperpolarisation (preventing depolarisation) of the myocyte membrane is obtained in order to stop the release of calcium into the myocellular cytoplasm thus preventing contraction.
- High-concentration solutions (such as St. Thomas' solution) that induce membrane depolarisation by means of:
  - a) potassium chloride in high concentrations which alters the resting membrane potential (-90mV) and ionic gradients. The availability of rapid opening sodium channels is reduced thereby maintaining diastolic arrest. The side effects include vasoconstriction (with consequent variable myocardial delivery) and myocyte calcium loading (with increased repolarisation injury);
  - b) magnesium which inhibits myosin phosphorylase, protecting ATP reserves for post-ischaemic activity, and also reduces vasoconstriction and intracellular calcium loading.
- Depleted solutions (such as Bretschneider solution) that induce membrane hyperpolarisation by means of:
  - a) sodium depletion which induces diastolic cardiac arrest by eliminating the sodium differential across the cell membrane;
  - b) calcium depletion which prevents the contractile force from being generated;

- c) lidocaine which prevents depolarisation by entering the myocyte and blocking the sodium channels on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (local anaesthetic action). Associated vasodilatation promotes even distribution, thereby overcoming the coronary vasoconstriction action of potassium;
- d) adenosine which is believed to enhance recovery with small doses.

# • These solutions may be delivered:

- a) antegradely via the aortic root which requires a competent aortic valve;
- b) antegradely directly into coronary vessels where care must be taken to avoid causing trauma, especially with small coronary ostia (Figure 8);

![](_page_16_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Figure 8. Cardioplegia delivery in neonatal surgery: A) the cardioplegia cannula is inserted at an angle and caudally to the aorta to avoid perforation of the posterior wall and injury to the aortic valve; and B) following cross-clamp particular attention is given to avoid left ventricular distension and high aortic root pressure.** *Images courtesy of Mr. Antonio Ravaglioli, University Hospital Southampton, UK.*

c) retrogradely via the coronary sinus — which is uncommonly used due to possible malformations in patients with congenital heart disease.

# • Hypothermia:

- a) local hypothermia to the heart (such as using ice or a cooling jacket) — which reduces phosphate utilisation and decreases basal O2 consumption by approximately 50% for every 10°C drop;
- b) systemic cooling which decreases the heat delivered to the heart by blood returning via:
  - i) normal body drainage via the venae cavae (congenital patients may have an additional persistent left SVC);
  - ii) normal heart drainage via the coronary sinus and Thebesian veins;
  - iii) lungs via bronchial veins or anomalous pulmonary venous drainage;
  - iv) collateral vessels which may require active venting, if significant.
- Hypothermic fibrillation which provides a still field for surgery using systemic hypothermia (<24°C), at which temperature the heart fibrillates. If the systemic pressure is maintained >70mmHg, the myocardium remains perfused by blood passing antegradely through coronary vessels, potentially providing protection for an hour or more. It is useful (and commonly reported) in patients undergoing redo surgery where the risk of injury to the coronary arteries must be avoided. Problems, however, may occur with:
  - a) impaired coronary flow if the fibrillating myocardium compresses the coronary arteries;
  - b) incompetent aortic valve which may cause ventricular distension and coronary malperfusion.

# • Cross-clamp fibrillation — which involves:

- a) the heart electrically fibrillated, thus reducing the myocardial load, although it does induce global ischaemia and anoxic arrest;
- b) hypothermia (32-34°C), to reduce myocyte O2 demand and improve myocardial protection;
- c) decompression of the ventricles by intermittently using a crossclamp applied to the aorta, to avoid distension;
- d) limiting each fibrillating episode to minutes, with at least minutes of coronary reperfusion time required between clamping periods.

#### 18 **What are the important complications of cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with congenital cardiac disease?**

- In this patient population, the immature organs are more vulnerable to damage from CPB.
- The foetal lungs have a high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) that progressively drops during the first few weeks of life. The use of CPB in neonates, particularly those with a persistently high PVR, increases the incidence of lung injury and further dysfunction, from both inflammation (secondary to surface contact with the circuit) and ischaemia-reperfusion injury (following periods of inadequate flow).
- Neurological complications, including cerebrovascular accident, seizures, intracranial haemorrhage, and delayed choreoathetoid syndrome have been described.
- The use of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) increases the risk of complications, including major gastrointestinal complications, such as necrotising enterocolitis, perforation and bowel ischaemia.
- Patients with cyanosis or a hypertrophied myocardium are particularly challenging to protect and more sensitive to ischaemicreperfusion injury.
- Acute kidney injury is common in children following CPB.
- Chronic hypoxia and high blood viscosity in older, severely cyanotic patients may further impact organ function.
- Surgery in patients with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) is associated with a higher morbidity compared to patients with acquired cardiac disease, as these patients have:
  - a) an increased risk of catastrophic surgical bleeding during redo procedures;
  - b) pre-existing coagulopathy, often due to varying degrees of liver failure and exacerbated by dilution of clotting factors and platelets during CPB, thereby increasing the risk of haemorrhage;
  - c) concurrent renal abnormalities, caused by repeated CPB and chronic hypoxia, which may further increase the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and long-term damage.
- Pre-existing abnormalities make it difficult to attribute these solely to CPB, but hypoxia, temperature-related cerebral flow changes and embolism are potential mechanisms of damage.

#### 19 **What are the causes of myocardial injury during cardiopulmonary bypass for congenital cardiac surgery?**

- Cross-clamp ischaemic energy depletion which may (or may not) be reversible, depending on the length of ischaemia and efficacy of protection. Damage results from multiple issues, including ischaemia with resultant lactic acidosis, depletion of high-energy phosphates, altered intracellular calcium and direct trauma. Chronically, hypoxic hearts (a common feature in congenital heart disease) are less able to tolerate this. Late reperfusion activates an inflammatory response and apoptosis. An intermediate duration of ischaemia may result in myocardial stunning with delayed recovery.
- Following removal of the cross-clamp, reperfusion injury can result in:
  - a) intracellular calcium overload and leucocyte activation;
  - b) release of oxygen free radicals that activate complement, thereby causing endothelial injury and an increase in microvascular permeability, leading to oedema and cell death;
  - c) superoxide anion production due to increased oxygen availability, which damages endothelial barriers, and promotes neutrophil adhesion and activation;
  - d) inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide production, which exacerbates coronary artery vasospasm, pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure;
  - e) intra-coronary air embolism during reperfusion, which causes further ischaemia, especially in neonates.
- Left ventricular distension due to inadequate venting results in a reduced ability of the ventricle to eject against a high afterload.
- Failure of myocardial protection caused by long intervals between cardioplegia, particularly during complex cases, or impaired cardioplegia delivery due to:
  - a) aortic regurgitation;
  - b) anomalous coronary arteries arising from the pulmonary artery, which therefore do not receive cardioplegia;
  - c) absent coronary sinus which may be associated with a persistent left SVC;
  - d) anomalous connections of the coronary sinus with the left atrium or coronary arteries;
  - e) presence of coronary sinusoids fistulous connections between coronary arteries and the right ventricle, such as in patients with pulmonary atresia, thereby shunting of blood away from the myocardium.

• Surgical issues — regardless of the underlying congenital condition, direct myocardial injury, coronary injury, prolonged periods of bypass or cross-clamp all have been reported as causes of reversible and irreversible myocardial injury.

# 20 **How is the temperature of the patient controlled whilst on cardiopulmonary bypass?**

- Heat loss occurs from the skin and mucous membranes by radiation, conduction, convection and evaporation.
- The CPB heater-cooler can further manipulate temperature (Figure 9). A tank provides temperature controlled closed water circuits (isolated from the patient) to two heat exchangers incorporated in the cardioplegia circuit and oxygenator circuits.

![](_page_20_Figure_6.jpeg)

**Figure 9. Heater cooler unit attached to the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit (red arrows), with the heat exchange mat (zigzag lines) that separates heater-cooler water flow from patient blood flow.**

- Monitoring venous and arterial blood temperatures detects any thermal gradient. It is important to maintain this gradient <10°C to avoid microbubble formation during rewarming.
- As children lose heat more readily than adults due to a relatively large body surface area in relation to their body mass, smaller gradients between the core and peripheral temperatures are used, as infants on

CPB regulate body temperature ineffectively. Large gradients result in rapid heat loss from the core compartment to the peripheral tissues.

- Children more often have shunts or collateral vessels, requiring deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) to provide a clear surgical field.
- 21 **What measures are used by the perfusionist to optimise cerebral protection during surgery for congenital cardiac disease?**
- Brain O2 supply (delivery) should be optimised and demand reduced, which is particularly important in children, with their higher O2 demand.

Oxygen delivery = Cardiac output (CO) x Oxygen content

where: CO = Stroke volume (SV) x Heart rate (HR)

Oxygen content = (Hb x 1.34 x SpO2) + (PaO2 x 0.03)

- Optimising oxygen delivery pre- and post-surgery may be achieved by maintaining:
  - a) adequate haemoglobin (Hb) levels with transfusion triggers varying with age (children Hb 90g/L, adults 80g/L) and disease (cyanotic disease Hb 120g/L). This can also be aided by minimising CPB circuit volumes;
  - b) adequate arterial oxygen saturations;
  - c) cerebral blood flow by increasing CPB flow or CO2 levels (with resultant vasodilatation).
- Reduced oxygen demand can be achieved with:
  - a) reduced temperature (ice packs are more useful in infants where the fontanelles are unfused);
  - b) effective sedation/analgesia.
- Tissue oxygenation can be monitored using:
  - a) internal jugular venous saturation where levels >95% suggest minimal cerebral O2 extraction;
  - b) near-infrared spectrophotometry (NIRS) which provides continuous transcranial arterial saturation levels.
- Although the evidence of their effects on long-term outcomes is uncertain, a number of drugs have also been used to aid cerebral protection, including:

- a) corticosteroids which potentially reduce inflammation but may increase infection risk;
- b) mannitol which can reduce fluid overload but may affect intracellular neuronal volume with severely damaging effects.
- Antegrade or retrograde cerebral perfusion can also be used to reduce brain injury (Figure 10).

Flow to the circle of Willis is delivered by the distal arm of the arterial line to the right brachiocephalic artery (via an interposition graft) which has been clamped proximally. Flow to the coronaries is delivered by the proximal arm of the arterial line to the aortic root, which has been clamped distal to the cannula. The left common carotid artery (LCCA) and left subclavian artery (LSCA) have been individually snared (not shown). The arch is now accessible beyond the isthmus while on beating heart and brain perfusion.

• Acid-base management is important as a reduction in temperature produces an increased solubility of CO2 (Boyle's law), reduced pCO2 and a higher pH (i.e. metabolic alkalosis). During hypothermia, two different methods can be used to maintain homeostasis, including:

- a) alpha stat strategy which allows the pCO2 to drift as dictated by solubility, hence as the patient cools, the blood becomes more alkalotic. The potential advantages of this strategy include maintenance of the:
  - i) autoregulatory capacity of the cerebral arteries which couples cerebral blood flow to O2 demand. Hence, the reduced flow may minimise damage caused by microemboli;
  - ii) buffering capacity of the alpha imidazole group of histidine and more normal protein function;
  - iii) intracellular electromechanical neutrality which is essential for normal cellular function;
- b) pH stat strategy which maintains pCO2 at 5.3kPa and a pH of 7.4 at the patient's temperature, by the addition of CO2. The potential advantages of this strategy include:
  - i) increased flow to the cerebral vessels which results in improved cerebral cooling, at a cost of increased embolic load;
  - ii) minimising the left shift of the O2 dissociation curve that occurs with hypothermia, hence O2 can more easily be unloaded to the tissues.
- The best strategy is unclear, with pH stat maybe better with DHCA, as cerebral vasodilation and increased blood flow provides more O2 during cerebral cooling. There is some evidence of an advantage in paediatric patients but less so in adults. Alpha stat is used for rewarming.

# 22 **What are the indications for deep hypothermic circulatory arrest in congenital cardiac surgery?**

- The use of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest in congenital cardiac surgery is uncommon and it is generally limited to certain operations, including:
  - a) aortic arch surgery where regional perfusion of carotid and/or coronary arteries can be used to minimise injury, such as:
    - i) coarctation of the aorta with hypoplasia of the aortic arch requiring full arch reconstruction;

- ii) interrupted aortic arch requiring complex reconstruction (as in cases of long segments of interruption);
- iii) Norwood procedure;
- iv) rare aneurysms of the aorta (PHACES complex);
- v) descending aortic surgery, such as redo-repair of coarctation of the aorta or its complications to protect the spinal cord against ischaemia and paraplegia;
- b) complex neonatal and paediatric surgery where multiple systemic-pulmonary collaterals return blood to the left side of the heart and/or pulmonary arteries;
- c) difficult cases of obstructed total anomalous pulmonary venous connection;
- d) unifocalisation of major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs).

# 23 **What are the principles of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest?**

- During total DHCA, no tissues are perfused and O2 debt is inevitable, despite the reduced basal metabolic rate.
- As cerebral metabolism decreases 6-7% for every 1°C fall in temperature, the patient is usually cooled to 15-20°C before initiating circulatory arrest.
- The risks of DHCA include:
  - a) impaired microcirculation due to increased plasma viscosity, vasoconstriction and reduced erythrocyte plasticity. This can be minimised by haemodilution by bringing the haematocrit to 20% at 20°C but at the risk of inadequate O2 delivery during rewarming;
  - b) neurological injury and reduced postoperative neurocognitive function;
  - c) coagulopathy and platelet dysfunction;
  - d) systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) with associated capillary leak, oedema and organ dysfunction.
- Safety is both time- and temperature-dependent (Table 1), with major changes in mortality, such as low mortality at 18°C for 45 minutes of DHCA whereas 90 minutes of DHCA is associated with 90% mortality.
- Selective cerebral perfusion enhances brain protection and can be achieved with:
  - a) antegrade flow by cannulating the right axillary or subclavian arteries and clamping the brachiocephalic artery, thereby

directing flow to the right common carotid artery. An additional cannula can be placed in the left common carotid artery. Recommended flows range between 10-30mL/kg/min with a perfusion pressure 30-70mmHg (Figure 11);

b) retrograde flow — by attaching the arterial line or a shunt to the superior vena cava. Recommended flows range between 250- 400mL/min with a perfusion pressure of 25-40mmHg. The presence of deoxygenated blood in the aortic arch is indicative of cerebral O2 uptake (Figure 12).

# 24 **What are the principles of renal protection during cardiopulmonary bypass?**

• The kidneys are particularly at risk of damage during periods of low flow or low pressure, resulting in retention of excess fluid and solutes, and loss of protein.

- Haemofiltration before, during or after CPB can remove excess plasma water and solutes. The different techniques used during cardiac surgery include:
  - a) continuous ultrafiltration (CUF) where the whole circuit, including the patient, is filtered during CPB;
  - b) zero-balance ultrafiltration (ZBUF) where a high-volume circuit ultrafiltration is performed during rewarming;
  - c) modified ultrafiltration (MUF) where, following separation from CPB, blood is removed from the arterial line, passed through the haemofilter, and then returned to the patient via the venous cannula. Careful volume management is required to avoid hypotension consequent upon reduction in preload and cardiac output.
- Measuring DO2 (oxygen delivery), with <sup>a</sup> target range of 270- 280mL/min/m2, has more recently been used as a goal-directed perfusion strategy (with the addition of a high haematocrit) and has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of postoperative acute renal dysfunction.

# 25 **What are the principles of anticoagulation reversal following surgery for congenital cardiac disease?**

- Reversal of anticoagulation is typically performed with protamine, which is a cation derived from salmon sperm. It is strongly alkaline thereby attracting the strongly acidic heparin from its binding site on anti-thrombin III. Inadequate doses of protamine leave free heparin circulating.
- Protamine reactions can be classified as:
  - a) Class 1 which is characterised by hypotension triggered by histamine. It is treated by fluid and vasopressors;
  - b) Class 2a which is true anaphylaxis, triggered by IgE antibodies. It is treated with immediate cessation of protamine, and administration of adrenaline, hydrocortisone, chlorphenamine and bronchodilators;
  - c) Class 2b/c which are immediate (b) and delayed (c) anaphylactoid reactions, mediated by the complement cascade, and usually less severe than class 2a;
  - d) Class 3 which is characterised by catastrophic pulmonary vasoconstriction, caused by complement activation and release of thromboxane A2 that results in pulmonary

hypertension, RV failure, circulatory shock and severe bronchospasm. It is treated with immediate cessation of protamine, commencement of adrenaline and milrinone, and often reinstitution of CPB (with heparin administered).

# 26 **What are the main features of blood conservation and bleeding in congenital cardiac surgery?**

- Paediatric patients pose a unique challenge to blood conservation due to:
  - a) small blood volume;
  - b) requirements for a higher haematocrit (to deliver O2) during CPB;
  - c) increased rate of cyanotic heart disease;
  - d) immature coagulation system and association with congenital deficiency of coagulation factors;
  - e) increased risk of platelet dysfunction;
  - f) profound hypothermia is used more commonly.
- Adult patients with congenital heart disease may be more prone to bleeding due to:
  - a) redo operation especially as pre-emptive femoral CPB may be necessary, which is associated with prolonged mediastinal dissection during anticoagulation and may result in significant cumulative blood loss;
  - b) abnormal coagulation systems;
  - c) more challenging to cross-match blood due to antibody production following previous transfusions.
- In congenital patients with smaller blood volume, some techniques are used to reduce the risk of requiring blood transfusion, including:
  - a) retrograde autologous priming (RAP) and antegrade autologous priming to displace bypass prime with the patient's own blood;
  - b) miniature circuits with vacuum-assisted venous drainage to reduce haemodilution;
  - c) using whole blood (with high hematocrit) from the venous line, which is given directly to the anaesthetist before protamine is administered but after the completion of the modified ultrafiltration process.

# 27 **What are the strategies to limit or prevent blood loss in congenital cardiac surgery?**

- Antifibrinolytic agents which may reduce the risk of bleeding and total transfusion requirement, including:
  - a) tranexamic acid which binds to plasminogen to inhibit fibrinolysis, thereby reduces bleeding following surgery. It is given as a 100mg/kg bolus followed by an intra-operative infusion of 10mg/kg/h;
  - b) aprotinin which is a plasmin and kallikrein inhibitor, which slows fibrinolysis and inhibits factor XIIa formation, and has been shown to reduce postoperative mediastinal blood loss and transfusion requirements. It has anti-inflammatory effects that result in a decreased level of cytokines, including interleukin (IL)- 6, IL-8, tumour necrosis factor-α, and expression of macrophage 1 antigen. The Blood Conservation Using Antifibrinolytics in a Randomized Trial (BART) demonstrated that aprotinin is associated with an increased risk of death, stroke, renal impairment and heart failure, which led to a temporary suspension of its use. In 2012, the European Medicines Regulation Agency, however, reinstituted its use after the results were not replicated and further data suggested greater benefits than risks in cardiac surgery. It is given as follows:
    - i) initial test dose of 1mL = 10,000KIU;
    - ii) loading dose of 4mL/kg = 40,000KIU/kg (max. 2 million KIU);
    - iii) pump prime dose of 4mL/kg = 40,000KIU/kg (max. 2 million KIU);
    - iv) constant infusion dose of 1-2mL/kg/hr = 10,000- 20,000KIU/kg/hr.
- Topical haemostatic agents which reduce blood loss after cardiac surgery and have a role in reducing both surgical (anastomotic) and non-surgical (tissue surface) bleeding, including:
  - a) fibrin sealants which contain varying combinations of fibrinogen, thrombin and aprotinin, emulating the final stages of the clotting cascade, such as Tisseel (Baxter, USA) and Evicel (J&J Medical Devices, USA);
  - b) tissue adhesives which contain bovine serum albumin and glutaraldehyde, creating a protein hydrogel mechanical seal independent of the coagulation system, such as BioGlue

- (Cryolife Inc, USA). BioGlue cannot be used in children as it does not allow growth of tissue;
- c) gelatin matrices which swell and control bleeding with a combination of mechanical tamponade and induction of clot formation that is thrombin-induced, such as Floseal (J&J Medical Devices, USA), Surgiflo (Baxter, USA), Surgicel (Ethicon, USA), Gelfoam (Pfizer, Canada);
- d) platelet-rich fibrin which is used as an autologous fibrin sealant that is derived from the patient's own blood (usually 120mL of blood taken in the anaesthetic room pre-operatively) that can be effective with bleeding around suture lines and supports tissue regeneration and wound healing, such as Vivostat PRF®.
- Viscoelastic tests including a thromboelastogram (TEG®) and ROTEM®, that may guide transfusion policy, and the optimisation of blood and blood products usage.
- Filtration which can remove excess water and small molecules (<12,000Da), thereby concentrating platelets and clotting factors.
- Erythropoietin therapy which, if used pre-operatively, can reduce transfusion requirements in those with a low haemoglobin.
- Autologous blood donation which is only useful over the age of 3 years and body weight of >15kg.

### 28 **What are the principles of management of cardiopulmonary bypass in the presence of an aortopulmonary shunt?**

- Establishment of cardiopulmonary bypass with cessation of systemic ejection will result in excessive pulmonary run-off from an aortopulmonary shunt with systemic hypoperfusion.
- Examples of aortopulmonary shunts include:
  - a) ductus arteriosus;
  - b) major aortopulmonary collateral arteries;
  - c) surgical aortopulmonary shunts, such as a BT shunt or central Gore-Tex® shunt;
  - d) multiple small aortopulmonary vessels in the mediastinum of severely cyanosed patients.
- Although aortopulmonary shunts should ideally be controlled prior to commencing CPB, this may not be possible in duct- or shuntdependent circulations, if the shunt is difficult to access, or if there are multiple small aortopulmonary collaterals.

- Shunt-dependent pulmonary circulations should be controlled shortly after commencing bypass. Shunt-dependent systemic circulations require a period of cooling to help preserve end-organ function until completion of the surgical repair.
- Ejection of the heart during cooling helps to maintain systemic perfusion pressures. Elevated bypass flows and the use of vasopressors may also be required.
- Once the shunt is controlled, bypass and surgical repair can be conducted in the usual fashion.
- If the shunt cannot be controlled, hypothermia reduces tissue O2 demand, thereby allowing a temporary reduction of bypass flow with a resultant reduction in pulmonary run-off.
- The use of deep hypothermic arrest during intracardiac repair may occasionally be necessary to manage the otherwise excessive left atrial return and to provide adequate visibility in the surgical field.
- Once the heart stops ejecting, adequate left atrial drainage is mandatory to avoid severe congestion of the lungs by the significant pulmonary venous return.
