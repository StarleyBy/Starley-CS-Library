## Atrial septal defects

**Narain Moorjani, Nicola Viola**

- 1 **What is an atrial septal defect (ASD)?**
- An atrial septal defect is a congenital lesion that results in communication and therefore shunting of blood between the left and right atria.
- 2 **How is the atrial septum formed embryologically?**
- The cavity of the primitive atrium is initially subdivided into right and left chambers by the septum primum, which is a crescentic fold of endocardial tissue that begins to develop at day 28 in utero (Figure 1).

![](_page_0_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Figure 1. Development of the septum primum.**

- The septum primum grows downwards to close the primary interatrial foramen by fusing with the endocardial cushions by approximately day 35, leaving an opening below its free margin (ostium primum).
- By programmed cell death (apoptosis), a second opening (ostium secundum or foramen ovale) develops in the upper part of the septum primum at day 33. This opening persists until birth.
- At a similar time (day 33), a second endocardial fold (septum secundum), semilunar in shape, develops and descends towards but never reaches the endocardial cushions, thereby forming the fossa ovalis (Figure 2).

**Figure 2. Development of the septum secundum.**

- Shortly after birth, the foramen ovale closes following fusion of the septum secundum with the septum primum (Figure 3).
- Hence, the component parts of the final true atrial septum (Figure 4) include the:
  - a) floor of the fossa ovalis which is derived from the septum primum;
  - b) anteroinferior muscular rim of the fossa ovalis.

### 3 **How are atrial septal defects classified (Figure 5)?**

- Defects of the interatrial septum:
  - a) fossa ovalis defects (75%):
    - i) patent foramen ovale (Vieussens valve) superiorly placed;
    - ii) ostium secundum defect centrally placed, can be single or multi-fenestrated (Figure 5B);
  - b) vestibular defect (<1%) muscular defect in the anteroinferior rim of the fossa ovalis, outside the triangle of Koch (Figure 5C).
- Defects outside the interatrial septum:
  - a) sinus venosus defect (5-10%) which usually occurs at the superior vena cava-right atrial junction (superior defect), but may also occur at the inferior vena cava-right atrial junction (inferior defect) (Figure 5D);
  - b) coronary sinus defect (1%) which represents an unroofed coronary sinus (Figure 5E);
  - c) other types: cor triloculare biatriatum (<1%).
- Defects of the atrioventricular septum:
  - a) ostium primum defect (15-20%) which is also known as a partial atrioventricular septal defect (Figure 5F).
- Embryologically, only lesions in the fossa ovalis (ostium secundum defects, patent foramen ovale and vestibular defects) are considered true atrial septal defects.
- Surgically, however, all interatrial communications, including ostium primum defects, sinus venosus defects and coronary sinus defects, as well as the fossa ovalis lesions, are referred to as atrial septal defects.

#### 4 **What is the aetiology of atrial septal defects?**

- An ostium secundum defect is caused by abnormal reabsorption of the septum primum or incomplete overlap of the septum secundum with the septum primum.
- An ostium primum defect is caused by incomplete fusion of the septum primum with the endocardial cushions, resulting in a gap at the level of the atrioventricular valves. The left atrioventricular valve is usually displaced, whereas the right atrioventricular valve is rarely involved.
- A sinus venosus defect is caused by incomplete fusion of the embryological sinus venosus with the atrial septum, most commonly near the junction with the superior vena cava.

**Figure 5. Atrial septal defects: A) normal anatomy of the right atrial cavity; B) multi-fenestrated ostium secundum defect; C) vestibular defect; D) sinus venosus defect (superior and inferior type) and patent foramen ovale; E) multi-fenestrated coronary sinus defect; F) ostium primum defect and patent foramen ovale.**

- A patent foramen ovale is caused by incomplete fusion of the septum primum with the septum secundum.
- Atrial septal defects can also have an iatrogenic aetiology, either during catheter-based procedures (such as percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy) or cardiac surgery (such as atrial myxoma excision or left atriotomy for mitral valve surgery).

#### 5 **What abnormalities are often associated with atrial septal defects?**

- Trifoliate left atrioventricular valve with or without regurgitation (associated with ostium primum defects).
- Anomalous pulmonary venous connections (partial and total, associated with sinus venosus defects or fossa ovalis defects).
- Left-sided superior vena cava (associated with coronary sinus defects).
- Asplenia.
- Atrial septal defects are ten times more likely to occur in association with other anomalies than as isolated defects.

### 6 **What is the epidemiology of atrial septal defects?**

- Account for 7% of all congenital cardiac abnormalities (second only to bicuspid aortic valve).
- Female to male ratio is 2:1.
- Increased incidence in patients with Down's syndrome.

### 7 **What is the pathophysiology of an atrial septal defect?**

- Due to the difference in compliance between the left and right ventricles, blood usually flows across the defect as a left-to-right shunt, predominantly in late systole and during diastole.
- The magnitude of the shunt depends on the:
  - a) size of the defect;
  - b) compliance of the left and right ventricles;
  - c) systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance.
- This results in volume overload of the right-sided chambers, with subsequent enlargement of the right atrium, right ventricle and pulmonary artery.
- Initially, the shunt is well tolerated whilst the pulmonary vascular resistance remains low, but if left uncorrected, atrial arrhythmias, right ventricular failure and possibly pulmonary hypertension eventually ensue.

### 8 **What is the natural history of atrial septal defects?**

- Although most patients with an untreated defect usually survive into adulthood, their life expectancy is not normal in comparison to an age-matched population.
- Survival from a cardiac standpoint is influenced by the clinical sequelae of:
  - a) atrial arrhythmias;
  - b) right ventricular dysfunction;
  - c) pulmonary hypertension;
  - d) stroke;
  - e) shunt reversal and Eisenmenger syndrome (in rare cases).

### 9 **What are the symptoms of an atrial septal defect?**

- The timing of the clinical presentation depends on the degree of the left-to-right shunt and subsequent haemodynamic consequences.
- Most patients are hence asymptomatic.
- Patients may eventually present with:
  - a) reduced exercise tolerance and fatigue;
  - b) recurrent respiratory infections;
  - c) palpitations (secondary to atrial arrhythmias);
  - d) syncope;
  - e) stroke (secondary to paradoxical embolism);
  - f) congestive cardiac failure.

### 10 **What are the signs of an atrial septal defect?**

- The physical signs elicited depend on the haemodynamic consequences and relate to the:
  - a) size of the defect;
  - b) degree of the left-to-right shunt;
  - c) relative compliance of the left and right ventricles;
  - d) systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances.
- Parasternal heave of the right ventricle (due to increased diastolic filling and subsequent increased right ventricular stroke volume).
- Split S1 (caused by increased intensity of T1 due to delayed closure of the tricuspid valve).
- Fixed splitting of the 2nd heart sound (which does not vary during respiration).
- Pansystolic flow murmur at the left sternal edge in the 2nd intercostal space (due to increased blood flow across the pulmonary valve and not due to flow across the atrial septal defect).

- Soft mid-diastolic murmur at the left sternal edge in the 4th intercostal space (due to the increased flow through the tricuspid valve).
- An apical pansystolic murmur of mitral regurgitation may be heard in patients with an ostium primum defect.
- If the patient develops pulmonary hypertension, further signs include:
  - a) early diastolic murmur (Graham Still murmur, representing pulmonary regurgitation);
  - b) disappearance of the split 2nd heart sound, pansystolic flow murmur and the mid-diastolic rumble.
- Cyanosis and clubbing are only present in patients with shunt reversal (Eisenmenger syndrome).

#### 11 **What are the electrocardiographic features of atrial septal defects (Figure 6)?**

• Axis deviation:

- a) ostium secundum defect right axis deviation;
- b) ostium primum defect left axis deviation;
- c) sinus venosus defect left axis deviation.
- Incomplete right bundle branch block (secondary to the right ventricular volume overload), resulting in an rSR' pattern in V1 and a wide S wave in leads I, II and V6.
- Right ventricular hypertrophy, demonstrated by a tall R wave (>10mm) in V1.
- Usually normal sinus rhythm, but atrial fibrillation is often present in patients aged >40 years old.

**Figure 6. Electrocardiogram of a patient with an ostium secundum defect, demonstrating an rSR' pattern in V1.**

#### 12 **What are the radiological features of atrial septal defects (Figure 7)?**

- Chest radiography may demonstrate:
  - a) cardiomegaly (due to right atrial and right ventricular enlargement);
  - b) prominent pulmonary arteries (dilated hilar vessels) with increased pulmonary vascular markings (Figure 7);

![](_page_8_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Figure 7. Chest radiographs demonstrating increased pulmonary vascular markings, hilar congestion and a distended right atrium in: A) an 18-month-old child with a large ostium secundum defect; and B) a 67 year-old patient with a superior sinus venosus defect.**

- c) in patients with ostium primum defects, left atrial enlargement may be observed if significant mitral regurgitation is present;
- d) in patients with sinus venosus defects, proximal dilation of the superior vena cava may be seen.
- Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be useful to further delineate associated anomalies and the haemodynamic consequences of volume overload of the right heart and pulmonary circulation (Figure 8).

**Figure 8. Cardiac MRI in a patient with a sinus venosus defect demonstrating an enlarged right ventricle (RV). LV = left ventricle.**

#### 13 **What are the echocardiographic features of atrial septal defects?**

- Echocardiography can be used to definitively diagnose the type of anatomical defect with 2D and 3D images (Figure 9).
- Colour-flow Doppler is used to quantify the shunt across the atrial septum (Figure 10).

SVC = superior vena cava; IVC = inferior vena cava; RA = right atrium; LA = left atrium; LAVV = left atrioventricular valve; RAVV = right atrioventricular valve.**

**Figure 10. Transoesophageal echocardiogram demonstrating a moderate-large left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum on colour-flow Doppler. RA = right atrium; LA = left atrium.**

- Echocardiography can also demonstrate the haemodynamic consequences of the defect, including:
  - a) right ventricular chamber size and function (degree of dilatation and dysfunction) (Figure 11);
  - b) right atrial enlargement;
  - c) pulmonary artery dilatation;
  - d) tricuspid regurgitation.
- It is also important to identify any associated cardiac abnormalities, including:
  - a) cleft mitral and mitral regurgitation (in ostium primum defects);
  - b) persistent left-sided superior vena cava (in coronary sinus defects);
  - c) anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (in sinus venosus defects) (Figure 12).

### 14 **Describe the bubble test (Figure 13)**

- Sterile saline is agitated by passing it between two syringes to produce tiny bubbles.
- Following intravenous injection of the saline, echocardiographic images of the left and right atrium are monitored.

![](_page_12_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Figure 13. Bubble test demonstrated on serial transthoracic apical fourchamber images: A) the right atrium (RA) and ventricle (RV) are filled with bubbles; B) during a Valsalva manoeuvre, the bubbles fill the left atrium (LA) first; and then C) the left ventricle (LV).**

- If the atrial septum is intact, the bubbles should remain on the right side.
- Bubbles within the left atrium indicate a communication between the atria, suggestive of an atrial septal defect.

## 15 What are cardiac catheterisation findings of atrial septal defects?

- Routine cardiac catheterisation is unnecessary in children with a previously diagnosed uncomplicated atrial septal defect.
- For patients with pulmonary hypertension, associated congenital abnormalities or age over 40 with suspected coronary artery disease, cardiac catheterisation is an important component of the surgical work-up.
- Oxygen saturation measurements in the systemic and pulmonary circulations will reveal a step-up in right ventricular and pulmonary artery oxygen saturations (Table 1).

Table 1. Cardiac catheterisation data demonstrating a step-up in right atrial (RA) oxygen saturations in an adult patient with an ostium secundum defect. SVC = superior vena cava; MPA = main pulmonary artery; LPA = left pulmonary artery; FA = femoral artery; RUPV = right upper pulmonary vein; BCV = brachiocephalic vein; IVC = inferior vena cava; EDP = end-diastolic pressure.

- High oxygen saturations in the superior vena cava may indicate the presence of a sinus venosus defect.
- Cardiac catheterisation also allows the size of the shunt to be quantified by calculating the shunt fraction.

#### 16 **How do you calculate the shunt fraction (Qp:Qs) (Figure 14)?**

• Using the Fick principle:

Flow = 
$$O_2$$
 consumption   
arteriovenous  $O_2$  concentration difference

Flow = 
$$\frac{O_2 \text{ consumption}}{(\text{arteriovenous } O_2 \text{ sats difference x Hb x 1.34 x 10})}$$

Pulmonary flow = 
$$O_2$$
 consumption  
[(PV sats - PA sats) x Hb x 1.34 x 10]

Systemic flow = 
$$\frac{O_2 \text{ consumption}}{[(\text{Ao sats - RA sats}) \times \text{Hb} \times 1.34 \times 10]}$$

As O2 consumption and Hb are the same in both equations Pulmonary flow: systemic flow ratio (shunt ratio)

Qp:Qs = (Ao sats - RA sats) (PV sats - PA sats)

RA sats = 
$$(3 \times SVC \text{ sats}) + (1 \times IVC \text{ sats})$$

PV = pulmonary vein; PA = pulmonary artery; Ao = aorta; RA = right atrium; SVC = superior vena cava; IVC = inferior vena cava; Hb = haemoglobin; sats = oxygen saturations.

![](_page_15_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 14. Shunt calculation based on the Fick principle. RA sats = ([3 x 64] + [1 x 68]) / 4 = 65%. Measured PA saturations = 82%. Measured PV saturations = 99%. Assuming aortic and PV saturation are equal, the Qp:Qs shunt in this patient will be: (99 - 65) / (99 - 82) = 34 / 17 = 2:1.**

#### 17 **What are the therapeutic options for <sup>a</sup> patient with an atrial septal defect?**

- Conservative management:
  - a) infants with an ostium secundum defect <8mm (as 66% close within 18 months);
  - b) adults with a Qp:Qs ratio of <1.5;
  - c) patients with severe pulmonary vascular resistance, shunt reversal and fixed pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery systolic pressure [PASP] >60mmHg, pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR] >12 WU).
- Medical therapy to optimise patients with atrial arrhythmias and right ventricular volume overload prior to intervention.

- Percutaneous closure.
- Surgery.

## 18 What are the indications for therapeutic closure of an atrial septal defect?

- A Qp:Qs ratio of >2.
- Atrial arrhythmia.
- Reversible pulmonary hypertension.
- Right ventricular dysfunction.
- Patent foramen ovale in patients with a demonstrated right-to-left shunt (by saturations or bubble study) and recurrent paradoxical cerebral emboli.

## 19 What are the contraindications for therapeutic closure of an atrial septal defect?

- Asymptomatic patient with a clinically insignificant atrial septal defect (Qp:Qs <1.5).</li>
- Shunt reversal with fixed pulmonary hypertension (PASP >60mmHg, PVR >12 WU).

## 20 What are the principles of device closure for an atrial septal defect (Figure 15)?

- Device closure is only suitable in patients with:
  - a) ostium secundum defects (within the fossa ovalis);
  - b) 5mm rim from the defect to the valves and major veins;
  - c) defect <40mm in size.
- General anaesthesia or local anaesthesia with sedation.
- Femoral venous access with fluoroscopic and transoesophageal guidance.
- The diameter of the defect is measured both by echocardiography and sizing balloon.
- Deployment of the occluder device.
- There are several types of occluder devices available, including:
  - a) AMPLATZER™ Septal Occluder (St Jude Medical, St Paul, MN, USA) (Figure 16);
  - b) CardioSEAL® Septal Occlusion System (NNMT Medical, Boston, MA, USA);
  - c)  $\mathsf{HELEX}^{\circledR}$  Septal Occluder (Gore, Flagstaff, AZ, USA).

## 22 What structures are at risk during surgical repair of an atrial septal defect?

- Conduction system (during repair of ostium primum defects).
- Mitral valve (during repair of ostium primum defects).
- Right superior and inferior pulmonary veins (during repair of sinus venosus defects).
- Sinoatrial node and nutrient artery (during repair of superior sinus venosus defects).

## 23 What are the principles of surgery for an ostium secundum defect (Figures 18 and 19)?

**Figure 18.** Repair of an ostium secundum defect using autologous pericardium. SVC = superior vena cava; TV = tricuspid valve; IVC = inferior vena cava.

- Bicaval venous cannulation with snares.
- Right atriotomy.
- Closure with autologous pericardium, bovine/porcine pericardium or direct suture.
- Appropriate de-airing of the left-sided cardiac structures.

**Figure 19.** Repair of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) using direct suture. SVC = superior vena cava; RAA = right atrial appendage; IVC = inferior vena cava.

#### 24 **What are the principles of surgery for an ostium primum defect?**

- Repair of an ostium primum defect follows the principles of repair of an atrioventricular septal defect, where no ventricular component is detected.
- A patch is attached to the crest of the ventricular septum at the junction of the left and right atrioventricular valves.
- It is important to avoid the atrioventricular node and bundle of His, which are displaced inferiorly and posteriorly, close to the coronary sinus.
- The ostium of the coronary sinus can lie on either the right or left side of the patch.
- Concomitant left atrioventricular valve repair, including closure of the anterior cleft with or without annuloplasty, should be performed in all cases.

#### 25 **What are the principles of surgery for <sup>a</sup> sinus venosus defect (Figure 20)?**

- The anomalous pulmonary blood is redirected back into the left atrium using an autologous or heterologous pericardial baffle, closing the defect at the same time.
- To avoid possible stenosis at the cavoatrial junction, the superior vena cava can be detached and reimplanted on the atrial appendage (Warden procedure). Alternatively, a posterior atriotomy extending into the superior vena cava is then repaired with a second patch.
- It is important to avoid damage to the sinoatrial node and its nutrient artery.

#### 26 **What are the principles of surgery for <sup>a</sup> coronary sinus defect?**

- An unroofed coronary sinus is invariably found in association with a coronary sinus defect.
- The principles of repair in these patients includes:
  - a) re-roofing of the coronary sinus in its course along the posterior aspect of the mitral valve annulus;
  - b) closure of the interatrial defect using a second patch of autologous or heterologous pericardium.

Figure 20. Repair of a sinus venosus defect and partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection (PAPVC): A) the superior vena cava is cannulated at the junction with the innominate vein. The right atrium is opened through a posterior incision parallel to Waterston's groove, extending beyond the insertion of the pulmonary veins. A large sinus venosus defect is exposed below the overriding superior vena cava with the right superior and middle pulmonary veins clearly visible. A concomitant ostium secundum defect is also present; B) a baffling patch of autologous pericardium is used to redirect the pulmonary venous drainage across the sinus venosus defect into the left atrium: C) after completion of the sinus venosus repair, the concomitant ostium secundum defect is repaired primarily; D) a second patch of autologous pericardium is used to enlarge the cavo-atrial junction and the remaining portion of the atriotomy is closed primarily. SVC = superior vena cava; IAS = interatrial septum; RUPV = right upper pulmonary vein; RMPV = right middle pulmonary vein; RAA = right atrial appendage.

## 27 What are the complications of surgery following repair of an atrial septal defect?

- Thromboembolism.
- Atrial arrhythmias.
- Congestive heart failure.
- Pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction.
- Infective endocarditis (during the first 6 months following surgery).
- Residual shunts

- Surgical mortality in children is <1%. The type of atrial septal defect does not represent a significant risk factor.
- Overall mortality in adults can reach 10%. Coexistent malformations, pulmonary hypertension and atrial fibrillation represent significant risk factors.
- Atrioventricular block and the need for a permanent pacemaker (in ostium primum and coronary sinus defects).
- Mitral regurgitation and the need for reintervention (in ostium primum defects).
- Systemic venous return obstruction (in sinus venosus defects).

### 28 **What are the long-term outcomes of surgery?**

- Surgery in adults <25 years old results in long-term survival comparable to an age-matched population.
- In older patients with pre-operative atrial arrhythmias, right ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension, long-term survival following surgery is reduced compared to age-matched controls, but improved compared to medically treated patients.
- Older age at repair and pre-operative New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart failure are independent predictors of late mortality.
