# Infective endocarditis

**Paraskevi Theocharis, Nicola Viola, Tara Bharucha**

# 1 **What is infective endocarditis?**

- Infective endocarditis (IE) is defined as microbial infection of the endocardial surface of the heart.
- It may involve various intracardiac structures, such as one or more heart valves, the mural endocardium or a congenital defect.
- IE is also used to describe infections of a patent ductus arteriosus, surgical shunts (such as Blalock-Taussig shunt) or infection at an aortic coarctation site.
- The intracardiac infective lesions can cause complications, such as myocardial abscesses or valvular insufficiency, which may lead to intractable congestive heart failure.
- If untreated, IE is often fatal.

# 2 **How is infective endocarditis classified?**

- IE may be divided according to presentation:
  - a) acute (rapidly progressive) IE which may present as a fulminant illness over days or a few weeks, and is likely to be due to a pathogen, such as pí~éÜóäçÅçÅÅìë ~ìêÉìë, which is very virulent, and frequently causes metastatic infection;
  - b) subacute (chronic) IE which may progress slowly over weeks or months and is caused by a pathogen, such as píêÉéíçÅçÅÅìë, which has a low virulence and low propensity to spread via the bloodstream to extracardiac sites.
- The European Society of Cardiology classifies IE according to:
  - a) localisation and the presence of intracardiac prosthetic material:
    - i) left-sided native valve IE;
    - ii) left-sided prosthetic valve IE;
    - iii) right-sided IE;
    - iv) device-related IE (such as permanent pacemaker);

- b) mode of acquisition:
  - i) healthcare-associated IE (nosocomial or nonnosocomial);
  - ii) community-acquired IE;
  - iii) intravenous drug abuse-associated IE;
- c) active infection (clinical, surgical or pathological findings of IE);
- d) recurrence (relapse or reinfection).

# 3 **What is the epidemiology of infective endocarditis?**

- The annual incidence of infective endocarditis is cases per persons, with a male to female case ratio >2:1.
- The prevalence of IE in infants and children is increasing, probably due to the increasing survival of children with congenital heart disease, and the increasing use of indwelling central intravenous catheters and implantable intracardiac devices.
- The reported incidence of IE in children and adults with congenital heart disease varies widely, between times higher than the rest of the population.
- The most common congenital heart defects affected by IE include patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, coarctation of the aorta and mitral valve prolapse.
- Chronic rheumatic heart disease is still common in developing countries, where rheumatic fever remains prevalent, and congenital cardiac surgery is limited. Worldwide, the most common type of IE is on mitral and aortic valves affected by rheumatic heart disease.
- Approximately 10% of cases of IE in children develop with no known history of valvular disease. These infections are usually caused by pí~éÜóäçÅçÅÅìë ~ìêÉìë and are left-sided.
- Intravenous drug abuse is a common risk factor for IE in adults but not children.
- Degenerative heart disease is a common substrate for IE in adults, such as calcific aortic stenosis due to a bicuspid valve or Marfan syndrome.
- IE develops most commonly on the mitral valve, followed by in descending order the aortic valve, combined mitral and aortic valves, tricuspid valve, and, rarely, the pulmonary valve.
- The risk of infective endocarditis in patients with a prosthetic valve is 0.1-2.3% per patient year.
- Mechanical prosthetic and bioprosthetic valves exhibit equal rates of infection.

# 4 **What is the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis?**

- Intact endothelium is resistant to colonisation by bacteria. Infective endocarditis usually requires disruption of the endothelium, which is otherwise resistant to infection.
- Endothelial disruption may be caused by valvular lesions that result in turbulent non-laminar blood flow or by intravenous catheters on the right side of the heart.
- Platelets and fibrin are deposited over the damaged endothelium (non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis).
- If a bacteraemia occurs, the organisms may adhere to the site of endothelial disruption, with the development of infective endocarditis, potentially leading to invasion of the valvular leaflets and vegetation formation.
- A common cause of bacteraemia is trauma to the oral mucosa, gastrointestinal tract or genitourinary tract.

# 5 **What are the most common causes of infective endocarditis in patients with native valves?**

- Gram-positive organisms have the ability to adhere to endothelial surfaces and therefore account for most cases of IE.
- píêÉéíçÅçÅÅìë species cause approximately 70% of infections, including píêÉéK îáêáÇ~åë, píêÉéK Äçîáë, and enterococci. píêÉéK ãáääÉêá often cause abscesses.
- pí~éÜóäçÅçÅÅìë species cause approximately 25% of all cases and are associated with a more aggressive acute course. pí~éÜK ~ìêÉìë is very common in children and often affects normal valves, particularly in the presence of intravenous catheters and impaired immune response. pí~éÜK ~ìêÉìë often causes acute and destructive IE, whereas coagulase-negative pí~éÜK produce more protracted valve infections.
- The HACEK group of micro-organisms (e~ÉãçéÜáäìë species, ^ÅíáåçÄ~Åáääìë ~ÅíáåçãóÅÉíÉãÅçãáí~åë, `~êÇáçÄ~ÅíÉêáìã Üçãáåáë, báâÉåÉää~ ÅçêêçÇÉåë, háåÖÉää~ âáåÖ~É) are fastidious Gram-negative organisms, which are more commonly encountered with prosthetic valves.
- Fungal endocarditis, caused by organisms such as `~åÇáÇ~ ~äÄáÅ~åë, `~åÇáÇ~ ëíÉää~íçáÇÉ~ and ^ëéÉêÖáääìë species, is rare but may be seen in patients with long-term intravenous catheters, such as used for chemotherapy, antibiotics, parenteral nutrition or dialysis. Mortality is high, around 75%.

### 6 **What are the most common organisms in patients with prosthetic valve or intravascular device infective endocarditis?**

- Coagulase-negative pí~éÜóäçÅçÅÅìë is the most frequent (30%) cause of prosthetic valve endocarditis early (<12 months following surgery) and late (>12 months following surgery).
- Early prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is usually nosocomial and often caused by pí~éÜK ~ìêÉìë, which may be methicillin-resistant (MRSA). pí~éÜK ~ìêÉìë PVE carries a high risk of mortality and often requires early valve replacement.
- `çêóåÉÄ~ÅíÉêáìã, non-enterococcal streptococci, fungi, iÉÖáçåÉää~ and the HACEK organisms cause the majority of the remaining cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis.
- IE associated with intravenous devices often occurs in patients with no previous history of congenital heart disease. pí~éÜK ~ìêÉìë is the most common organism (accounting for >50% of cases), with the right-sided valves usually affected. The patient may present with pleuritic chest pain or other clinical evidence of embolism to the lungs.
- Nosocomial or healthcare-associated infective endocarditis are often related to intravascular devices, such as intravenous catheters, pacemakers, defibrillators or haemodialysis shunts. The predominant organisms are Gram-positive cocci, such as pí~éÜK ~ìêÉìë, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci or non-enterococcal streptococci.

# 7 **What are the causes of non-infective endocarditis?**

- Non-infective endocarditis is also known as non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) or marantic endocarditis.
- The vegetations that occur are sterile and composed mainly of fibrin and platelets. It is rare in children but can occur in patients with:
  - a) mucinous adenocarcinona (lung, pancreas, upper gastrointestinal tract);
  - b) other malignant disease (lymphoma, bladder carcinoma);
  - c) antiphospholipid syndrome (Hughes syndrome);
  - d) acute rheumatic fever (immune response to Group A β-haemolytic píêÉéíçÅçÅÅìë);
  - e) Libman-Sachs endocarditis (systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma).

# 8 **What are the clinical features of infective endocarditis?**

- The clinical history can be extremely varied and often does not reveal an incident that could have precipitated a bacteraemia.
- It is important to elicit any related factors, such as the patient's immune status, recent cardiac surgery (especially including prosthetic valves, conduits or shunts) and previous use of antibiotics.
- Antibiotic therapy should not be used blindly until the diagnosis of IE has been considered and multiple sets of blood cultures taken.
- Fever is extremely common but may be absent in neonates. A very high temperature may be seen in pí~éÜK ~ìêÉìë infections but may be low grade or intermittent in long-incubation IE.
- Non-specific features include malaise, fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, rigors, myalgia and arthralgia.
- Cardiac features include:
  - a) a new or changing heart murmur which is extremely suggestive of IE;
  - b) signs and symptoms of heart failure which are caused by valvular regurgitation or myocardial dysfunction;
  - c) myocardial infarction which is caused by coronary embolism of the vegetations;
  - d) global myocardial dysfunction which is caused by diffuse myocarditis;
  - e) anaemia which may exacerbate heart failure.

### • Embolic features include:

- a) stroke;
- b) myocardial infarction;
- c) cerebral abscess;
- d) mycotic aneurysms;
- e) gangrene of the extremities;
- f) renal or splenic infarction;
- g) Janeway lesions which are painless haemorrhagic cutaneous lesions on the palms and soles.

### • Vascular features include:

- a) intracranial haemorrhage;
- b) conjunctival haemorrhage;
- c) subungual splinter haemorrhage.

- Immunologic features include:
  - a) glomerulonephritis;
  - b) Osler's nodes which are painful subcutaneous lesions in the distal fingers;
  - c) Roth's spots on the retina;
  - d) positive serum rheumatoid factor.

# 9 **What are the principles of making <sup>a</sup> diagnosis of infective endocarditis?**

- Accuracy of diagnosis is important, as failure to treat IE is likely to be fatal, but over-diagnosis leads to prolonged use of unnecessary antimicrobial therapy.
- The diagnosis is made on clinical grounds, using the modified Duke criteria, which are subdivided into major and minor criteria (Table 1).
- Modified Duke major criteria include:
  - a) positive blood culture for infective endocarditis with:
    - i) typical organisms for IE (such as píêÉéíçÅçÅÅìë îáêáÇ~åë, píêÉéíçÅçÅÅìë Äçîáë, HACEK group, communityacquired pí~éÜK ~ìêÉìë or enterococci) isolated from two separate blood culture bottles; or
    - ii) microorganisms consistent with endocarditis from persistently positive blood cultures (cultures drawn >12 hours apart or three or more separate blood cultures drawn at least 1 hour apart);
  - b) evidence of endocardial involvement on echocardiogram, such as:
    - i) an oscillating intracardiac mass on a valve or supporting structure, in the path of regurgitant jets, or on implanted material, in the absence of an alternative anatomical explanation; or
    - ii) abscess; or
    - iii) new partial dehiscence of a prosthetic valve; or
    - iv) new-onset valvular regurgitation.
- Modified Duke minor criteria include:
  - a) predisposing factor (known cardiac lesion or intravenous drug use);
  - b) fever >38°C;

CT = computed tomography; FDG = fluorodeoxyglucose; HACEK = Haemophilus parainfluenzae, H. aphrophilus, H. paraphrophilus, H. influenzae, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, Kingella kingae, and K. denitrificans; IE = infective endocarditis; Ig = immunoglobulin; PET = positron emission tomography; SPECT = single photon emission computed tomography.

#### Major criteria

- ≥2 positive blood cultures of blood samples drawn >12h apart; or
- All of 3 or a majority of ≥4 separate cultures of blood (with first and last samples drawn ≥1h apart); or
- c. Single positive blood culture for *Coxiella burnetii* or phase I IgG antibody titre >1:800.

#### 2. Imaging positive for IE

- a. Echocardiogram positive for IE:
- Vegetation;
- Abscess, pseudoaneurysm, intracardiac fistula;
- Valvular perforation or aneurysm;
- New partial dehiscence of a prosthetic valve.
- b. Abnormal activity around the site of prosthetic valve implantation detected by <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT (only if the prosthesis was implanted for >3 months) or radiolabelled leukocytes SPECT/CT.
- c. Definite paravalvular lesions detected by cardiac CT.

- 4. Immunological phenomena: glomerulonephritis, Osler's nodes, Roth spots, and rheumatoid factor.
- Microbiological evidence: positive blood culture but does not meet a major criterion (as noted above) or serological evidence of active infection with organism consistent with IE.

- c) vascular phenomena including major arterial emboli, septic pulmonary infarcts, myocotic aneuryms, Janeway lesions or conjunctival haemorrhages;
- d) immunological phenomena including glomerulonephritis, Osler's nodes, Roth's spots or positive rheumatoid factor;

- f) echocardiographic findings consistent with IE but not satisfying a major criterion.

# 10 **What is the significance of the modified Duke criteria?**

- According to the Duke criteria, the diagnosis of infective endocarditis can be definite, possible or rejected.
- Definite:
  - a) pathology or bacteriology of vegetations, major emboli or intracardiac abscess specimen; or
  - b) 2 major criteria; or
  - c) 1 major and 3 minor criteria; or
  - d) 5 minor criteria.

### • Possible:

- a) 1 major and 1 minor criterion; or
- b) 3 minor criteria.

# • Rejected:

- a) there is a firm alternative diagnosis; or
- b) resolution of manifestations within 4 days of antimicrobial treatment; or
- c) no pathologic evidence of infective endocarditis at surgery or at post-mortem after antibiotic treatment of <4 days; or
- d) does not meet definite or possible criteria.

# 11 **What is the role of echocardiography in infective endocarditis?**

• Imaging plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis and clinical decisionmaking in the management of IE.

- Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the first-line imaging modality in IE and is helpful in supporting the diagnosis, as it may facilitate detection of vegetations or other evidence of endocarditis, such as an intracardiac abscess or new dehiscence of a prosthetic valve.
- Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) is recommended in all patients with a clinical suspicion of IE but with a negative or nondiagnostic TTE. It should also be considered in most patients, even if the TTE has positive findings. TOE is an invasive procedure and may require general anaesthetic in children.
- TTE has an overall sensitivity in detecting vegetations of 70% in native valves, as compared to the sensitivity of TOE of 96%. For prosthetic valves, the sensitivity of TTE to detect vegetations is 50%, as compared to 92% for TOE.
- If the initial TTE and TOE examinations are negative but clinical suspicion of IE remains high, consideration should be given to repeating the investigations after 1 week.
- Intra-operative echocardiography is recommended for all patients undergoing surgery for IE.
- Echocardiography is the major imaging modality for follow-up of potential complications, including abscess formation, valve destruction and perforation, rupture of chordae, development or progression of prosthetic paravalvular leaks.
- TTE is also used at the completion of antimicrobial therapy in order to evaluate valve structure and function, myocardial function and the presence of any residual vegetations.
- Newer imaging modalities, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT), may improve the sensitivity of the Duke criteria, and in selected patients may be helpful to clarify cardiac involvement or the presence of embolic events.

# 12 **What are the principles of obtaining <sup>a</sup> microbiological diagnosis?**

- The medical team should focus on making the correct diagnosis and stabilising the patient with acute disease and cardiovascular instability. General measures may include anti-failure treatment, dialysis and respiratory support, as indicated.
- Blood cultures must be taken prior to the administration of antibiotics, otherwise it is extremely unlikely that the organism will be correctly identified, and targeted antibiotic therapy becomes difficult. At least three sets of blood cultures should be taken for incubation,

- ideally at least 30 minutes apart, with attention paid to sterile technique in order to avoid contamination. It is unnecessary to delay taking blood until the fever reaches a peak.
- Blood cultures will usually be positive within 48 hours of incubation but fastidious bacteria and fungi may take longer to grow.
- Blood cultures should be repeated after hours of antimicrobial therapy in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of treatment.
- In nearly one third of all cases of IE, blood cultures remain negative. This is known as blood culture-negative IE.
- A common cause of blood culture-negative IE is antibiotic administration prior to the procurement of blood cultures. In this scenario, antibiotics should be withdrawn and blood cultures obtained.
- Blood culture-negative IE may also be caused by fastidious bacteria, such as `çñáÉää~ ÄìêåÉíáá, \_~êíçåÉää~ ëééK, jóÅçéä~ëã~ éåÉìãçåá~É, and by fungi, such as `~åÇáÇ~ ëééK and ^ëéÉêÖáääìë ëééK Specialised culture media may be required to isolate these organisms.
- Blood PCR assays may also be used to identify specific organisms and the input of an expert microbiologist should be sought.

# 13 **What are the principles of treating infective endocarditis for the most common bacteria?**

- The aim of treatment of IE is to eradicate infecting organisms using bactericidal drugs, with the possible adjunctive treatment of surgery to remove infected matter.
- Microorganisms within vegetations are protected from the host's defences and therefore bacteriostatic drugs are of little benefit in IE.
- Ideally, antimicrobial therapy is chosen based on organisms cultured and characterised from blood or infected material.
- Until a responsible microorganism is identified, antimicrobial therapy is directed at the most likely infecting organisms. Local microbiology expertise should be sought.
- Streptococcal endocarditis is treated with penicillin G, ampicillin or ceftriaxone for 6 weeks, or ampicillin with gentamicin for 2 weeks in uncomplicated cases. Vancomycin is used in beta-lactam allergic patients. Vancomycin may also be preferred in penicillin-resistant cases.
- Staphylococcal endocarditis is treated with flucloxacillin or cotrimoxazole with clindamycin for 6 weeks. For penicillin-allergic patients or methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin or daptomycin for weeks is recommended.
- båíÉêçÅçÅÅìë species are resistant to microbicidal effects of antibiotics, and require prolonged courses of at least 6 weeks of

- therapy with synergistic bactericidal combinations, such as ampicillin and ceftriaxone or vancomycin and gentamicin.
- In prosthetic valve endocarditis, vancomycin for 6 or more weeks and gentamicin for 2 weeks is used. Rifampicin is used in addition for the treatment of infected prosthetic valves or other prosthetic material, as it is able to penetrate the biofilm of most of the pathogens that infect devices.
- Fungal IE often requires surgical removal and replacement of infected prosthetic material, in addition to prolonged antifungal therapy. Long-term or lifelong treatment with oral antifungal agents is often recommended.
- Suggested empirical antibiotic regimes for early treatment of IE before identification of the responsible microbes which may be used in acutely ill patients include:
  - a) community-acquired native valve IE or late prosthetic valve IE:
    - i) ampicillin with flucloxacillin and gentamicin; or
    - ii) vancomycin with gentamicin for penicillin-allergic patients;
  - b) early prosthetic valve IE or nosocomial and non-nosocomial healthcare-associated IE:
    - i) vancomycin with gentamicin and rifampicin.

# 14 **What are the indications for surgery in <sup>a</sup> patient with infective endocarditis?**

- Surgery may be required in around 50% of patients with IE. Surgery performed early, while the patient is still receiving antimicrobial therapy carries a high risk of mortality and therefore is usually reserved for patients with severe complications or the risk of severe complications.
- The European Society of Cardiology and the European Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery Guidelines (Table 2) suggest that surgery in the active phase of IE should be considered for:
  - a) uncontrolled heart failure despite appropriate medical management. Heart failure may occur acutely secondary to acute severe aortic or mitral regurgitation caused by chordal rupture, flail leaflet, perforation of the valve leaflet or the physical effect of a vegetation preventing valve coaptation;
  - b) uncontrolled infection despite adequate antimicrobial therapy, defined as:
    - i) persisting infection, with positive blood cultures after 7- 10 days of appropriate antibiotic therapy, if extracardiac

- a Emergency surgery: surgery performed within 24 h; urgent surgery: within a few days; elective surgery: after at least weeks of antibiotic therapy.
- b Class of recommendation.
- c Level of evidence.
- d Surgery may be preferred if a procedure preserving the native valve is feasible.

- abscesses have been excluded. Some evidence now exists that blood cultures remaining positive after hours of antibiotics is associated with poor prognosis and surgery could be considered at 3 days;
- ii) paravalvular extension (including abscess formation, pseudoaneurysm formation or fistulae) is particularly common with aortic valve IE or prosthetic valve IE, as well as in cases with pí~éÜK ~ìêÉìë as the infecting organism. Paravalvular extension is associated with a high mortality;
- c) prevention of systemic or pulmonary embolism. Left-sided vegetations commonly embolise to the brain or spleen, whereas right-sided vegetations (including those from pacemaker leads) commonly embolise to the lungs. Embolic events typically occur in the first few days after starting antibiotic therapy and are relatively rare after 2 weeks of therapy. There is a higher risk of embolisation in the presence of:
  - i) large vegetation (>10mm for left-sided IE, >20mm for right-sided IE) (Figure 1);

**Figure 1. A) A large staphylococcal vegetation (black arrow) seen in the left ventricular outflow tract in a 16-year-old boy with no known cardiac anomaly. B) An operative specimen following surgical resection of the vegetation.**

- ii) mobile vegetation seen on echocardiography;
- iii) previous embolic event;
- iv) underlying atrial fibrillation;
- v) pí~éÜK ~ìêÉìë as the infecting organism.

# 15 **What are the principles of surgery for infective endocarditis?**

- The decision to operate is individualised, with factors such as size and mobility of the vegetation, previous embolism, type of microorganism and duration of antibiotic therapy taken into account.
- A multidisciplinary team including a cardiothoracic surgeon, a cardiologist and a microbiologist should be involved in the decisionmaking process.
- The aims of surgery include:
  - a) total removal of the vegetations and all infected material, in order to reduce the risk of recurrent infections and failure of the repair;
  - b) reconstruction of the cardiac structures.
- If there is an anatomical cardiac defect, such as a ventricular septal defect or patent ductus arteriosus, it should be addressed when the infection is controlled or at the time of vegetectomy.

**Figure 2. Operative images demonstrating: A) a large vegetation (black arrow) deep within the right ventricular cavity below a small untreated ventricular septal defect; and B) the excised vegetation. APM = anterior papillary muscle; CS = coronary sinus.**

- Repair of any involved valves should be performed when possible, especially in very young patients, to avoid implanting a small prosthetic valve.
- Surgical repair is often established on the basis of the intra-operative findings and the conditions of the heart once removal of the infected tissue is complete.
- In some cases, removal of the vegetation is sufficient (Figure 2).
- Both autologous tissues and heterologous tissues can be used for repair of valves and blood vessels (Figure 3).

**Figure 3. Operative images demonstrating: A) a large vegetation seen on the anterior leaflet (AL) of the tricuspid valve (black arrow) and seeding vegetations on the septal leaflet (SL); B) complete excision of the vegetation and involved leaflet tissue, including the commissural subvalvular apparatus (white asterisk); C) closure of the ventricular septal defect, reconstruction of the valve with autologous pericardium and resuspension of the commissure with artificial chordae; and D) a competent valve on saline static testing.**

- When valve replacement is unavoidable, both tissue and mechanical prostheses can be used, without a substantial difference in the rate of recurrent infection.
- In cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis, the valve is removed and the annulus cleared of infection prior to the reimplantation of a new prosthesis (Figure 4).

## 16 **What are the outcomes of surgery for infective endocarditis?**

- Although improvements in diagnosis, advances in antibiotic therapy and aggressive treatment of IE have improved survival, mortality remains substantial (10-25%).
- Peri-operative mortality of patients undergoing IE surgery depends on comorbidities, degree of left ventricular impairment, infective agent, extent of destruction of cardiac structures and anatomical defects.

- No pre-operative risk score currently in use has been validated for the assessment of the operative risk in patients with IE.
- Operative mortality is 5-15% for patients with native valve IE. If surgery is performed early in the disease process (first week of antibiotic therapy), in-hospital mortality is 15%. The in-hospital mortality in patients with prosthetic valve IE is 20-40%.
- The cause of death may be intractable sepsis or multi-organ failure and is often multifactorial.
- Long-term survival is 60-90% at 10 years for native heart endocarditis and slightly less for prosthetic valve cases at 50-70%.
- The risk of recurrence (relapse or reinfection) is 2-6% amongst survivors.

# 17 **What are the principles of prophylaxis for infective endocarditis?**

- The American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology both recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with the highest risk of developing infective endocarditis undergoing highrisk procedures.
- High-risk patients include those with:
  - a) prosthetic valve or prosthetic material used for cardiac valve repair, including transcatheter deployed valves;
  - b) previous episode of infective endocarditis;
  - c) congenital heart disease, including:
    - i) any type of cyanotic lesion;
    - ii) any congenital lesion repaired with prosthetic material, placed surgically or percutaneously, up to 6 months after the procedure (until endothelialisation occurs) or lifelong if a residual shunt or valve regurgitation remains.
- High-risk procedures include dental procedures that involve manipulation of gingival tissue, periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa, including scaling and root canal work.
- Antibiotic prophylaxis, however, is no longer recommended for:
  - a) procedures involving incision of the respiratory mucosa;
  - b) gastrointestinal or urogenital procedures;
  - c) transoesophageal echocardiography;
  - d) skin and soft tissue procedures, including tattooing and piercing.

- Antibiotic therapy is advised when invasive procedures are performed in the context of active infection.
- Education of patients regarding the prevention and recognition of IE is the most effective prophylaxis, either after the first episode in patients with structurally normal hearts and as primary prevention in patients with congenital heart disease, prosthetic valves or intravascular devices.
- Patients should be advised regarding the importance of good dental hygiene, regular dental check-ups, avoidance of tattoos and body piercings, as well as recognition of the signs and symptoms of IE, and avoidance of self-medication with antibiotics.

### 18 **Describe the antibiotic prophylaxis regimes used for patients with prosthetic cardiac valves used prior to a dental procedure**

- The main target of oral antibiotic prophylaxis in high-risk patients before dental procedures is oral píêÉéíçÅçÅÅìë species, with suggested antibiotic regimes described in Table 3.
- Instead of ampicillin, alternative cephalosporins can be used, including:
  - a) cephalexin 2g IV (adults) or 50mg/kg IV (children);
  - b) cefazolin or ceftriaxone 1g IV (adults) or 50mg/kg IV (children).
