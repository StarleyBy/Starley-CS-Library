# Atrioventricular septal defects

**Christopher E. Mascio**

- 1 **What is an atrioventricular septal defect?**
- Atrioventricular septal defects (AVSD) represent a spectrum of endocardial cushion defects (Figure 1) defined by a variable absence of the atrioventricular septum, including:
  - a) complete AVSD which comprises a primum atrial septal defect (ASD) and an inlet ventricular septal defect (VSD). There is a common atrioventricular (AV) valve (not distinct mitral and tricuspid valves), with left and right components and superior and inferior portions that 'bridge' the crest of the VSD;
  - b) intermediate AVSD which is comprised of a primum ASD and inlet VSD but has two atrioventricular valve orifices;
  - c) transitional AVSD which is comprised of a primum ASD and a restrictive VSD. There is commonly a cleft in the left AV valve;
  - d) partial AVSD which is comprised of a primum ASD and usually a cleft in the left AV valve.
- AVSD comprises 3% of all congenital heart defects.

#### 2 **Describe the classification of complete atrioventricular septal defects**

- Complete AVSD have been subclassified by Rastelli (Figure 2):
  - a) Type A (most common subtype, 75%) where the superior bridging leaflet is divided over the crest of the ventricular septum and contains chordal attachments to the crest of the ventricular septum;
  - b) Type B (rarest subtype) which has straddling chordal attachments and is commonly seen in an unbalanced AVSD;
  - c) Type C (25%) which has an undivided superior bridging leaflet and no chordal attachments to the crest of the ventricular septum. This subtype is commonly seen in patients with AVSD associated with tetralogy of Fallot.

# 3 **What is the embryology of an atrioventricular septal defect?**

• After looping of the cardiac tube, septation and formation of the AV valves occurs, with the endocardial cushions located at the crux of the heart. Failure of proper endocardial cushion growth into the posterior atrium results in a primum ASD.

- Abnormalities of growth toward the ventricular apex result in an inlet VSD, located under what normally would be the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve.
- The endocardial cushions also grow to the left and right to form the AV valves. Abnormal AV valve formation results in a common AV valve with left and right components and superior and inferior portions that bridge the ventricular septum.

# 4 **Describe the anatomical features of an atrioventricular septal defect**

- Although a primum defect is the commonest type of ASD found in AVSD, a patent foramen ovale (PFO) or secundum ASD is also often present.
- As regards the type of VSD, it is usually an inlet defect, which is commonly very large in complete AVSD defects.
- As the conduction system is located posteriorly and inferiorly near the crest of the ventricular septum, it is important when closing the VSD that care is taken to place sutures on the right ventricular side of the septum in this area.
- It is also important when closing the ASD to avoid the conduction system near the coronary sinus (Figure 3). In this area, sutures should be placed in the mouth of the coronary sinus and/or slightly leftward of the atrial septum. Alternatively, the coronary sinus can be closed to the left atrium to ensure the conduction system is avoided.
- The LVOT in an AVSD is described as a 'gooseneck' (Figure 4). Although intervention on the LVOT is not common during repair in infancy, the LVOT requires long-term echocardiographic evaluation to screen for subaortic obstruction.
- The left AV valve commonly has a cleft that runs perpendicular to the ventricular septum. Cleft closure is recommended, when possible, to avoid left AV valve regurgitation. This can develop when the heart is septated, even if not present pre-operatively. Care should be taken to not 'purse-string' the suture when closing the cleft. An interrupted technique may prevent purse-stringing and foreshortening of the leaflets.
- While all components of AVSD repair are important, reintervention is most common for left AV valve regurgitation and/or stenosis. When deciding how to best septate the superior and inferior bridging leaflets, it is critical to assign the proper amount of leaflet tissue to each side. And, sometimes it is prudent to septate in such a way that assigns slightly more leaflet tissue to the left side.
- A deficient or poorly formed mural leaflet is a risk factor for left AV valve regurgitation.

**Figure 4. A) Echocardiographic and B) angiographic images of a patient with an atrioventricular septal defect demonstrating the typical 'gooseneck' deformity of the left ventricular outflow tract.**

- Left AV valve abnormalities in AVSD include a parachute type of left AV valve with a single LV papillary muscle, rotated papillary muscles and double-orifice left AV valve.
- In patients with a double-orifice left AV valve, the bridging tissue between the two orifices should not be divided during repair, as this will cause significant left AV valve regurgitation.
- Unbalanced AVSD refers to the morphology of the ventricle over which the AV valve predominantly empties (Figure 5). Unbalanced to the right means the right ventricle is large and the left ventricle is underdeveloped. Unbalanced AVSD occurs along a spectrum. Some unbalanced AVSD can be septated while others are palliated with a single-ventricle approach. When the AVSD is unbalanced to the right and septated, the left AV valve cleft is sometimes left open to prevent left AV valve stenosis. Balanced AVSD can be safely septated.

- 5 **What anomalies are associated with atrioventricular septal defects?**
- Tetralogy of Fallot. If a transannular patch is necessary for repair of the tetralogy of Fallot component, any subsequent pulmonary

- regurgitation can be problematic if the right AV valve has significant insufficiency after repair of the AVSD component.
- Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO). The apically displaced common hinge point of the AV valves creates an elongated LVOT that resembles a 'gooseneck'. Abnormal chordal attachments from the left AV valve to the ventricular septum increases the risk of LVOTO occurring.
- Down's syndrome. The majority (70-80%) of patients with complete AVSD have Down's syndrome, whereas 10% of patients with partial AVSD have Down's syndrome. Overall, 50% of all children with Down's syndrome have a complete AVSD. It is not clearly understood why patients with Down's syndrome rarely develop left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
- Double-orifice left AV valve. This is rarely seen and is usually in the inferior bridging leaflet. The smaller orifice is usually not addressed at the time of repair, as creating a single orifice may cause significant left AV valve insufficiency.
- Additional ventricular septal defects can be present in any location.
- Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is seen in approximately 10% of patients with AVSD and is more common in those with a VSD.
- Double-outlet right ventricle (DORV) and transposition of the great arteries (TGA) occur rarely with AVSD.

#### 6 **What is the pathophysiology of an atrioventricular septal defect?**

- The anatomy of an AVSD results in left-to-right shunting.
- Complete AVSD have a non-restrictive VSD and single or multiple ASD.
- Partial AVSD have a similar pathophysiology to that of a simple ASD, with the shunting dependent on the size of the defect and the compliance of the ventricles.
- Transitional AVSD have a restrictive VSD.
- In all subtypes, the amount of shunting is dependent on the pulmonary vascular resistance. As the PVR decreases over the first month of life, the left-to-right shunt increases.
- The left-to-right shunting at the atrial level (partial and most intermediate types) will cause mainly pulmonary volume overload, with consequent dilatation of the right-sided chambers. Over time, the dilatation will cause suboptimal coaptation of the leaflets of the left and right AV valves and subsequent AV valve insufficiency.
- In complete AVSD, shunting occurs at both the atrial and ventricular level, resulting in the pulmonary circulation burdened with volume

- and pressure overload, as well as left-sided chamber dilatation. This can lead to congestive heart failure within the first few months of life.
- Irreversible pulmonary vascular changes can be seen as early as 6 months of age and is accelerated in patients with Down's syndrome.
- Patients with Down's syndrome have an anatomical predisposition to recurrent respiratory infections and the development of pulmonary vascular occlusive disease, increased bronchial secretions, decreased number of distal bronchi, and a thick tongue that can contribute to airway obstruction, tracheobronchomalacia and CO2 retention.
- In untreated patients with AVSD, Eisenmenger's complex will eventually develop as the pulmonary vascular disease progresses. The shunt will become right-to-left and the patient will become cyanotic.

# 7 **What is the natural history of an atrioventricular septal defect?**

- Many patients (80%) with an untreated complete AVSD can survive into the second and third decades of life without operative correction. Survival beyond the third or fourth decade is rare.
- The natural history of a partial or intermediate AVSD is similar to that of a simple ASD and depends on the degree of any residual left AV regurgitation.
- Heart failure and recurrent respiratory infections cause the majority of early mortality, whereas pulmonary vascular disease accounts for the majority of late mortality.

#### 8 **What are the symptoms of an atrioventricular septal defect?**

- Patients with a complete AVSD become symptomatic when the pulmonary vascular resistance decreases causing an increase in pulmonary blood flow. This usually occurs after the first few weeks of life. The common symptoms are poor feeding, tachypnoea, diaphoresis and weight loss.
- Patients with significant left AV valve regurgitation and/or LVOTO usually have a more dramatic presentation.
- Patients with a partial AVSD with minimal AV valve regurgitation will be asymptomatic, similar to patients with a simple secundum ASD.
- Although patients with AVSD and associated tetralogy of Fallot may remain balanced with respect to pulmonary and systemic blood flow, they may also develop right-to-left shunting across the VSD and

cyanosis, if severe right ventricular outflow tract obstruction is present.

# 9 **What are the signs of an atrioventricular septal defect?**

- The presence of a VSD in complete AVSD results in a harsh, holosystolic murmur, audible at the left sternal border. P2 is loud and there is fixed splitting of the 2nd heart sound.
- A systolic pulmonary flow murmur and a fixed, widely split 2nd heart sound is found in patients with a partial AVSD, similar to patients with a secundum ASD.

# 10 **What are the electrocardiographic features of an atrioventricular septal defect?**

- In AVSD, the bundle of His is displaced inferiorly, resulting in left axis deviation (Figure 6).
- Right ventricular hypertrophy is commonly present.
- The PR interval is occasionally prolonged.

#### 11 **What are the chest radiographic features of an atrioventricular septal defect?**

• The chest radiograph will demonstrate an enlarged cardiac silhouette and increased pulmonary vascular markings (Figure 7).

![](_page_8_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 7. Chest radiograph of a patient with an atrioventricular septal defect demonstrating cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings.**

• In patients with significant left AV valve regurgitation, an enlarged left atrium can elevate the left mainstem bronchus.

# 12 **What are the echocardiographic features of an atrioventricular septal defect?**

- Echocardiography is diagnostic and should include a thorough evaluation of the following:
  - a) size of the ASD and VSD (Figure 8);
  - b) presence or absence of an additional VSD;
  - c) degree of AV valve regurgitation;
  - d) balance of the valves and ventricular cavities;
  - e) evaluation for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO);
  - f) presence or absence of:
    - i) double-orifice left AV valve;
    - ii) tetralogy of Fallot;
    - iii) double-outlet right ventricle (DORV);
    - iv) transposition of the great arteries (TGA);
    - v) patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).

• If AV valve regurgitation is present, the mechanism of the regurgitation should be elucidated. Three-dimensional echocardiography can be useful in this situation (Figure 9).

#### 13 **Describe the role of cardiac catheterisation and magnetic resonance imaging in the management of a patient with an atrioventricular septal defect**

- Cardiac catheterisation is not routinely used for pre-operative evaluation, except in older patients with AVSD, where calculation of pulmonary vascular resistance helps to determine the operative risk and better counsel both the family and congenital heart team.
- Postoperatively, cardiac catheterisation is used to identify and quantify any residual lesions that could require reoperation, such as LVOTO or VSD.
- Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to assess the presence of any postoperative residual LVOTO (Figure 10).

# 14 **What are the principles of managing <sup>a</sup> patient with an atrioventricular septal defect?**

- The diagnosis of an AVSD is an indication for surgical repair.
- A complete AVSD can routinely and safely be repaired with good results as early as 2 months of age. Waiting until 8 months and beyond risks the development of obstructive pulmonary vascular disease.
- Surgery for partial or transitional AVSD can be performed after the age of 1 year, as the pulmonary circulation is protected and there is minimal risk of developing pulmonary vascular disease.

#### 15 **What is the surgical approach for repair of an atrioventricular septal defect?**

- Partial or complete median sternotomy is the standard approach for patients with a complete and transitional AVSD.
- For patients with a partial AVSD, some groups have advocated a submammary right anterior thoracotomy as an alternative approach to sternotomy.
- As standard, the patient is placed on cardiopulmonary bypass using bicaval cannulation, aortic cross-clamping and administration of cardioplegia.

# 16 **What are the principles of surgery for <sup>a</sup> patient with an atrioventricular septal defect?**

- The primary goal is complete repair, which should include:
  - a) closure of all intracardiac and extracardiac shunts, including the ASD, VSD and, when present, PDA;
  - b) obtaining two competent and non-stenotic AV valves;
  - c) treating any potential for LVOT obstruction;
  - d) avoiding lesions to the conduction system.
- The interatrial communication can be closed leaving the coronary sinus to the right or left side of the patch, thereby allowing it to drain into the right or left atrium, respectively.
- Although associated anomalies should be treated at the time of repair, these can become exceptionally difficult operations to perform.
- Palliation of an AVSD by pulmonary artery banding (PAB) is rarely performed due to the tendency to develop left AV valve regurgitation. It is usually only considered when severe comorbidities prevent the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, such as the presence of an intracranial bleed or ongoing sepsis.

# 17 **What are the surgical options for repair of <sup>a</sup> complete atrioventricular septal defect (Figure 11)?**

- Double patch technique which involves using one patch to close the VSD and a second patch to close the ASD:
  - a) the VSD repair is performed using Dacron® or autologous pericardium, with a continuous or interrupted suturing technique;

![](_page_12_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 11. Surgical repair of a complete atrioventricular septal defect, using a: A) single patch technique; B) double patch technique; or C) modified single patch technique. RA = right atrium; LA = left atrium; RV = right ventricle; LV = left ventricle; RAVV = right atrioventricular valve; LAVV = left atrioventricular valve.**

- b) the ASD repair should be performed with autologous pericardium, as the use of synthetic material close to the ASD may result in haemolysis, if any AV valve regurgitant jet is directed at the synthetic patch;
- c) the cleft in the left AV valve should be closed to prevent later development of significant AV valve regurgitation. This is usually done after VSD repair but before ASD repair. An interrupted or continuous suturing technique can be used for cleft closure but care should be taken to not purse-string the cleft repair;
- d) Prior to closing the right atrium, the right AV valve should be evaluated for significant regurgitation and corrected if present.
- Single patch technique which involves one large autologous pericardial patch:
  - a) the superior and inferior bridging leaflets are incised over the crest of the septum;
  - b) the pericardial patch is initially sutured to the crest of the ventricular septum, with care taken to place sutures slightly

- more rightward along the posteroinferior border to avoid the conduction tissue;
- c) the divided AV valves are resuspended to an appropriate level on the pericardial patch;
- d) the cleft in the left AV valve is then closed;
- e) the remaining pericardial patch is used for ASD repair.
- Modified single patch technique ('Nunn procedure') which involves primary closure of the VSD by suturing the AV valve tissue directly to the crest of the ventricular septum. Pledgeted sutures are passed through the septum, AV valve tissue and finally the autologous pericardial patch. The sutures are then tied to bring the AV valve tissue and patch down to the level of the ventricular septum. The cleft is then closed and the remaining patch is used to close the ASD.
- 18 **What are the principles of surgery for <sup>a</sup> partial atrioventricular septal defect (Figure 12)?**
- Repair of the left AV valve cleft.
- Closure of the ASD with a patch of autologous pericardium.

#### 19 **What are the principles of surgery for <sup>a</sup> transitional atrioventricular septal defect (Figure 13)?**

- Closure of the small, restrictive VSD, which is usually near the cleft and can be closed with one or two pledgeted sutures.
- Closure of the left AV valve cleft.
- Repair of the ASD using autologous pericardium.

#### 20 **What are the principles of echocardiographic assessment following atrioventricular septal defect repair (Figure 14)?**

- The important features of the postoperative echocardiogram after AVSD repair include evaluation of:
  - a) biventricular function;
  - b) both AV valves for stenosis or regurgitation;
  - c) residual shunts (ASD, VSD and LV to RA);
  - d) LVOT for stenosis.

# 21 **What are the most common complications following repair of an atrioventricular septal defect?**

- Heart block which can be minimised by suturing the VSD patch on the right side of the crest of the septum at the posteroinferior border. Closing the coronary sinus into the left atrium may also decrease the risk of postoperative heart block.
- Residual ASD or VSD which should be identified by intra-operative echocardiographic assessment and a saturation run (from the SVC, IVC and pulmonary artery) that can help to quantify the degree of shunting, using the formulae:

Qp: Qs = Aortic saturations – Mixed venous saturations Pulmonary vein saturations – Pulmonary artery saturations

Mixed venous saturations = 
$$\underbrace{(3 \times SVC \text{ saturations} + 1 \times IVC \text{ saturations})}_{4}$$

In the postoperative period, patients that fail to wean from the ventilator, have continued/worsening cardiomegaly or require significant anti-congestive medical therapy should be evaluated for residual shunts. A large residual VSD is more likely to cause a problem than a residual ASD. Cardiac catheterisation is often necessary to characterise the severity of the shunt.

• Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) — which is usually caused by accessory chordal attachments to the septum that require division. In some cases, the anomalous position or attachment of the

- left portion of the superior bridging leaflet can cause LVOTO or occasionally a recurrent subaortic membrane.
- AV valve regurgitation which will require reoperation in up to 15% of patients that undergo repair of AVSD. Risk factors include doubleorifice left AV valve, absence of Down's syndrome and significant pre-operative left AV valve regurgitation.

# 22 **What are the strategies for treating left atrioventricular valve regurgitation or stenosis?**

- The left AV valve is the most common reason for reoperation after repair of the AV canal, with regurgitation more common than stenosis.
- The previous cleft closure frequently breaks down and reclosure of the cleft is a strategy that reduces regurgitation in many cases.
- When the regurgitation is due to a deficient mural leaflet or annular dilation, the repair is more complex and unlikely to be durable.
- Various techniques of annuloplasty at the commissures is sometimes helpful, along with valvuloplasty of the leaflets. Leaflet extension using autologous pericardium or other commercially available patches can reduce regurgitation in some cases.
- Commercially available annuloplasty rings, however, are too large for the smaller patients, as well as the concern that using annuloplasty rings or other circumferential techniques restrict growth potential.
- Left AV valve stenosis is a challenging problem. One strategy involves taking down part of the cleft repair, but this risks increasing the regurgitation.
- Splitting the papillary muscle and other parts of the subvalvar apparatus may be helpful in some cases of patients with a single left AV valve papillary muscle.
- Valve replacement is a last resort in children, with the smallest mechanical prosthesis available being 15mm. There is a real risk of heart block and coronary artery injury. In addition, the children will outgrow these small prostheses necessitating re-replacement.

# 23 **What are the long-term outcomes of surgery for an atrioventricular septal defect?**

- Early mortality for repair of complete AVSD is 2-5% in single institution studies. The recent Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database analysis reported an operative mortality for complete AVSD of 2.2%.
- The most common reasons for reoperation are left AV valve dysfunction and LVOT obstruction. For these reasons, AVSD patients require lifelong follow-up.

- Reoperation on older children or adults with AVSD can be challenging as patch material used in previous repairs is often calcified, which does not permit suture placement for valve repair or replacement. This can necessitate taking down previous patch material.
- Unbalanced AVSD patients that undergo single-ventricle palliation are subject to the same long-term complications of other Fontan patients, including but not limited to protein-losing enteropathy, plastic bronchitis, liver dysfunction/cirrhosis, and diminished ventricular function. This population is often referred for heart or combined heart/liver transplantation.
