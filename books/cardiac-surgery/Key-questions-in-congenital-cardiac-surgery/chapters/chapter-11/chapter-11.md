### Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation

**Spiros Loggos, Attilio A. Lotto**

### 1 **What is extracorporeal life support?**

- Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is a general term used to describe any form of extracorporeal support to the heart and/or lungs, when they are failing and not responsive to conventional treatments, and includes:
  - a) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO);
  - b) ventricular assist devices (VAD);
  - c) cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).

### 2 **What is extracorporeal membrane oxygenation?**

- Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an extracorporeal life support circulation (ECLS) technique, utilised to provide cardiac, respiratory or combined support to patients, whose lungs are unable to provide an adequate gas exchange to sustain life, and/or to patients whose heart is unable to sustain adequate cardiac output.
- The circuit involves draining blood from the venous circulation, pumping it through an oxygenator, where oxygen (O2) is added and carbon dioxide (CO2) is removed, and then returning the oxygenated blood back to the patient with an adequate pressure, to either the venous or arterial circulation, depending on the mode of cannulation used.

### 3 **Describe the history of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation**

- ECMO as we intend it nowadays has evolved significantly and has expanded its indications to a larger group of patients.
- The first prolonged extracorporeal support was reported by Hill and colleagues in 1972, and historically, was developed for adult patients with acute respiratory failure refractory to conventional mechanical ventilation.

- In 1976, the first successful support for a neonate who was treated for meconium aspiration syndrome and severe respiratory failure was reported by Robert Bartlett. She was supported on ECMO for 3 days and recovered fully.
- Subsequently, it has been employed in younger patients and also in patients with post-cardiotomy heart failure, unable to wean from CPB following a cardiac operation.
- In the current era, most cardiac units worldwide are able to provide ECMO support. Several technical advances have made ECMO use safer and easier, with new membrane oxygenators, cannulae and the introduction of centrifugal pumps, representing some of the developments.

### 4 **What are the types of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation?**

- Veno-venous (VV) ECMO where blood is drawn with the use of a centrifugal pump from a systemic vein, passed through a membrane oxygenator and returned to the venous system, ideally near the right atrium. It provides respiratory support, as it returns oxygenated blood to the pre-pulmonary circulation and uses the cardiac function to maintain adequate cardiac output.
- Veno-arterial (VA) ECMO where blood is drawn with the use of a centrifugal pump from the venous system passed through a membrane oxygenator and returned to the arterial system with an adequate pressure. It is used for primary cardiac support but also in heart failure secondary to respiratory failure.
- Arteriovenous (AV) ECMO which uses the patient's own arterial pressure or incorporates a pump to drive blood across an oxygenator to partially support the respiratory system by effectively removing CO2.

### 5 **What is ECPR?**

- Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) refers to the rapid deployment of an ECMO circuit to provide circulatory and respiratory support during cardiac arrest, when conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has failed to provide return of spontaneous circulation within the expected time frame.
- Many studies have shown a superiority of ECPR over conventional CPR in improving survival and neurologic outcome.

### 6 **What are the differences between extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and cardiopulmonary bypass (Table 1)?**

- CPB is mainly intended to be used during cardiac operations in theatre and consists of a large machine, which requires considerable priming volume and a larger dose of heparin (300-400 IU/kg), with a desired activated clotting time (ACT) of >400 seconds. It is prone to haemolysis and haemodilution, utilises an arterial filter and its oxygenator can be only used for a relatively short time. Traditionally, it uses a roller pump and has a blood reservoir (except in mini-bypass circuits) and is able to provide a wide range of temperature change.
- ECMO, however, can only be used to perform a limited number of extracardiac procedures and not open heart procedures but is a smaller machine, portable and usable by the patient's bedside, which only requires a small amount of priming volume and smaller doses of heparin (50-100 IU/kg), with a lower desired ACT of seconds. It has limited haemolytic effects and limited haemodilution, no separate arterial filter and its oxygenator can be used for longterm support. It has a centrifugal pump, no reservoir and a limited capability to cool or warm patients.

### 7 **What are the differences between veno-arterial and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation?**

- VA ECMO can be used to support a patient with both respiratory and cardiac failure, maintain higher systemic blood pressures, provide a variable degree of circulatory support but requires venous and arterial cannulation. It provides a high O2 delivery capacity, has a low pulse pressure on full flow, and reduces cardiac workload by reducing preload but it increases the afterload. Coronary perfusion can be affected by ejection of deoxygenated blood; if not appropriately vented it can provoke LV distension, and may cause LV stunning on prolonged use.
- VV ECMO, however, cannot be used to support cardiac failure, does not affect directly systemic blood pressure but only requires venous cannulation (either single or double cannulation). It only provides a moderate O2 delivery capability, does not reduce cardiac workload, the pulse pressure is unaffected but increases O2 delivery to the coronary and pulmonary circulation.

### 8 **What are the components of an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit?**

- A typical VA ECMO circuit is a complex system (Figure 1), composed of:
  - a) arterial and venous cannulae;
  - b) circuit to connect the venous cannula draining from the patient to the centrifugal pump; from the pump to the oxygenator; and from the oxygenator to the arterial cannula;
  - c) magnetically levitating impeller (centrifugal pump) mounted on a rotating magnet device, controlled by a console (Figure 2);
  - d) membrane oxygenator to which both the venous and arterial sides of the circuit are connected (Figure 3);
  - e) heat exchanger for temperature regulation;
  - f) air and O2 mixer (blender) and sweep gas flow regulator to optimise O2 and CO2 gas exchange (Figure 4);
  - g) side ports (pigtails) used for a wide variety of functions, including:
    - i) administration of heparin continuously;
    - ii) pressure monitoring before and after the oxygenator;
    - iii) sampling for blood gas analysis;
    - iv) connecting the venous and arterial sides of the circuit (bridge) to temporarily isolate the patient from the ECMO pump without stopping the flow (Figure 5);

**Figure 1. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (VA ECMO) circuit: with pigtail 1 used for the venous side of the bridge; pigtail 2 used for inlet pressure monitoring and a large air and fluid line; pigtail 3 used for activated clotting time (ACT) measurement and central venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH) access; pigtail 4 used for CVVH return; pigtail 5 used for pre-membrane pressure monitoring and heparin infusion; pigtail 6 used for air removal and addition of volume; pigtail 7 used for post-membrane pressure, gas samples, clotting products (if there is no patient access); and pigtail 8 used for the arterial side of the bridge.**

- v) connecting the circuit to a continuous renal replacement unit (CVVH);
- h) flow sensors.

- 9 **Describe the different types of pump that are used in an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit**
- Semi-occlusive roller pumps are rarely used currently, as they are more traumatic to blood components, especially when used for longer periods.

• They have been replaced by magnetically levitated centrifugal pumps, which are mounted on a rotating magnet driver (Figure 6).

![](_page_8_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Figure 6. Centrifugal propeller.**

- This pump provides less trauma to blood components and can be employed for longer period of times.
- By spinning, a vortex effect is created with low pressure in the apex of the pump removing blood from the patient. The vortex creates a positive pressure at the bottom of the pump, returning blood to the patient.
- Therefore, centrifugal pumps are preload-dependent and afterloadsensitive.
- Given the prolonged use and dependency of the patient's circulation and respiratory function, drivers are always provided with a back-up for quick replacement in case of failure (Figure 7).

### 10 **What are the main factors affecting extracorporeal membrane oxygenation flow?**

- The pump provides a blood flow rate (L/min) delivered at a given amount of revolutions per minute (rpm).
- Factors that can affect the blood flow rate include:
  - a) preload and afterload;
  - b) size of the cannulae;
  - c) size of the cannulated vessels and compliance;
  - d) body surface area (BSA) of the patient;
  - e) haematocrit;
  - f) transmembrane gradient (which represents the pressure gradient across the oxygenator).

### 11 **What is pump cavitation?**

- The pump generates a negative pressure on the patient's venous side, which drives the flow rate, as it provides the inflow into the propeller.
- Past the point of maximal inflow, the negative pressure in the venous system causes the venous vessels or the right atrial wall to temporarily collapse, potentially occluding blood inflow altogether.
- When the pressure in the venous side builds back up again, the pump is able to flow again, which might generate a pulsing blood flow and cavitation of the pump.
- The first intervention to avoid further cavitation is to reduce the pump rpm and therefore the suction effect on the venous return.

- Other manoeuvres that might be needed to maintain pump blood flow include:
  - a) correcting the hypovolaemia status;
  - b) changing the positioning of the patient;
  - c) ensuring that there is no kinking or malposition of the cannula;
  - d) checking for the presence of thrombus or clotting in the circuit;
  - e) increasing the size of the venous cannulae or adding additional venous access for drainage.

### 12 **What is recirculation?**

• Recirculation is a phenomenon that occurs in VV ECMO when a single intra-atrial double-lumen cannula is used, where reinfused oxygenated blood is withdrawn through the venous drainage cannula and therefore does not reach the systemic circulation (Figure 8).

![](_page_10_Picture_10.jpeg)

**Figure 8. Flow within a single VV ECMO double-lumen cannula: A) in the correct position and functioning properly, the cannula draws deoxygenated blood from the inferior vena cava and right atrium, while the outlet lumen ejects fully oxygenated blood towards the tricuspid valve. This increases forward flow with high oxygen saturation across the pulmonary circulation to reach the left atrium; B) recirculation occurring with the arterial output drained from the cannula instead of reaching the right ventricle, resulting in reduced forward flow to the pulmonary valve and reduced oxygen saturation. RA = right atrium; RV = right ventricle.**

- If the patient is dependent on ECMO for oxygenation, recirculation can pose a clinical problem. In this situation, solutions to be considered include:
  - a) changing the position of the cannulae;
  - b) changing the configuration of the cannulae by adding an extra drainage cannula;
  - c) changing the position of the reinfusion cannula;
  - d) decreasing ECMO flow (if possible).

### 13 **What is Harlequin syndrome?**

- Harlequin syndrome represents a phenomenon occurring in VA ECMO, when there is significant residual native cardiac output with impaired native gas exchange.
- In such cases, poorly oxygenated blood ejected from the heart will supply the upper body, whereas the lower body is perfused by oxygenated blood from the arterial cannula of the ECMO circuit, in particular when a femoral cannula is employed.
- Blood returning to the venous drainage is more saturated than expected and may be interpreted as a form of recirculation, but as the blood has already passed through the systemic circulation, it is not considered recirculation.
- Possible solutions to this include:
  - a) increasing the ECMO flow;
  - b) increasing ventilation support (if possible);
  - c) repositioning the arterial cannula more proximally in the aorta (if central cannulation has been used) or adding an additional arterial cannula for the upper body, such as an axillary artery cannula;
  - d) improving left atrial decompression with a left atrial vent or atrial septostomy.

### 14 **Describe the types of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation arterial cannulae that are used**

- ECMO is instituted using specific cannulae that are produced to be site-specific. Most centres use a uniform size to flow ratio, according to the patient's body weight or body surface area (Tables 2 and 3).
- The size and shape of the venous and arterial cannulae vary when used for central or neck cannulation, as compared to peripheral sites, such as the femoral vein (Figures 9 and 10).
- The use of heparin-coated cannulae and heparin-bonded circuits is variable.

**Figure 9. Arterial cannulae used for paediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenators: A) an 8Fr cannula used for central and neck cannulation, with a single orifice at the cannula tip, which is placed in the aortic arch or root of the right brachiocephalic artery; B) a 15Fr cannula used for femoral cannulation, with a multi-orifice tip, that is more effective in the abdominal aorta.**

- Generally, venous cannulae tend to be larger than the arterial cannulae to prevent venous collapse and to accommodate the higher distensibility of the venous vessels.
- In respiratory ECMO, when the VA set is used, the cannulae tend to be of the same size.

• Although single cannulae (double-lumen) are used in VV ECMO, their use in small babies is limited (Figures 11 and 12).

### 15 **Describe the priming solution used for the institution of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation**

- Priming of the entire circuit, oxygenator and pump is performed before cannulating the patient.
- Carbon dioxide is flushed through the circuit to displace atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen, followed by an infusion of a balanced crystalloid prime.
- Albumin is then added to coat the prosthetic surfaces and decrease platelet and fibrinogen adherence.

- Finally, blood is used to displace the crystalloid to prevent haemodilution, especially in small patients, with the ideal haematocrit between 30-40%.
- A blood gas analysis of the priming solution is made before connecting the patient to the circuit, with adjustments of the priming pH and electrolytes frequently required.
- When blood is added to the prime, heparin is added to initiate anticoagulation (100 units of heparin per unit of packed red blood cells), followed by a buffer solution, such as sodium bicarbonate.

### 16 **What are the different cannulation strategies for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation?**

- Central cannulation which is performed via a median sternotomy and usually involves an arterial cannula in the ascending aorta and a right-angled venous cannula in the right atrium. In some cases, an additional cannula is inserted through the left atrial appendage or the right upper pulmonary vein to vent the left atrium. Indications include:
  - a) post-cardiotomy heart failure, refractory to increasing inotropic support;
  - b) post cardiac arrest, refractory to conventional CPR (ECPR).
- Neck cannulation which can be used for:
  - a) VA ECMO where the arterial cannula is placed in the right common carotid artery (RCCA) and advanced to the aortic arch, and the venous cannula is placed in the right internal jugular vein (RIJV) and advanced to the right atrium-IVC junction. It is mostly used in non-post-cardiotomy neonates and infants requiring both cardiac and respiratory support. The right-sided vessels are preferred but in exceptional circumstances the left neck vessels can be used. If this cannulation is employed, it is important to ensure patency of the contralateral arterial and venous vessels;
  - b) VV ECMO where a double-lumen cannula is inserted in the right internal jugular vein and advanced into the right atrium. In neonates and infants, this is performed by open dissection of the vessels. In larger patients, the cannulation can be done percutaneously, using the Seldinger wire technique.
- Femoral cannulation which is used for larger patients, where higher flows are needed both on the venous and/or arterial side. In VA ECMO, the arterial cannula is placed in the femoral artery and the

venous cannula in the femoral vein, preferably on the opposite side. In patients who are supported with ECMO for a prolonged period, the risk of leg ischaemia, distal to the femoral artery cannulation site, can be significant. This can be mitigated by the (Figure 13):

- a) use of a side graft anastomosed on the femoral artery, which is subcutaneously tunnelled and exteriorised 4 to 5cm inferiorly, with a separate incision;
- b) positioning of a retrograde reperfusion catheter (smaller in size to restrict the flow) in the superficial femoral artery, connected to the femoral arterial cannula.

**Figure 13. Strategies to reduce the risk of leg ischaemia during prolonged periods of ECMO, including: A) an arterial cannula inserted into an interposition graft anastomosed to the femoral artery, which prevents occlusion of the artery; and B) a retrograde reperfusion cannula inserted in the superficial femoral artery to provide distal perfusion. FA = femoral artery; FV = femoral vein; SFA = superficial femoral artery.**

• In VV ECMO, if a double-lumen cannula is not used via the right internal jugular vein in larger children, bilateral femoral venous

- cannulation is used, to drain venous blood from one, and infuse oxygenated blood into the other.
- A combination of neck and femoral vein cannulation can be used to improve venous drainage.

### 17 **What are the indications for <sup>a</sup> left heart vent in venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation?**

- Adequate drainage of the right atrium should reduce left ventricular preload, so that even in the absence of significant ejection, the left ventricle should not distend.
- In certain circumstances, however, the left ventricle can distend significantly, even when the pulmonary forward flow is substantially reduced, where a left atrial vent is beneficial, including:
  - a) severe LV dysfunction with a prolonged lack of contraction and ejection — where venting may support recovery by reducing cardiac workload;
  - b) mitral regurgitation where the ejecting ventricles are subject to volume overload;
  - c) cyanotic patients where the pulmonary return may be increased due to arteriovenous collaterals;
  - d) significant ventricular return and lack of adequate interatrial shunting;
  - e) single ventricle circulations where deoxygenated blood, due to mixing, could be ejected into the coronary system, affecting myocardial recovery;
  - f) severe ventricular arrhythmias;
  - g) any situation requiring venting, where percutaneous septal fenestration cannot be obtained.
- These indications are weighted against adding a second inflow line to the venous drainage with a 'Y' connector and the consequent increased risk of air embolisation in the circuit.
- The left atrium can be accessed via the:
  - a) right upper pulmonary vein;
  - b) Waterston's groove;
  - c) left atrial roof;
  - d) let atrial appendage;
  - e) left ventricular apex (uncommon).

### 18 **What are the principles of transitioning <sup>a</sup> patient from cardiopulmonary bypass to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation?**

- Following cardiac surgery with the patient still in the operating theatre, mechanical support should be considered when cardiac function is inadequate despite maximal medical therapy.
- The institution of ECMO, however, should only be considered when the causes of failure are not attributable to residual surgical lesions, in which case these should be addressed first. The decision should be a multidisciplinary team decision, involving the surgeon, anaesthetist, cardiologist and intensivist.
- Once all correctable lesions have been excluded, ECMO may be indicated with:
  - a) severe right or left ventricular failure (normally myocardial stunning), with the inability to separate from CPB;
  - b) rapid haemodynamic deterioration, unresponsive to increasing inotropic and vasopressor support;
  - c) rapid deterioration in respiratory function, unresponsive to conventional ventilation;
  - d) severe pulmonary hypertensive crisis, unresponsive to inhaled nitric oxide;
  - e) cardiac arrest immediately after chest closure, unresponsive to chest reopening and CPR, or responsive but with residual myocardial stunning.
- One of the challenges faced in such conditions is the choice of the transition method from CPB onto ECMO and depends mainly on the haemodynamic and respiratory status of the patient. The options include:
  - a) completely weaning from CPB, administration of protamine with blood products and then controlled transition to ECMO. This is usually used for patients where respiratory failure is the predominant issue;
  - b) immediate (or almost immediate) transition from CPB to ECMO, administering protamine to reach an ACT of approximately 200 seconds. This is usually used for patients who do not separate from CPB.
- Blood loss while on ECMO cannot be saved and reinfused, leading to multiple blood transfusions and ECMO flow instability. In addition, surgical haemostasis is more difficult whilst on ECMO and surgical

manipulation of the heart can impair ECMO flow. A heparin-free run on ECMO for a limited period of time is an acceptable strategy to limit severe blood loss in these circumstances.

### 19 **What are the indications for the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the intensive care unit?**

- According to current national standards, fully operational congenital heart disease surgical units are expected to provide ECMO support for a range of clinical situations, including:
  - a) haemodynamic and/or respiratory support for patients with congenital heart disease following cardiac surgery;
  - b) support for patients with or without structural heart disease, with acute medical cardiac conditions, such as myocarditis, malignant arrhythmias, cardiac arrest or failure of the newborn;
  - c) support for patients with or without structural heart disease with acute medical non-cardiac conditions, such as sepsis;
  - d) respiratory support for patients with respiratory failure.
- There are two main scenarios in which ECMO is initiated and these can present on the basis on any of the above conditions:
  - a) cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation where ECMO is normally instituted due to a failure to re-establish an adequate circulation or to support a stunned heart following the arrest. If after 5 minutes of internal CPR, the heart function has not regained, an ECPR protocol is deployed with central cardiac VA cannulation and initiation of ECMO. In non-surgical patients, cardiac surgical patients in whom established adhesions may delay central cannulation or patients with a significant risk of bleeding, closed massage and VA ECMO via neck cannulation should be considered;
  - b) progressive deterioration of haemodynamic and/or respiratory function despite full medical support — where controlled cannulation and initiation of VA ECMO should be performed, with:
    - i) neck cannulation for non-cardiac surgical patients;
    - ii) central cannulation for cardiac surgical patients, provided there is an acceptable risk of bleeding.
- In the majority of units, paediatric cardiac surgeons provide surgical support for institution of ECMO, including participating in the decision-making process and the provision of surgical cannulation.

- Non-cardiac ECMO cannulation is also provided by general surgeons, interventional cardiologists and cardiac anaesthetists.
- 20 What additional cardiorespiratory support is required for a patient whilst on veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation?
- In general, VA ECMO provides cardiorespiratory support and the need for inotropic, vasopressive and respiratory treatments are reduced.
- After initiation of ECMO, cardiorespiratory medical support is gradually weaned, according to the haemodynamic state of the patient and ECMO flows.
- Whilst adrenaline can be reduced to small doses in the first hour, vasopressors are often still needed in the first few hours following initiation of ECMO support and in some cases, longer. It is required to counteract vasodilatation that non-pulsatile flow induces on organ perfusion, with a non-ejecting heart, especially if concomitant sepsis is present, where severe vasodilatation could be seen after starting ECMO flow.
- Once ECMO flow balance between preload and afterload is achieved, the need for vasopressor and inotropic support is reduced.
- After initiation of ECMO, respiratory support is also reduced but minimal ventilation (on the resting setting) is maintained to guarantee oxygenation of the blood reaching the left heart, which will allow oxygenated blood to perfuse the coronary arteries, in case of heart ejection.
- The circulatory management of respiratory VV ECMO can be quite different from the cardiac support required with VA ECMO in the surgical population.
- Patients with patent BT shunts may require increased flows and the medical support needed to compensate for the resulting left-to-right shunting and reduction in systemic perfusion.
- Patients with a single-ventricle circulation may require more afterload reduction to compensate for desaturation and limited systemic output.
- 21 What are the exclusion criteria for neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support?
- Gestational age <34 weeks.</li>
- Body weight <2kg (limited by venous cannula size).</li>
- Chronic lung disease >15 days on the ventilator.

- Uncontrolled bleeding or coagulopathy.
- Intracranial haemorrhage (Grade III).
- Known non-correctable cardiac lesions before or after cardiac surgery.
- Known non-cardiac congenital anomalies incompatible with life, including chromosomal abnormalities.
- Severe trauma involving the central nervous system.

### 22 What are the indications for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in the paediatric population?

- In infants and older children, the indications for ECMO include:
  - a) post-cardiotomy cardiac failure, including failure to separate from CPB;
  - b) respiratory failure following cardiac surgery;
  - c) acute cardiac failure following:
    - i) intractable arrhythmias;
    - ii) acute myocarditis;
    - iii) pulmonary hypertensive crisis;
    - iv) drugs and medication overdose;
    - v) massive pulmonary embolism;
  - d) cardiac arrest unresponsive to conventional CPR or myocardial stunning post-CPR:
    - pre-operatively, in patients with a correctable cardiac condition;
    - ii) postoperatively, following cardiac surgery;
  - e) end-stage cardiac failure, as a bridge to VAD or transplantation;
  - f) acute rejection of a transplanted heart or lung;
  - g) acute medical conditions with failed escalating medical support, including sepsis or acute anaphylaxis;
  - h) oncology patients or post-bone marrow transplantation, not responding to maximal medical support, with survival potential;
  - i) peri-procedural support for high-risk percutaneous cardiac interventions.

## 23 What are the exclusion criteria for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support in the paediatric population?

 Although exclusion criteria may vary according to institutional protocols developed to account for the local patient population, expertise and resources, general guidelines provided by the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) include:

- a) cardiac conditions, such as:
  - i) unrepairable congenital heart disease;
  - ii) severe aortic regurgitation;
  - iii) unrepaired aortic dissection;
  - iv) severe peripheral vascular disease, in older patients requiring VA ECMO;
  - v) prolonged cardiac arrest >60 minutes;
  - vi) repeated cardiac arrests;
  - vii) failed CPR with evidence of severe multi-organ failure;
  - viii) unwitnessed cardiac arrest;
  - ix) out-of-hospital arrest (in some centres);
- b) respiratory conditions, such as:
  - i) >7-10 days on the ventilator, depending on age;

  - ii) severe metabolic failure (autoimmune disease);
  - iii) oncological diseases of poor prognosis;
  - iv) chromosomal abnormalities;
- f) infective conditions, such as:
  - i) uncontrolled septic shock.

### 24 **Which imaging modalities are used for patients whilst on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation?**

• Chest radiography can be used to confirm the position of cannulae (Figure 14), immediately after cannulation and thereafter at set intervals depending on institutional protocols. It is important to note that cannulae differ slightly in their appearance on the chest radiograph.

![](_page_24_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 14. Chest radiograph in different patients on veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, immediately following: A) central cannulation, with a right-angled venous cannula in the right atrium and a straight arterial cannula in the aorta; and B) neck cannulation, with the venous cannula longer, reaching the RA, and armed until approximately 5cm from the tip, which is not radiopaque.**

- It is often the first line of investigation to assess cannula dislodgment or malposition, and can also identify any kinks or damage.
- It can also be helpful to visualise the endotracheal tube, lung pathology, pleural collections and cardiac shadow.
- Echocardiography is critical to confirm the position of the cannulae, cardiac function, the presence of any atrial communication and the diagnosis of any congenital defect not yet identified (Figure 15).
- Importantly, it is also used to indicate the progression of the patient on ECMO and allows plans to be made for weaning and disconnection from ECMO support.

![](_page_25_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 15. Echocardiographic images demonstrating venous cannula position for: A) veno-veno extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; and B) veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. RA = right atrium.**

- Computed tomography (CT) scanning can be used to investigate the cardiac and respiratory systems, whilst the patient is on ECMO. It is also useful in assessing the central nervous system, if any neurological symptoms are present.
- CT angiography allows visualisation of cardiac structures and the adequacy of surgical repair. In such cases, a brief period of reduced or no ECMO flow can be employed to fill the cardiac structures, while ventilating the patient fully.
- Angiography is occasionally used to visualise anatomy and also to perform cardiac interventions, as required.
- Ultrasound scanning is used to diagnose involvement of the central nervous system and intra-abdominal organs, and Doppler scanning to visualise distal limb perfusion in patients with femoral cannulation.

### 25 **What are the ventilation settings on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation?**

- Whilst on ECMO, full gas exchange in the lung is not required and ventilation is usually adjusted to rest settings.
- This allows for the lungs to be ventilated with lower volumes and pressures, facilitating lung recovery by preventing barotrauma.
- The usual settings of <sup>a</sup> patient on ECMO are FiO2 30%, PEEP 3- 5cm H2O, respiratory rate rpm, tidal volume 5-10mL/kg, with adjustments made according to the patient's requirements.

In patients with cardiac ejection whilst on VA ECMO, it is advisable
to increase the mechanical ventilation settings, given the increased
pulmonary venous return, to allow for adequate coronary perfusion
with oxygenated blood.

### 26 What procedures can be performed whilst on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation?

- Chest drain insertion for pneumothorax, haemothorax or chylothorax.
- Insertion of central lines, arterial lines or a vascular catheter (for haemofiltration).
- Orotracheal intubation.
- Balloon atrial septostomy.
- Diagnostic or interventional cardiac catheterisation.
- Computed tomography scan.
- Transoesophageal and transthoracic echocardiogram.
- Bronchoscopy.
- Abdominal procedures and peritoneal dialysis catheter placement.

# 27 Describe the principles of anticoagulation management whilst on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation

- One major advantage of ECMO compared to CPB is the lower heparin requirement and lower activated clotting time (ACT). The ACT, however, needs to be checked regularly to avoid under- or overheparinisation.
- Generally, an ACT of 250 seconds is required to start ECMO and this is obtained with heparin 100 IU/kg administered just prior to cannulation, depending on local protocols.
- Regular checks are carried out at 15-minute intervals for the first 2 hours, every 30 minutes for the next hour and finally hourly if the ACT is within the desired parameters.
- A heparin infusion is then started at 0.5mL/hr or 10 IU/kg/hr and titrated accordingly, to maintain an ACT of seconds (or seconds, if bleeding is present).
- In the event of a low ACT, the heparin infusion is increased by 0.2mL/hr and the ACT is checked every 15 minutes until stable.
- If a bolus is required, IU/kg is administered in addition to increasing the infusion by 0.2mL/hr and the ACT is rechecked every 15 minutes.

- A higher ACT may be required when:
  - a) increasing clot or fibrin formation is visible within the circuit;
  - b) less than ideal flows are reached;
  - c) during weaning and trial off ECMO.
- A lower ACT may be required in the presence of persistent bleeding, despite optimising clotting factors or after surgical intervention.
- If bleeding is persistent, the heparin infusion can be stopped, and correction of the coagulation status is achieved by administration of platelets, fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate, according to the clotting results.
- Careful management of the circuit with monitoring of clot formation and fibrous strands within the circuit should be performed. The membrane oxygenator is the most vulnerable component of the circuit at risk of clotting. Monitoring of the transmembrane gradient is paramount to prevent sudden clotting of the oxygenator, causing the pump to acutely fail.
- Once bleeding is corrected, the heparin infusion should be restarted, as above.

### 28 **What are the principles of weaning <sup>a</sup> patient from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation?**

- Weaning a patient from ECMO is a complex and difficult procedure, which requires a multidisciplinary team approach. The respiratory, cardiac, renal and general status of the patient need to be taken into consideration before attempting separation from cardiorespiratory support.
- Prior to the commencement of a weaning trial, the following conditions should be evaluated:
  - a) pulmonary function to assess chest mechanics, the presence of any pleural effusions, pneumothorax, pleural effusions, residual lesions and airway problems by chest radiography, and lung compliance by manual ventilation of the patient. Occasional, inhaled nitric oxide may be required to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance;
  - b) cardiac function by serial echocardiography to assess regional and global function, myocardial contractility and ventricular compliance at rest before the weaning process. In cases where ECMO is required for cardiac failure, a more indepth analysis of cardiac function in response to progressive loading might be required before embarking on a full weaning process (i.e. hours before). This is called a 'stress echo'

and it is achieved by temporarily increasing the ACT to 250 seconds, starting conventional ventilation and progressively reducing the flow by 25% decrements until the circulation is stopped for seconds. In cases where a left heart vent is present, it is reasonable to clamp it for the duration of the stress echo which should be kept short (2-3 minutes) to avoid clot formation in the circuit. While the ECMO flows are reducing, an echocardiogram is continuously performed to assess myocardial systolic and diastolic function, global and regional contractility and any valve dysfunction. In our experience, a stress echo provides important information about progression in the recovery of cardiac function and the timing of the ECMO wean;

- c) renal function where alternative strategies should be considered following a successful weaning (peritoneal dialysis, peripheral CVVH), if replacement therapy was used on ECMO via the side ports;
- d) fluid balance increasing oncotic pressure and the use of vasopressor drugs may be required to limit or reverse fluid extravasation as a consequence of the inflammatory response to ECMO;
- e) vascular function with inotropic and vasopressor support, started before an attempt at weaning;
- f) metabolic status with worsening lactic acidosis, unstable glycaemia and evidence of worsening multi-organ failure on ECMO being poor predictors of a successful wean;
- g) neurologic status where head ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging may be required to document intracranial anatomy and functional status;
- h) infective conditions where worsening signs of sepsis prior to weaning is a poor predictor of outcomes.
- The ACT is generally raised to 300 seconds by increasing the heparin infusion, to reduce clot formation in the cannulae and circuit whilst reducing flow.
- The process of weaning requires a gradual reduction of the flow, so that over the course of hours, the ECMO flow is reduced in steps of 25%.
- During the weaning period, blood gas analysis is performed regularly and the ventilation parameters are adjusted accordingly. Systemic lactate levels are taken into account as part of the assessment of systemic perfusion.
- Weaning from the ECMO circuit is completed by clamping the venous line, unclamping the bridge and then clamping the arterial line, following which the child is isolated from the circuit and the heart takes over the systemic perfusion.

- The cannulae are left in place and the ECMO circuit continues to run via the bridge, in case the child fails the weaning trial.
- Every minutes, the cannulae are flushed to avoid blood stagnation and clot formation.
- Signs of early failure of an ECMO weaning trial include:
  - a) poor haemodynamic performance with declining systemic arterial pressure;
  - b) increasing right and/or left atrial pressure;
  - c) poor ventricular function on echocardiogram;
  - d) arrhythmias;
  - e) poor peripheral perfusion with increasing systemic lactate, hypoxia, hypercarbia and acidosis;
  - f) poor oxygenation and high end-tidal CO2.
- In some cases, a 'one-way wean' strategy is adopted, where ECMO will not be reinstituted in the case of early failure. This is a difficult decision that must be taken by the most senior multidisciplinary team and adopted in cases of manifest inadequacy of the native cardiorespiratory system. Given the nature of active withdrawal of care, it is important to involve the parents in the decision-making process.
- If the trial is successful, the patient is decannulated. In patients with central cannulation via a median sternotomy, a policy of 'delayed sternal closure' is employed. In patients with neck decannulation, vessel reconstruction should be attempted but if no reasonable patency is obtained, vessel ligation may be required.
- An ACT is then performed and protamine is administered to reverse heparin to reach an ACT of seconds.

### 29 **What are the outcomes of patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation following paediatric cardiac surgery?**

- In general, survival to hospital discharge following cardiac ECMO is 40-50% and is influenced by several factors:
  - a) time spent on ECMO where increased duration of ECMO support is associated with a lower survival. Beyond an ECMO duration of 7 days, the odds of mortality increase by 12% per every extra day on ECMO;
  - b) pre-operative conditions where low weight, preterm birth, pre-operative necrotising enterocolitis are recognised risk factors for mortality;
  - c) postoperative complications where renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy, neurological impairment, bleeding and developing necrotising enterocolitis whilst on ECMO, all carry higher mortality;

- d) neurological sequelae where longer CPB (>400 minutes) and the use of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest at the cardiac operation, are determinants of an increased risk of a neurological insult, if the patient needs VA ECMO postoperatively.

### 31 **What are the potential complications of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation?**

- As complications of ECMO are common, each patient is likely to develop an ECMO-related complication. Although circuit-related complications are rare, they are significant.
- Complications that occur during cannulation include:
  - a) damage to the cannulating vessels, including dissection;
  - b) haemothorax, pneumothorax (Figure 16);
  - c) haemopericardium and tamponade;
  - d) accidental dislodgement of the cannulae or malposition;
  - e) limb ischaemia, especially in femoral cannulation.
- Complications that occur whilst the child is on ECMO include:
  - a) bleeding (both minor and major);
  - b) thrombus in the circuit (tubing, oxygenator), or haemolysis;

### 32 **Describe the principles of managing emergency extracorporeal membrane oxygenation scenarios**

- Veno-veno ECMO hypoxia:
  - a) check that the pump flow is over two-thirds of the patient's cardiac output;

- b) administer 100% FiO2 from the oxygenator, aiming to achieve a pO2 >150mmHg;
- c) increase pump flow;
- d) increase ventilation;
- e) cool the patient;
- f) administer muscle relaxants;
- g) maintain haemoglobin levels;
- h) add a second access line to reduce the shunt.

### • Veno-veno ECMO hypercarbia:

- a) check that the pump flow is over two-thirds of the patient's cardiac output;
- b) increase the O2 flow to the oxygenator to twice the pump flow rate;
- c) increase the pump flow rate (otherwise consider that recirculation may be occurring);
- d) increase ventilation;
- e) cool the patient;
- f) administer muscle relaxants.

### • Veno-veno ECMO shunting or recirculation:

- a) observe the cannula position as pump flow may not improve oxygenation;
- b) check that the pre-membrane (venous) pO2 is <50mmHg;
- c) reposition the cannula (if required).

### • Veno-arterial ECMO hypoxaemia:

- a) check the arterial blood gas from the right radial arterial line and O2 saturation measured on the right hand or forehead;
- b) ensure proper functioning of the oxygenator return line pO2 >150mmHg;
- c) increase the pump flow as high as possible;
- d) increase ventilation, PEEP and inspired O2 concentration;
- e) readjust or replace the arterial line, if required.

### • Veno-arterial ECMO hypercarbia:

- a) check for adequate pump flow (over two-thirds of the patient's cardiac output);
- b) adjust the supply of O2 to the oxygenator, to twice the pump flow rate;

- c) increase the pump flow rate;
- d) increase ventilation;
- e) cool the patient;
- f) administer a muscle relaxant.

### • Veno-arterial ECMO bleeding:

- a) prevention is the primary objective by meticulous haemostasis and monitoring coagulation status (ACT, APTT, FBC, D-dimer, fibrinogen);
- b) maintain an APTT of seconds with a heparin infusion (but can be withheld if the patient is bleeding). Heparin-coated circuits can run for a couple days without heparin;
- c) transfuse platelets, cryoprecipitate, FFP, packed cells as needed;
- d) administer antifibrinolytic agents, such as IV tranexamic acid;
- e) consider surgical exploration.
- Veno-arterial ECMO haemolysis which may be caused by a clot in the circuit or near the cannula orifice, obstruction at the circuit, increased speed of the pump, deranged coagulation cascade or liver dysfunction. Presenting signs include haematuria, hyperkalaemia, renal failure, jaundice (late sign) and shaking of the lines due to changes in pressure (cavitating). Management includes the following:
  - a) monitor haemoglobin, liver function tests, urea & electrolytes and clotting screen;
  - b) replace the volume;
  - c) adjust the pump flow;
  - d) a transoesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) to ensure that the cannulae are not obstructed;
  - e) circuit change, if required.

### • Unable to maintain veno-arterial ECMO flow:

- a) check the position of the cannulae and volume status and improve if possible;
- b) check for any kinking of the lines or cannulae;
- c) blood sample from pre- and post-oxygenator;
- d) perform an echocardiogram and chest radiograph to identify the intracardiac position of the cannulae;
- e) optimise fluid status, preload, afterload and contractility;
- f) decrease the pump speed to reduce the suction on the catheter, followed by increasing the speed to normal as smoothly and quickly as possible;

- g) consider changing faulty components.
- Pump failure:
  - a) call for help from the PICU, surgical and perfusion teams;
  - b) ventilate conventionally to support the respiratory system;
  - c) haemodynamic support with inotropes and vasoconstrictor agents;
  - d) if there is no flow, consider the risk of thrombus formation whilst the ECMO is not working;
  - e) if pump head failure is the cause, use the back-up console, battery and check the wall power;
  - f) if an electrical issue is the cause, clamp the lines and turn off the pump, commence hand cranking and evaluate the integrity of the pump head. Consider changing the pump head, turning the pump to the minimal settings of rpm, remove the clamps, and then gradually increase the rpm. Check for thrombus;
  - g) if pump head failure is the cause, clamp the lines and stop the pump, replace the pump head, turn the pump to the minimal settings of rpm, remove the clamps, and then gradually increase the rpm. Check for thrombus.
- Cardiac arrest on VV ECMO:
  - a) call for help;
  - b) CPR;
  - c) consider and check for reversible causes;
  - d) DC shock if in shockable rhythm.
- Cardiac arrest on VA ECMO. Cardiac arrest has little effect on ECMO support, if flows are maintained:
  - a) call for help;
  - b) DC shock if in shockable rhythm.
- Accidental decannulation. On VV ECMO, it may be accompanied by profound hypoxia, hypovolaemic shock and cardiac arrest, whereas VA ECMO may be accompanied by cardiac arrest and hypovolaemic shock:
  - a) call for help;
  - b) clamp the circuit;
  - c) turn off the pump;
  - d) commence cardiopulmonary resuscitation;

- e) ventilate;
- f) administer volume and cardiovascular support;
- g) prepare for surgical intervention.
- Air in the circuit. Air can find its way through various ports, connections, as well as faults in the circuit and cannulae. The presence of a significant amount of air will compromise ECMO flows and performance:
  - a) clamp the arterial line;
  - b) stop the pump;
  - c) place the patient in a head-down position;
  - d) commence inotropic and ventilatory support, including volume replacement;
  - e) examine possible entry points and call for help, if required.
- Circuit rupture, which is accompanied by massive blood loss, air entry to the circuit, and haemodynamic and respiratory compromise:
  - a) clamp the circuit;
  - b) stop the pump;
  - c) call for help;
  - d) support the cardiovascular and respiratory systems;
  - e) replace volume lost;
  - f) prepare for surgical intervention if required or change all or parts of the circuit.
- Thrombus in the circuit. Although this is the most common complication, meticulous management of anticoagulation can help to reduce the risk. Some small-size thrombi may cause problems with the ECMO support. Thrombi of any size pose a danger when present in the outflow portion of the circuit but less so when in the inlet portion, unless large, as they will end up in the oxygenator. Management involves maintaining an optimal ACT, monitoring the circuit for thrombus, and if required, clean or change the affected component of the circuit

### 35 Describe the steps when commencing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation

- After completing the cannulation process, check the circuit, including the position of the cannulae and the patient, ensuring that the cannulae are secure.
- Open the clamp on the venous line above the bridge.
- Close the clamp on the bridge.
- Open the clamp on the arterial line above the bridge.
- Slowly increase the blood flow.
- Monitor the cardiovascular response.
- Wean off the ventilation support.
- Wean off the inotropic support.
- Re-evaluate the circuit for the presence of air bubbles.
- Check all the connections and ports.
- Check that the console, transducers and all other electrical components are operational.
- Perform the calculations regarding flow, sweep, FiO<sub>2</sub>, drug and fluid infusions.
- Check the ACT or APTT and adjust heparin, as appropriate.
- Optimise the clotting profile.
- Inform all personnel involved about the set parameters and alarms.
- Recheck that the cannulae are secure.
- Request an echocardiogram and chest radiograph, as appropriate.

## 36 What are the principles of daily management for a patient requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation?

 Daily routine checks and evaluation of all the organ systems are crucial not only for optimal support but also for survival.

- It is important to regularly check the cannulation site, cannulae and circuit (mechanical and electrical components). Ensure that the position of the patient's head is in the midline, up to 30°.
- Cardiovascular system:
  - a) maintain systemic perfusion and intravascular volume;
  - b) monitor urine output, central venous pressure, physical signs of perfusion, and body weight;
  - c) use echocardiography, as required;
  - d) check the circuit for the presence of clots and overall integrity;
  - e) regular ECG and relevant blood tests.

### • Respiratory system:

- a) ventilation settings;
- b) evaluate arterial blood gases and chest radiograph;
- c) avoid build-up of secretions in the endotracheal tube and pulmonary hygiene with flexible bronchoscopy, as required.

### • Renal system:

- a) in the first 48 hours, there is a high incidence of acute tubular necrosis and oliguria. Thereafter, the urine output usually increases to >2mL/kg/hr;
- b) if renal function does not improve, however, renal support can be added to the circuit with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT);
- c) a renal blood test may be required daily, according to function.

### • Central nervous system (CNS):

- a) avoid paralytic agents;
- b) perform regular sedation holding and neurologic examinations, including pupil size and reaction, reflexes, level of consciousness, and the presence of normal or abnormal movements;
- c) a head US or CT may be required, although CT requires transporting the patient to the radiology department on ECMO.

### • Infection control:

a) all procedures and interventions should follow aseptic techniques;

- b) check all sites for infection;
- c) send appropriate cultures of blood, sputum and urine;
- d) antibiotics, as indicated.
- Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:
  - a) regular monitoring of electrolytes, including magnesium, calcium and phosphorus levels;
  - b) close monitoring of fluid balance, high calorie intake and nutritional support, as required.
- The surgical team should perform daily checks of the cannulation site, cannulae, circuit, assist in dressing changes, be available to transport the patient, and be available to perform any invasive procedure.
