### Adult congenital cardiac intensive care

**Miriam Conway, Susanna Price**

- 1 **Where should critically ill adult congenital heart disease patients be managed?**
- The American Heart Association (AHA) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) advise that adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients are managed in specialist centres where they have access to specific resources and expertise.
- The physiology of the critically ill ACHD patient can be complex and expert input is essential when managing these individuals.
- Where transfer/admission to a specialist centre is precluded due to the clinical status of the patient, expert advice should be sought until transfer is possible, as they may need surgical intervention (for example in endocarditis), but their management prior to transfer may still require ACHD expertise.
- 2 **What are the most common indications for ICU admission in the adult congenital heart disease population?**
- The commonest indication for admission to the ICU is recovery postcardiac surgery.
- Medical acute/emergency admissions are similar to those in acquired cardiac disease, although there are additional indications for admission that reflect the higher incidence of right-sided pathology in this patient population. The most common indications for medical admission to intensive care include:
  - a) arrhythmia/cardiac arrest;
  - b) left ventricular failure;
  - c) endocarditis;
  - d) right ventricular failure;
  - e) haemoptysis;
  - f) syncope.

- 3 **What are the risk factors for increased perioperative mortality and morbidity in the adult congenital heart disease patient population?**
- Patients with complex congenital lesions carry a significantly higher postoperative mortality than those with simple lesions despite having similar APACHE II scores (Figure 1).

Scores are divided into low, fair, moderate, high and extremely high-risk categories. \* = p<0.05.**

• Perioperative mortality is increased in the presence of pre-operative abnormalities, including deranged thyroid function tests, and elevated serum creatinine and bilirubin levels.

#### 4 **What are the main differences between congenital cardiac intensive care and non-congenital cardiac intensive care?**

- The normal physiological status of an ACHD patient is often significantly different from those with acquired cardiac disease.
- The relatively high incidence of right ventricular dysfunction presents a particular challenge, as it is associated with renal and hepatic impairment, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and the need for prolonged respiratory support and intensive care admission.
- Whilst standard management principles do apply to many acutely unwell ACHD patients, certain trends in intensive care management may not be well tolerated by this patient population, including:
  - a) volume resuscitation;
  - b) systemic oxygen delivery;
  - c) sedation;
  - d) use of vasoactive drugs;
  - e) application of positive airway pressure ventilation.
- Considering how supportive and therapeutic interventions may affect the patient, anticipating potential pitfalls is important in every case.

#### 5 **What are the principles in managing <sup>a</sup> critically ill ACHD patient?**

- The first step in assessing a critically ill ACHD patient (as with every critically ill patient) is to know the indication for admission.
- In addition to the standard principles relating to the assessment and management of the critically ill patient, there are a number of additional factors when assessing the ACHD patient that should be considered in turn, including:
  - a) knowledge of the underlying cardiopulmonary anatomy;
  - b) understanding the normal physiology of the patient;
  - c) appreciation of how any supportive or therapeutic interventions may affect the circulation;
  - d) anticipating the potential pitfalls related to critical care monitoring, investigations and interventions.

# 6 What baseline information regarding cardiopulmonary anatomy and function is required when assessing an ACHD patient on arrival in the intensive care unit?

- Primary cardiac lesion(s).
- Surgical or catheter interventions that have been undertaken.
- Any important residual haemodynamic lesions (static or dynamic).
- Optimal intra-operative and postoperative haemodynamics and ventilatory settings for the patient.
- In cases admitted postoperatively, it is additionally important to know whether the surgeon achieved all they had aimed to, or whether there were any unexpected intra-operative challenges.

## What are the minimal baseline investigations for assessment of a critically ill ACHD patient?

- The normal physiological status of the patient may be very abnormal when compared with that of a patient with acquired cardiac disease.
- In this patient population, trying to correct what may be adaptive pathophysiological processes can potentially be harmful.
- It is important to have knowledge of when the patient was last well, and most recent (prior to admission) values of:
  - a) haemoglobin;
  - b) oxygen saturations;
  - c) systemic and pulmonary pressures;
  - d) electrocardiogram (beware in patients with massive atrial enlargement, where atrial tachycardia may mimic sinus tachycardia);
  - e) cardiac function on the most recent echocardiogram or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging scan.
- These should be compared with values obtained on admission to the intensive care. Additional investigations that should be undertaken (depending upon the clinical situation) are:
  - a) plain chest radiograph;
  - b) routine laboratory investigations;
  - c) haematinics (if cyanotic, with automated electronic particle counts);
  - d) coagulation screen (citrate adjusted if erythrocytotic with haematocrit >60);
  - e) pregnancy test (if female of childbearing age);

- f) blood cultures;
- g) serum or faecal alpha-1 antitrypsin (Fontan circulation with ascites).

#### 8 **Describe some of the challenging situations when managing patients with ACHD on the intensive care unit.**

- All ACHD patients have the potential to have very abnormal cardiopulmonary physiology; however, any anatomy that leaves a patient with an effectively univentricular circulation, the presence of systemic-pulmonary shunts, the potential to shunt bidirectionally, and the Fontan circulation are particularly challenging in the critical care setting.
- A number of diagnoses and previous interventions may make blood pressure monitoring inaccurate, including patients with:
  - a) previous or existing classic or modified Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt — where blood pressure will under-read, and the catheter or cuff should be placed on the contralateral arm. With bilateral shunts, lower body blood pressure readings may be more accurate;
  - b) coarctation, previous femoral bypass or multiple cardiac catheterisation — where lower limb pressure may underrepresent the central pressure;
  - c) radial line cannulation or surgical cutdown (especially neonatal) — which may have an ulnar-dominant or absent radial artery. Cuff pressure is usually accurate however, and ulnar cannulation should be avoided.
- Patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease and those with univentricular circulation tolerate hypovolaemia poorly. Assessment of volaemic status is further complicated by coexisting impairment of ventricular function and/or atrioventricular valve regurgitation. Monitoring central venous pressure in patients with Fontan or total cavo-pulmonary connection (TCPC) circulation is not possible.
- The presence of basal crepitations in a patient with pulmonary vein stenosis may not indicate systemic ventricular failure or volume overload but rather pulmonary vein congestion, and hence, should be interpreted with caution.
- Measuring cardiac output in congenital heart disease (particularly where complex) can be challenging. Pulmonary artery catheterisation is not possible in the presence of tricuspid or pulmonary atresia, a

Fontan circulation or TCPC. Furthermore, the presence of intracardiac and extracardiac shunts make pulmonary artery catheter data unreliable. If non-invasive measures are used, the presence of a chronically low cardiac output state and correspondingly small aorta mean that oesophageal Doppler measures may be invalid.

- 9 **What are the differences in pacing in the critically ill ACHD population compared to patients with acquired cardiac disease?**
- When considering the pacing route (transvenous vs. epicardial), certain circulations make traditional transvenous routes impossible, such as tricuspid atresia. In this situation, alternative access must be used (Figure 2) or in an emergency, transcutaneous pacing may be required.
- Where cardiac output is borderline, pacing optimisation using echocardiography can be helpful, although there is little evidence in the literature to date.

**Figure 2. Access for pacing in a patient with tricuspid atresia. A = atrial or proximal pulmonary vein; B = epicardial; C = transaortic access; TA = tricuspid atresia; AoV = aortic valve; RV = rudimentary right ventricle; LV = left ventricle; MV = mitral valve.**

- In patients with restrictive ventricular disease and limited stroke volume, high pacing rates may be required (occasionally up to 120 bpm) in order to maximise cardiac output.
- Although indications for biventricular pacing are in general the same as in acquired cardiac disease, where the patient is critically ill due to limited cardiac output, expert advice should be sought.

#### 10 **What are the main differences regarding respiratory support for a critically ill patient with ACHD and acquired cardiac disease?**

- Associated craniofacial abnormalities seen in some syndromes may complicate both the process of intubation and ventilation, and make non-invasive ventilation impossible.
- Tracheostomy may be complicated due to the presence of collateral blood vessels or abnormal airway anatomy.
- In patients with associated congenital pulmonary disease, there may be a hypoplastic lung or severe V/Q mismatch. Associated pulmonary hypertension may or may not need treating. Comparison with previous investigations is crucial, and interpretation of values must be in the context of right ventricular function.
- Finally, when planning weaning from mechanical ventilation, previous cardiac surgery (possibility of phrenic nerve injury) or associated congenital musculoskeletal deformities must be taken into consideration.

#### 11 **What are the main differences regarding noncardiopulmonary organ dysfunction in a critically ill patient with ACHD and acquired cardiac disease?**

- Associated gastrointestinal anatomical defects are not uncommon, and may include asplenia/polysplenia, GI or renal dysfunction.
- In patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease, associated renal dysfunction is common, and tolerance of intravenous contrast agents may be poor, with a rapid rise in serum potassium seen postprocedure.
- Abnormal liver function tests are common, and may be a reflection of high venous pressure, low cardiac output, or as a result of medication.
- Thyroid dysfunction is common in ACHD patients, and should be managed in the context of critical illness in the standard manner.
- In a patient with severe right ventricular heart dysfunction, low rates of enteral feeding may be required to avoid ileus.

#### 12 **What are the specific considerations in <sup>a</sup> patient being managed postoperatively following coarctation repair?**

- Patients following a coarctation repair are closely monitored for rebound arterial hypertension and mesenteric ischaemia.
- Spinal neurological damage is a rare but a reported complication.
- There is literature discussing the use of cerebrospinal fluid drainage following thoracoabdominal aortic surgery and a reduction in the incidence of neurological injury; however, its role in the ACHD population is unknown.

#### 13 **What are the specific challenges for patients on the intensive care unit following interventional closure of an atrial septal defect?**

- The incidence of arrhythmias, both tachycardia and bradycardia, are high in the immediate post-procedural period. In the more elderly patient population, there may be significant restrictive left ventricular (as well as right ventricular) disease. If the cardiac output remains suboptimal despite pacing, inotrope and volume resuscitation, fenestration should be considered to maintain cardiac output (but at the expense of cyanosis).
- Pre-operative pulmonary hypertension may take time to resolve postprocedure.

#### 14 **What are the principles of managing <sup>a</sup> patient with an atrioventricular septal defect with inadequate cardiac output?**

- Although atrioventricular septal defects (AVSDs) tend to be repaired in childhood, adults do present with partial defects, which can be repaired.
- If the cardiac output is inadequate postoperatively and particularly in the setting of increasing inotropic support, in addition to exclusion of tamponade, left and/or right ventricular failure, arrhythmia and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction should be specifically excluded using echocardiography.

#### 15 **What are the challenges in managing an ACHD patient following surgery for tetralogy of Fallot?**

• Adults with tetralogy of Fallot are most likely to have undergone re-do surgery, although primary repair may be undertaken in a small number of cases.

- Most patients undergoing redo surgery for tetralogy have an uncomplicated postoperative course.
- Severe right ventricular dysfunction pre-operatively should be managed in the usual way.
- In patients who have had either primary repair, or where there has been relief of significant proximal pulmonary artery stenosis, the increase in pulmonary blood flow can significantly increase lung capillary permeability, and acute lung injury can ensue.

#### 16 **What specific considerations or concerns should be addressed following surgery for Ebstein's anomaly?**

- The immediate postoperative care strategy for patients with repair of Ebstein's anomaly is largely driven by their residual right ventricular function.
- In addition, there is a significant incidence of postoperative atrial arrhythmias, and restrictive left as well as right ventricular function.
- Care must be taken to:
  - a) maintain sinus rhythm and optimise pacing using echocardiography;
  - b) avoid elevation in venous pressure;
  - c) avoid over-distension of the right ventricle by excessive fluid administration;
  - d) measure filling pressure and cardiac output with care and when inadequate, take action early;
  - e) maintain normoxia and normocarbia, whilst avoiding aggressive ventilation.
- Worsening liver function tests in such patients are not usually related to a drug reaction but rather an indication of an inadequate cardiac output in the context of a high venous pressure. Where the cardiac output is inadequate, interatrial fenestration may be considered (if not already done) or, alternatively, percutaneous/surgical acute mechanical circulatory support.

#### 17 **What factors should be considered when managing patients with underlying cyanotic heart disease in the intensive care unit?**

• Over years, these patients will have developed adaptive mechanisms to increase oxygenation to tissues, including an increase in cardiac output and haematocrit, and a rightward shift in the oxyhaemaglobin dissociation curve.

- It is not necessary to try to normalise their oxygen saturations to those of non-cyanotic patients, but rather to those they have when well, unless the intervention was intended to restore normoxia.
- Patients are prone to haemostatic abnormalities, and these correlate with the level of erythrocytosis:
  - a) abnormalities of prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, factors V, VII, VIII, IX and thrombocytopaenia have been documented but do not usually need treating;
  - b) citrate bottles adjusted for the haematocrit must be used when measuring the INR.
- Determining the volaemic status and appropriate level of haemoglobin can be challenging, but certain principles apply. These patients are intolerant of hypovolaemia and must be kept well hydrated.
- Whether the transfusion parameters for intensive care are appropriate for these patients is not clear, and although there is little or no evidence in the literature, some intensivists will have a lower threshold for transfusion than in the non-cyanotic patient population.
- Routine venesection is not indicated, and iron deficiency is relatively common.
- In any patient admitted with abnormal neurology, headache or postictal, a high index of suspicion should exist for cerebral abscess or haemorrhage.
- Hyperviscosity and arteriolar vasoconstriction can lead to hypoperfusion of the kidneys and subsequent renal failure. Any investigation that requires intravenous contrast must be performed with the patient well hydrated and using appropriate precautions to prevent further renal injury. Those with significant kidney injury are at risk of developing marked hyperkalaemia following administration of intravenous or intra-arterial contrast media.

#### 18 **What are the principles of managing <sup>a</sup> failing right ventricle on the intensive care unit?**

- When in the subpulmonary position, the failing right ventricle can be supported using standard inotropic agents whilst avoiding pulmonary vasoconstrictors.
- Although no one positive inotropic agent has been shown to be superior to another, there are theoretical benefits in using levosimendan, in terms of its effects on VA coupling.
- Any potentially treatable underlying cause should be addressed, such as volume overload or arrhythmia, including heart rate and pacing optimisation, guided by echocardiography.

• Cardiac output may be maintained or improved by optimising preload and minimising right ventricular afterload (Table 1).

- Pulmonary arterial hypertension, even if only moderate, should be treated if the cardiac output is inadequate in the context of subpulmonary right heart failure. Additional treatment options include:
  - a) inhaled nitric oxide;
  - b) nebulised prostacyclin;
  - c) oral or intravenous sildenafil (care may have systemic effects).
- In the event of progressive or worsening haemodynamic status, early implementation of acute mechanical circulatory support should be considered.

#### 19 **What are the principles of managing <sup>a</sup> failing systemic morphologically right ventricle in the intensive care unit?**

- This may be seen in a number of conditions, including congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA) or TGA repaired with an atrial switch procedure.
- Reversible causes (arrhythmia, volume overload) should be sought and treated.
- In these patients, the coronary arteries are usually angiographically unobstructed. If an electrocardiogram suggests ischaemia, however, coronary angiography is indicated.
- Interventions used for systemic ventricular failure in the non-congenital patient (pharmacological and mechanical support) may be less useful in this patient population, although intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation can be helpful (taking care to use an appropriately sized balloon for the individual patient aortic diameter) in older patients.
- The role of newer inodilators, such as levosimendan, is uncertain.
- In some centres, multi-site pacing has been used with good effect; however, even simple heart rate optimisation and modification of atrioventricular (AV) delay may significantly alter haemodynamics.
- In the event of progressive or worsening haemodynamic status, early implementation of acute mechanical circulatory support should be considered.

#### 20 **What considerations should be made when managing patients with a Fontan circulation in the intensive care unit?**

• The combination of univentricular circulation and systemic venous hypertension in a Fontan circulation is challenging to manage.

- The passive flow of blood from the systemic venous circulation to the pulmonary circulation depends upon adequate preload and avoidance of pulmonary hypertension.
- The positive pressure involved in mechanical ventilation does considerably reduce the systemic cardiac output and can cause significant haemodynamic instability. If mechanical ventilation is unavoidable, the cardiac output should be optimised by keeping intrathoracic pressure low, draining pleural effusions, avoiding pulmonary vasoconstrictors and treating bronchoconstriction.
- Ventilator settings should be titrated accordingly, aiming for early extubation, if possible.
- Patients with Fontan circulation have very poor tolerance of hypovolaemia, are at high risk of atrial arrhythmias (which can be lethal) and at risk of thrombi.
- Atrial arrhythmias should be prevented and standard practice, such as optimisation of electrolytes, should not be underestimated.
- It is important to remember that some patients may not have transvenous access to the heart if pacing is indicated, such as those with a TCPC; in this case, external pacing should be available. It is essential to always involve an expert in the care of such patients.

#### 21 **What considerations should be made for managing <sup>a</sup> univentricular heart (non-Fontan) on the intensive care unit?**

- When considering the use of inotropic and vasoactive agents, the nature of the pulmonary connections must be considered.
- The unprotected pulmonary circulation with or without Eisenmenger physiology should be managed, so as to minimise any further increase in pulmonary artery pressures.
- Where the pulmonary vasculature is protected by pulmonary artery stenosis/banding, the relative effects of pulmonary versus systemic constriction or dilatation may be different when compared with cases where there is an absent pulmonary connection with systemicpulmonary collaterals or shunts.
- In the patient with absent pulmonary connection and systemicpulmonary collaterals/shunts, a small increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) may result in a significant reduction in pulmonary blood flow and dramatic desaturation. In contrast, an increase in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and/or a fall in PVR may result in an increase in systemic-pulmonary shunting with a fall in cardiac output.
- Attention should also be paid to oxygen administration, as this may itself alter the balance between pulmonary and systemic circulations.

Thus, any vasoactive drug should be used with care as the results may be unpredictable.

#### 22 **What are the specific considerations for <sup>a</sup> patient with a systemic-pulmonary shunt?**

- Patients with either a central or Blalock-Taussig type aortopulmonary shunt depend on systemic arterial pressure to maintain pulmonary blood flow via the shunt. In such patients, ensuing desaturation may require systemic vasoconstriction. Additionally, any aggressive ventilatory manoeuvres may reduce pulmonary blood flow.
- Blood pressure measurement can be challenging, as patients who have undergone a full repair following a previous classic or modified Blalock-Taussig shunt, will have a reduced arterial pressure in the ipsilateral arm.
