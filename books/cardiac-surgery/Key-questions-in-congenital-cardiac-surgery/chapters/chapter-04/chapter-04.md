### Congenital echocardiography

**Sian Chivers, Carles Bautista, Nitha Naqvi**

- 1 **What are the principles of echocardiography used for the assessment of congenital heart disease?**
- Hearts with congenital malformation present with an extraordinary variability of lesions. Moreover, these can undergo important modification over time, given the progression of the disease and the natural compensatory adaptation of the heart to the resulting physiological changes.
- Echocardiography remains the mainstay of diagnosis, pre-operative work-up, intra-operative assessement of correction and medical follow-up.
- It is therefore of paramount importance that a systematic approach to scanning congenitally malformed hearts is adopted.
- This fundamental approach uses sequential segmental analysis, which is applied to the description of all congenitally malformed hearts.
- It relies on the recognition of the three morphological cardiac segments (atria, ventricles and arterial trunks), and how the segments are connected to each other.
- Whenever possible, this principle should be adopted in all scans, although focused interrogations are used in specific circumstances.
- 2 **What are the different types of echocardiography used for the assessment of congenital heart disease?**
- Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) which uses a handheld transducer, containing a piezoelectric crystal to transmit the ultrasound beam, that is applied directly to the chest or abdomen to obtain the image. It is the commonest type of echocardiography.
- Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) which uses a specialised probe consisting of a long shaft with both a rigid and mobile component, and a tip containing the piezoelectric crystal for ultrasound image transduction. The probe has controls for adjusting

rotation and angulation of its tip and is passed down into the oesophagus and stomach, where images are taken at different levels. Adult, paediatric and neonatal size probes are available. In children, TOE is carried out under general anaesthesia. It can be used to:

- a) give a detailed assessment of valve morphology, both pre- and intra-operatively;
- b) ascertain cardiac function during intra-operative imaging;
- c) assess for intracardiac air post-bypass;
- d) guide transcatheter procedures in congenital heart disease, such as device closure of an atrial or ventricular septal defect.
- Epicardial echocardiography where the standard smallest transthoracic probe (in a sterile plastic sleeve) is placed directly on the epicardium with the chest open and manipulated to image the internal cardiac structures. It can be used intra-operatively or on the paediatric intensive care unit when the patient's chest is open.

#### 3 **What are the different modes of two-dimensional echocardiography?**

- B-mode echocardiography where multiple ultrasound reflections are processed by the machine to produce a live moving 2D image of the structure of interest.
- M-mode echocardiography (Figure 1) where a single chosen ultrasound line is displayed that gives a time motion display of that specific region. This technique is most often used to assess left ventricular function, including fractional shortening, and myocardial thickness.
- Doppler echocardiography which utilises the principle of the Doppler effect to assess the direction and velocity of blood flow. The image can be presented in colour using the BART nomenclature (Blue Away, Red Towards) of blue colour implying blood flow away from the transducer and red colour implying blood flow towards the transducer (Figure 2). The image may also be shown as a waveform around a baseline, showing blood flow towards the transducer as above the baseline and blood flow away from the transducer as below the baseline. Blood flow velocity (m/s) can be estimated by the transducer and calculations can then be made to estimate pressure gradients (mmHg).

- 4 **What are the key views for obtaining echocardiographic images in congenital transthoracic echocardiography?**
- Abdominal views, including:
  - a) short-axis situs view (Figure 3A);
  - b) long-axis of the abdominal aorta (Figure 3B);
  - c) long-axis of the inferior vena cava (Figure 3C).

- Subcostal long-axis and short-axis views.
- Apical four-chamber (Figure 4) and five-chamber (aorta is known as the 5th chamber) views.

#### 5 **When is three-dimensional imaging commonly used?**

- Modern machines may use specialised probes to obtain 3D echocardiographic images and specific computer software to process the image after acquisition.
- 3D echocardiographic images are commonly used to demonstrate cardiac morphology, heart valves, septal structures or complex lesions, in order to aid interventional or surgical planning.
- 3D echocardiographic assessment of cardiac function can be helpful, but challenging for dilated ventricles or functionally single ventricles, and functional analysis should be interpreted with caution in patients with abnormal anatomy.
- Live 3D echo is particularly helpful to guide interventions, such as device closure of septal defects.

#### 6 **What is the Z-score?**

- The Z-score is the number of standard deviations (SD) of a measurement from the mean.
- A measurement 2 SD above the mean will have a Z-score of +2 (97.7th percentile), whereas a Z-score of -2 indicates the measurement is 2 SD below the mean (2.3rd percentile).

• Measurements of all cardiac structures can be undertaken with subsequent application of Z-scores relative to the patient's body surface area.

#### 7 **What are the characteristics of an atrial septal defect on echocardiography?**

• Patent foramen ovale (PFO) — which can usually be best seen as a small communication in the central portion of the atrial septum on the subcostal view (Figure 8). They are usually <4mm in size. In usual situs solitus, blood flow from the left atrium to the right is red on colour Doppler, whilst blood flow in the opposite direction from the right to left atrium appears blue on TTE (colours are reversed on TOE). In adults, a PFO may be difficult to see on TTE and a bubble contrast echocardiogram may be required for detection.

**Figure 8. Subcostal images demonstrating a: A) patent foramen ovale (PFO, red arrow); and B) left-to right blood flow on the corresponding colour flow Doppler image. RA = right atrium; LA = left atrium; RV = right ventricle; LV = left ventricle.**

- Secundum ASD which can be seen as a communication in the central portion of the atrial septum on the subcostal view (Figure 9). In large defects, the rims of the defect should be ascertained utilising multiple views to assess suitability for transcatheter device closure.
- Primum ASD which can be seen as a defect at the junction of the primum atrial septum and atrioventricular valves on the subcostal and apical views (Figure 10). An absence of the usual offsetting of the tricuspid and mitral valves is noted, as instead of the tricuspid valve septal attachment normally being slightly lower than the mitral valve, in primum ASD, the right and left atrioventricular valves are at the same level.

• Superior sinus venosus defect — which can be seen as a defect in close proximity to the pulmonary veins and superior vena cava on a high right parasternal view.

- Coronary sinus defect which can be seen as a defect secondary to unroofing of coronary sinus tissue on the subcostal view.
- Right atrial and right ventricular dilatation associated with secondary volume overload may also be seen and are best assessed from the apical four-chamber view. This view, however, is inadequate to assess the ASD size, as the ultrasound beam is perpendicular to the defect causing dropout of the image that may lead to an overestimation of size.
- The rims of the ASD are determined on multiple views, including:
  - a) subcostal four-chamber view to assess the rim towards the SVC junction and towards the atrioventricular valves;
  - b) subcostal short-axis view to assess the SVC and IVC junctions with the RA;
  - c) parasternal short-axis view to assess the anterior-posterior relationship from the aortic root and especially the adequacy of the aortic rim;
  - d) high right parasternal view to assess a sinus venosus defect, with the probe in the superior-inferior orientation.

#### 8 **What are the principles of assessing <sup>a</sup> patent ductus arteriosus on echocardiography?**

- Echocardiographic assessment is best obtained from the suprasternal notch and left subclavicular views.
- It should include demonstration of the haemodynamic features that would influence whether the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is haemodynamically significant, and the important details to plan successful surgical intervention, including the:
  - a) course and size of the PDA (Figure 11);
  - b) velocity and direction of the shunt, utilising both Doppler assessment of blood flow and colour flow Doppler;
  - c) estimation of the pulmonary artery pressure, using the peak systolic velocity; also measuring simultaneous non-invasive systolic blood pressure at the time of the echocardiographic measurement;
  - d) left atrial and ventricular size (which will be dilated in the presence of a significant PDA), and left ventricular function;
  - e) arch-sidedness and branching pattern of the head and neck vessels;
  - f) presence of coarctation or hypoplasia;
  - g) presence of branch pulmonary artery stenosis.

B) Corresponding colour image showing red flow in the PDA passing from the aorta into the pulmonary artery. C) Doppler showing continuous left to right flow in the PDA.**

#### 9 **What are the principles of assessing <sup>a</sup> ventricular septal defect on echocardiography?**

- Echocardiography is used to determine the position, borders, size and number of ventricular septal defects (VSDs).
- Perimembranous VSDs (Figure 12) are best assessed in the shortaxis view where the fibrous continuity is noted between the aortic and tricuspid valves. It is important to delineate any muscular extension and the margins of the VSD, which can be achieved by sweeps of the septum in the parasternal and apical views. The subcostal views may be useful in neonates and infants. Evidence of aortic valve incompetence should also be ascertained.
- Muscular VSDs (Figure 13) are best assessed by a short-axis sweep of the ventricular septum and a posterior to anterior sweep of the

![](_page_10_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 12. Echocardiographic images demonstrating a large perimembranous ventricular septal defect (\*) on: A) apical four-chamber view; B) corresponding colour flow Doppler image; C) parasternal short-axis view (where the green arrow represents the VSD and the red arrow the aortic-tricuspid valve continuity); and D) corresponding colour flow Doppler image. RA = right atrium; LA = left atrium; RV = right ventricle; LV = left ventricle. Ao = aorta; PA = pulmonary artery; TV = tricuspid valve.**

septum in the apical view. The whole septum should be assessed with a low Nyquist limit (colour scale). These VSDs may be small, large or multiple throughout the ventricular septum.

- Doubly-committed subarterial VSD (Figure 14) is best assessed in the subcostal short-axis view, where a fibrous continuity between the aortic and pulmonary valves can be seen. Evidence of aortic or pulmonary valve incompetence should also be ascertained.
- When echocardiography is performed on a patient with a VSD, there are a number of features that should be assessed, including the:
  - a) whole interventricular septum, to ensure that all defects are identified, as this will influence the operative approach;

![](_page_11_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 13. Echocardiographic images demonstrating multiple muscular ventricular septal defects (arrows) on the: A) apical fourchamber view; and B) corresponding colour flow Doppler image. RA = right atrium; LA = left atrium; RV = right ventricle; LV = left ventricle.**

**Figure 14. Echocardiographic image demonstrating a doubly-committed subarterial ventricular septal defect (\*) with evidence of continuity (red line) between the aortic and pulmonary valves. Ao = aorta; PA = pulmonary artery.**

- b) degree of ventricular volume overload and function;
- c) septal attachment of the tricuspid valve and evidence of valve straddling;
- d) aortic valve for evidence of regurgitation;
- e) right ventricular outflow tract muscle bundles.
- Postoperatively, following VSD repair, it is important to assess the:
  - a) repair and identify any evidence of patch leak;
  - b) left ventricular function;
  - c) tricuspid valve function and identify regurgitation;
  - d) Doppler gradient across the pulmonary artery, if the patient has undergone banding.

#### 10 **What are the principles of assessing aortic valve disease on echocardiography?**

- The best views to assess obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract include the:
  - a) parasternal long-axis (Figure 15) which can determine the length of the outflow tract, the presence of any muscular tissue or membrane at subaortic and supra-aortic levels, as well as motion and thickness of the aortic valve leaflets, including cusp prolapse and lack of coaptation. Colour flow Doppler in this view may identify the presence of aortic valve regurgitation;
  - b) parasternal short-axis which can determine the number of aortic valve cusps and any abnormalities in functionality of the valve, including the presence of a raphe. Colour flow Doppler in this view may identify areas of regurgitation secondary to poor coaptation of the valve leaflets. The short-axis view at the level of the ventricle can also show any associated left ventricular hypertrophy (Figure 16);
  - c) apical five-chamber and subcostal short-axis which can determine the length of the left ventricular outflow tract. Colour flow Doppler in this view is particularly useful in showing areas of turbulent flow and regurgitation, as it provides an appropriate angulation for Doppler interrogation of the area.
- Pulsed wave and continuous Doppler (Figure 17) can also be used to estimate the severity of stenosis. By aligning the left ventricular outflow tract with the cursor and utilising Doppler, the peak velocity can be measured and the peak and mean pressure gradients can be

calculated. The best views are the high right parasternal, the apical five-chamber and the subcostal short-axis, as they provide the best alignment with the cursor. If the outflow tract is not aligned with the cursor, the estimation will be incorrect.

**Figure 17. High right parasternal view with continuous wave Doppler demonstrating a peak velocity of 4.5m/s across the aortic valve, consistent with aortic stenosis.**

#### 11 **What are the principles of assessing mitral valve disease on echocardiography?**

• In TTE, the parasternal long-axis, apical four-chamber (Figure 18) and apical two-chamber views are best to visualise the mitral valve, as well as subcostal views.

![](_page_15_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 18. Apical four-chamber view demonstrating turbulent colour flow through a severely stenotic mitral valve, an enlarged left atrium and bowing of the interatrial septum into the right atrium. RA = right atrium; LA = left atrium.**

- The praecordial short-axis views demonstrate the number and arrangement of the papillary muscles, which are usually situated at the 3 o'clock and 8 o'clock positions in this view. Absence, hypoplasia or fusion of the papillary muscles (as in a parachute mitral valve) may be demonstrated.
- Isolated cleft of the mitral valve can be demonstrated in the subcostal and parasternal short-axis views. The cleft 'points' towards the outflow tract. The additional goal of imaging this lesion is to ensure there is no evidence of outflow tract obstruction, as chordal attachments to the septum may be seen.

- The short-axis view may also demonstrate an arcade mitral valve or double-orifice mitral valve.
- Supramitral rings may present with only subtle findings on echocardiography, as the rings may be very close to and fused with the valve leaflets. Additional valvular or subvalvular pathology is usually present.
- In a patient with isolated mitral regurgitation, the diagnosis of anamolous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) should be diligently excluded.
- Colour flow Doppler and continuous wave Doppler are used extensively in the assessment of severity of regurgitation or stenosis.
- 3D echocardiography can be used to demonstrate both the mitral valve leaflets and subvalvular apparatus and can be manipulated to display the surgical view of the valve.

#### 12 **What are the principles of assessing cor triatriatum on echocardiography?**

• Cor triatriatum is a condition where there is separation of blood flow between the pulmonary veins and the mitral valve, secondary to a membranous partition within the left atrium, which is seen best in the apical or subcostal four-chamber views (Figure 19).

![](_page_16_Figure_9.jpeg)

**Figure 19. Subcostal four-chamber view demonstrating: A) a cor triatriatum membrane (green arrow) above the level of the mitral valve leaflets (white arrows); with B) a narrow jet of flow passing through the membrane on the corresponding colour flow Doppler image. RA = right atrium; LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle.**

- In almost all cases, there is a communicating orifice within the membrane that will allow varying degrees of blood flow. Echocardiography should assess the position of the membrane and any restriction to blood flow.
- The atrial septum is most often intact but an ASD may be present in some cases.

#### 13 **What are the principles of assessing total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage on echocardiography?**

• In the normal heart, the best position to assess the pulmonary veins is in the left subclavicular view. Reducing the Nyquist limit (colour scale) will enable the pulmonary veins to be viewed in the characteristic 'crab view', where the 'legs' of the crab are formed by the pulmonary veins and the 'claws' by the right SVC and left atrial appendage (Figure 20).

![](_page_17_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Figure 20. Left subclavicular ('crab') view demonstrating the pulmonary veins joining the left atrium. LUPV = left upper pulmonary vein; RUPV = right upper pulmonary vein; LLPV = left lower pulmonary vein; RLPV = right lower pulmonary vein.**

• Supracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC, Figure 21) is characterised by the pulmonary venous confluence draining via a vertical vein that courses superiorly into the left innominate vein, superior vena cava or azygos vein and thereafter the right atrium. The left subclavicular view can be used to assess the venous confluence and the suprasternal notch view to assess the connections via the vertical vein and innominate vein. In younger

![](_page_18_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 21. Suprasternal view demonstrating a supracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous connection with a vertical vein (VV) draining the confluence of the right pulmonary veins (RPVs) and the left pulmonary veins (LPVs). The blood flow in the vertical vein ascends and then connects to the innominate vein draining into the superior vena cava (SVC). Ao = aorta; PA = pulmonary artery.**

children, the subcostal views may also be used to identify the pulmonary veins.

• Cardiac TAPVC (Figure 22) is characterised by the pulmonary veins joining via a confluence to the coronary sinus and thereafter draining into the right atrium. The subcostal view best shows the pulmonary veins draining into a severely dilated coronary sinus with a characteristic 'tail of the whale' appearance. The associated ASD is also best seen in the subcostal view with an obligate right-to-left shunt (blue colour Doppler flow from the right atrium to the left atrium).

![](_page_19_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 22. Subcostal view demonstrating: A) an intracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous connection with the right pulmonary veins (RPVs) and left pulmonary veins (LPVs) draining into the coronary sinus (CS), creating a characteristic appearance resembling a 'tail of a whale' (outlined in green); and B) a small left atrium (LA) that fills with blood passing from the right atrium (RA) via a secundum atrial septal defect (blue flow with arrow), on the corresponding colour flow Doppler image. LV = left ventricle; RV = right ventricle.**

• Infracardiac TAPVC (Figure 23) is characterised by the pulmonary venous confluence draining into a vertical descending vein that courses inferiorly to the portal vein or hepatic veins and thereafter the

![](_page_19_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Figure 23. Echocardiographic images demonstrating: A) an infracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous connection with images taken from high on the left chest show a descending vein (DV, outlined in green); and B) continuous high-velocity flow due to obstruction on Doppler taken in the descending vein.**

- inferior vena cava and right atrium. This type of anomalous pulmonary venous connection is most prone to obstruction and requires emergency lifesaving surgery.
- Careful attention should be made in all cases of total anomalous pulmonary venous connection to rule out obstruction, which is an indication for immediate surgical intervention.

#### 14 **What are the principles of assessing an atrioventricular septal defect on echocardiography?**

- A complete atrioventricular septal defect (cAVSD) can be assessed in different echocardiographic views, including the:
  - a) apical view (Figure 24) which will show an absence of offsetting of the usual tricuspid and mitral valves, as instead of the tricuspid valve septal attachment being slightly lower than the mitral valve, in cAVSD the common atrioventricular (AV) valve is at a single level, and shared across the two ventricles. This view will also allow assessment of the size of the valve annulus and chordal attachments. With a large VSD component, it is important to assess valvular attachments and whether there is any evidence of valve straddling;
  - b) subcostal short-axis view (Figure 25) which can delineate the common valve 'en face', so that the size and position of the individual leaflets may be assessed. In this view, determination of the Rastelli classification of the valve is visualised to aid surgical planning, clefts may be seen, and colour flow Doppler can demonstrate the location of the valvular regurgitation. Tilting the probe delineates the papillary muscles.
- In addition, the presence of any associated lesions should also be identified, including:
  - a) patent ductus arteriosus;
  - b) coarctation of the aorta;
  - c) secundum ASD;
  - d) additional VSDs;
  - e) tetralogy of Fallot.

![](_page_21_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 24. Apical views demonstrating atrioventricular septal defects (AVSD): A) a primum septal defect (green asterisk) can be seen, associated with the lack of the normal offset between the atrioventricular valves (red line), as both the left and right are at the same level, which is a diagnostic feature of AVSD; B) shunting of blood from the left atrium (LA) to the right atrium (RA) across the defect (arrow) on the corresponding colour flow Doppler image; C) a complete atrioventricular septal defect with an atrial component (green arrow), just above the common atrioventricular valve (CAVV), and a ventricular component (red arrow), just below the CAVV, which has its valve tissue at the same level on both sides on the septum. In addition, there is a muscular ventricular septal defect (blue arrow). LV = left ventricle; RV = right ventricle.**

## What are the principles of assessing tetralogy of Fallot on echocardiography?

 The subcostal anterior oblique view (Figure 26) can demonstrate the subpulmonary infundibulum, pulmonary valve, main pulmonary artery and ventricular septum. It also gives excellent alignment for Doppler assessment of the gradient across the right ventricular outflow tract.

![](_page_22_Figure_6.jpeg)

Figure 26. Echocardiographic images of tetralogy of Fallot: A) subcostal right anterior oblique view demonstrating a ventricular septal defect (\*) caused by anterocephalad deviation of the outlet septum (OS); with B) right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (turbulent yellow/cyan flow beginning in the subpulmonary area) on the corresponding colour flow Doppler image; C) parasternal long-axis view demonstrating the aorta overriding the ventricular septal defect (red arrow). LPA = left pulmonary artery; RPA = right pulmonary artery; PT = pulmonary trunk; LA = left atrium; RA = right atrium; RV = right ventricle; TV = tricuspid valve; Ao = aorta.

• In tetralogy of Fallot, Doppler assessment of the right ventricular outflow tract demonstrates a dual-profile waveform (Figure 27). The smooth ellipse represents the fixed obstruction at the pulmonary valve level, whereas the triangular dagger-shape trace represents the dynamic obstruction from the muscular infundibulum.

![](_page_23_Figure_3.jpeg)

**<sup>150</sup> Figure 27. Continuous wave Doppler across the right ventricular outflow tract demonstrating a peak gradient >100mmHg with a dual-profile waveform, consisting of a fixed parabolic-shaped and dynamic dagger-shaped obstruction.**

- One of the most important features to check on echocardiography is evidence of a coronary artery crossing the right ventricular outflow tract, as this will alter the surgical approach. A key abnormality is the left anterior descending artery arising from the right coronary artery in 3% of cases. This is best imaged in the parasternal short-axis view but in cases where the coronary artery anatomy is not clear, a CT scan may be indicated.
- Postoperatively, assessment of the blood flow within the RVOT will differ depending on the type of repair, including:
  - a) valve-sparing technique unobstructed forward flow with limited pulmonary valve regurgitation;
  - b) transannular patch unobstructed forward flow and free pulmonary regurgitation;
  - c) RV to PA conduit unobstructed forward flow and good flow into the branch pulmonary arteries. Over time, obstruction may develop and can be assessed by increased flow velocity on Doppler echocardiography.

#### 16 **What are the principles of assessing pulmonary atresia with an intact septum on echocardiography?**

- There are two distinct types of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA-IVS), including with a:
  - a) hypoplastic right ventricle;
  - b) dilated right ventricle (less common).
- Assessment of PA-IVS with a hypoplastic right ventricle includes:
  - a) tricuspid valve annulus size which is measured in the apical view with a Z-score quantification against body surface area;
  - b) tricuspid regurgitation which is assessed by colour Doppler on the same view;
  - c) right ventricle size which is assessed from the apical and parasternal short-axis views, and compared to left ventricular size. These views are also used to identify evidence of RV hypertrophy or endocardial fibroelastosis, which is suggested by a bright myocardial appearance on echocardiography;
  - d) RV sinusoids which are communications between the RV cavity and the coronary arteries, found in 50% of cases, and best assessed in the apical and short-axis windows, with colour flow Doppler;
  - e) luminal discontinuity between the RV and main pulmonary artery — which is demonstrated by a lack of forward flow on colour flow Doppler assessment of the RVOT, and can be assessed from a number of echocardiographic windows, including the subcostal short-axis and oblique views, and the parasternal long- and short-axis views;
  - f) pulmonary valve atresia which is seen in almost all patients;
  - g) main and branch pulmonary arteries size which are usually normal in size, and visualised in the parasternal short-axis and high parasternal views.
- Assessment of PA-IVS with a dilated right ventricle includes:
  - a) severity of tricuspid valve regurgitation which is best assessed from the apical view utilising colour flow Doppler;
  - b) severity of right atrial and RV dilatation which requires multiple views including apical, long- and short-axis;
  - c) membranous atresia of the pulmonary valve which is usually seen;
  - d) main and branch pulmonary arteries size which are usually normal in size.

#### 17 **What are the principles of assessing pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect on echocardiography?**

- In pulmonary atresia with VSD, the branch pulmonary arteries are commonly hypoplastic, as compared to the normal calibre branch pulmonary arteries found in pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum.
- These branch pulmonary arteries are usually supplied by multiple major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs) rather than a single duct.
- To assess this by echocardiography, high parasternal short-axis and suprasternal notch views should be used (Figure 28).
- When multiple collaterals are present, assessment by CT is useful to clearly delineate the course of the vessels and guide surgical planning.

**Figure 28. A) High parasternal short-axis view; and B) corresponding colour flow Doppler image demonstrating pulmonary atresia, characterised by pulmonary artery branches without a connection to the main pulmonary artery. Ao = aorta; RPA = right pulmonary artery; LPA = left pulmonary artery.**

#### 18 **What are the principles of assessing transposition of the great arteries on echocardiography?**

• A number of views and sweeps are used to determine ventriculoarterial discordance and the presence or absence of the common associated features.

- The pulmonary artery is seen to arise from the left ventricle and bifurcates into the right and left pulmonary arteries, whilst the aorta arises from the right ventricle with branching of the head and neck vessels.
- The classic diagnostic view is the parasternal long-axis view, which shows parallel great vessels ('gun-barrel appearance', Figure 29).

![](_page_26_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 29. Parasternal long-axis view demonstrating transposition of the great arteries, characterised by parallel great vessels with the pulmonary artery (PA) arising from the left ventricle (LV) and the aorta (Ao) arising from the right ventricle (RV). LA = left atrium.**

- In the parasternal short-axis view, both the aortic and pulmonary valves are viewed 'en face', compared to the usual view of the aortic valve 'en face' and length of the main pulmonary artery. From this, the relationship of the aorta and pulmonary artery can be determined with the aorta typically anterior and to the right, although a side-byside arrangement can also occur.
- Pulmonary artery flow from the patent ductus arteriosus, which can be seen on the subcostal and apical views, also helps to distinguish it from the aorta.

- Pre-operatively, a number of other echocardiographic features should also be assessed, including:
  - a) interatrial communication size and flow velocity;
  - b) presence and location of a VSD;
  - c) position of the aorta relative to the pulmonary artery;
  - d) coronary artery anatomy which can be assessed using the parasternal short-axis view, as well as the apical and subcostal views. The most common coronary artery pattern is the left coronary artery arising from sinus 1 and the right coronary artery from sinus 2, using the Leiden convention for naming sinuses. The presence of an intramural course of a coronary artery is also important to rule out or to highlight to the surgeon, as this is associated with a higher intra-operative risk when the arterial switch is performed;
  - e) presence of any outflow tract obstruction;
  - f) evidence, size and flow pattern of the PDA.
- Following an arterial switch operation, postoperative echocardiographic imaging shoud include assessment of:
  - a) myocardial function as a key indicator of coronary artery function;
  - b) neo-aortic root for evidence of dilatation and neo-aortic valve regurgitation;
  - c) right ventricular outflow tract and branch pulmonary arteries for evidence of stenosis. The branch pulmonary arteries can be seen in the suprasternal view following the Le Compte manoeuvre.

#### 19 **What are the principles of assessing coarctation of the aorta on echocardiography?**

- Coarctation of the aorta can be assessed on several different echocardiographic views, including:
  - a) suprasternal long-axis view (Figure 30) with ductal cuts which typically demonstrate a:
    - i) localised discrete juxtaductal narrowing, with a thin fibrous membrane shelf protruding from the posterior wall, just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. In some cases, the narrowing may be a long segment or associated with hypoplasia of the transverse arch;

![](_page_28_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 30. Suprasternal long-axis view of coarctation of the aorta demonstrating: A) a localised discrete juxtaductal narrowing, with a shelf (arrow) protruding from the posterior wall, just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery; B) aliasing (yellow colour) at the coarctation site on the corresponding colour flow Doppler image; and C) lower-velocity Doppler with a characterstic diastolic tail on continuous wave Doppler.**

- ii) high-velocity turbulence at the coarctation site on colour flow Doppler;
- iii) characteristic diastolic tail pattern with continuous wave (CW) Doppler at the coarctation site (high peak systolic velocity with diastolic run-off);
- b) situs view which reveals reduced pulsatility of the abdominal aorta;

c) abdominal aortic pulsed wave (PW) Doppler image — which shows the characteristic continuous low-velocity anterograde flow with a prolonged time to peak velocity (Figure 31).

![](_page_29_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Figure 31. Abdominal aortic pulsed wave Doppler image in a patient with coarctation of the aorta demonstrating a low-velocity and diastolic continuation.**

- In addition, there are some echocardiographic clues that are suggestive of neonatal coarctation, including:
  - a) high left atrial pressure;
  - b) disproportionate ventricles, with a smaller left ventricle and right heart dilatation;
  - c) mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis or left ventricular hypertrophy;
  - d) impaired left ventricular systolic function;
  - e) increased distance between the left subclavian and the left common carotid arteries (50% greater than the distance between the innominate and the left common carotid arteries) in the arch view.

#### 20 **What are the principles of assessing truncus arteriosus on echocardiography?**

• Truncus arteriosus arises as a solitary arterial vessel from the base of the heart, giving rise to the aorta, pulmonary and coronary arterial supply. It is best seen in the subcostal and apical five-chamber views (Figure 32).

![](_page_30_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 32. Echocardiography images demonstrating Type I truncus arteriosus characterised by: A) branching of the truncus into the aorta and pulmonary artery, and a dysplastic truncal valve (arrow); and B) truncal valve regurgitation (arrow) and forward flow into the branch pulmonary arteries. Ao = aorta; PA = pulmonary artery; TA = truncus arteriosus; RV = right ventricle; LV = left ventricle; RPA = right pulmonary artery; LPA = left pulmonary artery.**

- Echocardiographic assessment of a patient with truncus arteriosus should include:
  - a) size and location of the VSD;
  - b) truncal valve structure, number of leaflets (best seen in the parasternal short-axis view) and degree of truncal regurgitation;
  - c) type of truncus arteriosus with Type I being the commonest (50-65%);
  - d) coronary artery variation with a single coronary artery frequently occurring.
- Care must be taken on echocardiography to distinguish truncus arteriosus from an aortopulmonary window or aortic atresia with a hypoplastic ascending aorta.
- 21 **What are the principles of assessing congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries on echocardiography?**
- Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA) is characterised by the combination of atrioventricular (AV) discordance and ventriculo-arterial (VA) discordance.

- On echocardiography, the only anomaly that may be seen is the ventricles are switched around, with the morphological RV being on the left and the morphological LV being on the right.
- As the ventricles can be identified by their atrioventricular valves, which remain constant, the morphological RV can be recognised as it is attached to the tricuspid valve, which is offset apically, having a more inferior attachment on the interventricular septum than the mitral valve (Figure 33).

![](_page_31_Picture_4.jpeg)

**<sup>158</sup> Figure 33. Echocardiographic images demonstrating congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA): A) pre-operative images with reverse offsetting of the mitral (green arrow) and tricuspid valves (blue arrow), with the more inferiorly inserted tricuspid valve being on the left, as well as the presence of a ventricular septal defect (\*); B) postoperative images following a double-switch procedure, where the baffle of the left atrium (LA, green asterisk) can be seen towards the right-sided mitral valve and morphological left ventricle (mLV). The baffle of the venous drainage from the right atrium (RA, blue asterisk) to the morphological right ventricle (mRV) can be seen on the left; C) corresponding colour flow Doppler image following a double-switch procedure illustrating pulmonary venous blood passing through the baffle to the right side of the heart.**

- In ccTGA, the coronary arteries are inverted, with the morphologically left coronary artery (LCA) arising from the patient's right-sided sinus and the morphologically right coronary artery (RCA) from the left-sided sinus.
- A variety of coronary arterial patterns, however, can be seen, with the most common being a single sinus origin of the two main coronary arteries or the LCA arising from RCA.
- Although careful pre-operative echocardiographic imaging can delineate the coronary anatomy, a CT, MRI or angiography may also be required.

- In addition, a number of associated anomalies should be identified, inlcuding:
  - a) ventricular septal defect which is commonly a perimembranous outflow subpulmonary defect. It is important to note that in the presence of a large VSD with inlet extension, especially with straddling or overriding of the tricuspid valve, the normal reverse offsetting clue is not present on echocardiography;
  - b) LV outflow tract obstruction which may be seen as stenosis at a subpulmonary or pulmonary valve level;
  - c) abnormalities of the tricuspid valve (frequently Ebstein's anomaly) — which is seen on the left-sided morphological right ventricle in the apical four-chamber view.
- In the long-term follow-up of these patients, it is important to assess a number of factors, including:
  - a) systemic RV function, as most patients will develop progressive RV dysfunction, and in some cases, as early as the first decade of life;
  - b) PA band gradient and careful evaluation of the pulmonary artery branches for distortion, in patients who have undergone temporary pulmonary artery banding to train the morphological LV;
  - c) biventricular function to guide the need for resynchronisation therapy;
  - d) tricuspid valve function and degree of regurgitation to determine the need for tricuspid valve replacement.

#### 22 **What are the principles of assessing double-outlet right ventricle on echocardiography?**

- Double-outlet right ventricle (DORV) is best seen in the parasternal long-axis view, when the aorta overrides the interventricular septum by >50%. (Figure 34).
- The VSD can be subaortic, subpulmonary or doubly committed, and rarely even, non-committed.
- DORV can be found in association with tetralogy of Fallot, aortic stenosis or coarctation.
- The Taussig-Bing malformation associates a double-outlet right ventricle with a subpulmonary VSD and discordant ventriculo-arterial connections (Figure 35).

![](_page_33_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 34. Parasternal long-axis view demonstrating double-outlet right ventricle, characterised by the aorta overriding the interventricular septum (\*) by >50% and aorto-mitral discontinuity. RV = right ventricle; LA = left atrium; Ao = aorta.**

**Figure 35. Subcostal views demonstrating a: A) Taussig-Bing anomaly, characterised by a double-outlet right ventricle with the aorta lying to the right of the pulmonary artery and completely arising from the RV, and a subpulmonary ventricular septal defect (\*); and B) the pulmonary artery with flow (red) from a patent ductus arteriosus, allowing it to be distinguished from the aorta, on the corresponding colour flow Doppler image. RV = right ventricle; LV = left ventricle; Ao = aorta; PA = pulmonary artery.**

#### 23 **What are the principles of assessing vascular rings on echocardiography?**

• Vascular rings are usually diagnosed with suprasternal echocardiographic views and often confirmed by CT or MRI (Figure 36).

![](_page_34_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 36. Suprasternal view colour flow Doppler images demonstrating <sup>161</sup> a: A) double aortic arch (\*); and B) left pulmonary artery sling, with the left pulmonary artery (LPA) originating (arrow) from the right pulmonary artery (RPA), rather than its usual origin (\*) at a symmetrical bifurcation with the right pulmonary artery. Ao = aorta; PA = pulmonary artery.**

• Vascular rings can be diagnosed by foetal sonographers, such as a right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery and left ductus arteriosus.

#### 24 **What are the principles of assessing isomerism on echocardiography?**

- Isomerism refers to the atrial appendages and not the entire atria.
- As the appendages are not usually seen on echocardiography, the situs is inferred from the arrangement of the aorta and IVC or azygos and hemiazygos venous systems on the subcostal view (Figure 37).
- On echocardiography, right isomerism is characterised by an absent coronary sinus and totally anomalous pulmonary venous connection. In addition, there is often an AVSD, poorly formed atrial septum, DORV with pulmonary stenosis or atresia, bilateral vena cavae, rightsided heart and left-handed ventricular topology.
- On echocardiography, left isomerism is characterised by an interrupted IVC and azygos continuation. In addition, there is often an AVSD and bilateral vena cavae.

![](_page_35_Figure_3.jpeg)

Schematic illustrations of: B) situs solitus; C) right atrial isomerism; D) left atrial isomerism; and E) mirror image.**

- In addition, other malformations associated with isomerism include:
  - a) common atrioventricular junction which are frequent with both right and left isomerism;
  - b) double-inlet connection which is more frequent with right isomerism;
  - c) biventricular connections which is more frequent with left isomerism;

- d) concordant connections with coarctation which is more frequent with left isomerism;
- e) discordant or double-outlet connections along with pulmonary atresia or stenosis — which is expected with right isomerism.

#### 25 **What are the principles of assessing tricuspid atresia on echocardiography?**

• Anatomically, the valve can be imperforate or there may be an absent connection, which appears echocardiographically as a thick band of the atrioventricular groove separating the atrium from the ventricle (Figure 38).

![](_page_36_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Figure 38. Apical four-chamber view demonstrating tricuspid atresia characterised by a: A) thick band between the right atrium (RA) and the rudimentary right ventricle (RV), consistent with an absent right connection; and B) flow across the open mitral valve but no flow across the absent right connection on the corresponding colour flow Doppler image. LV = left ventricle; LA = left atrium.**

• It is associated with a rudimentary RV, and the left atrium connected to a dominant LV. Ventriculo-arterial connections can be concordant or discordant.

#### 26 **What are the principles of assessing double-inlet ventricle on echocardiography?**

• Echocardiography uses the relationship of the rudimentary ventricle to the main ventricle (not usually by the ventricular trabecular pattern that is much harder to distinguish) to distinguish the three types of double-inlet ventricle:

a) double-inlet LV (DILV, commonest) — which is diagnosed by finding a rudimentary anterosuperior RV either on the left or right hand side of the main ventricle (Figure 39);

![](_page_37_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 39. Apical view (in adult orientation with the apex up) demonstrating a double-inlet to a dominant left ventricle (LV). TV = tricuspid valve; MV= mitral valve.**

- b) double-inlet RV which is associated with a rudimentary posteroinferior LV;
- c) double-inlet to a solitary, usually indeterminate, ventricle (rare).
- The Holmes heart is a DILV with a rudimentary RV and ventriculoarterial concordance.

#### 27 **What are the principles of assessing hypoplastic left heart syndrome on echocardiography?**

• Echocardiographic assessment of a patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome is used to identify a number of features (Figure 40), including:

![](_page_38_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 40. Echocardiography images of hypoplastic left heart syndrome: A) apical four-chamber view demonstrating a globular left ventricle (\*), with bulging of the interatrial septum into the right atrium (RA), suggestive of a restrictive interatrial communication; B) apical four-chamber view demonstrating a slit-like LV (\*); and C) tricuspid regurgitation (blue jet) on the corresponding colour flow Doppler image; D) parasternal short-axis view demonstrating a very small aorta (arrow) relative to the enlarged pulmonary artery (PA); E) suprasternal view demonstrating a small ascending aorta and transverse arch (arrow) relative to the descending aorta (Desc Ao), which is fed by the patent ductus arteriosus. RV = right ventricle; LA = left atrium.**

- a) hypoplastic left ventricle;
- b) distinguishing aortic valve stenosis from aortic atresia by assessing colour flow across the aortic valve;
- c) distinguishing mitral valve stenosis from mitral atresia;
- d) hypoplastic aortic arch and aortic coarctation;
- e) patent ductus arteriosus size which is essential for neonatal survival;
- f) restrictive secundum ASD which worsens prognosis and may require an urgent balloon atrial septostomy;

- g) tricuspid regurgitation;
- h) coronary artery fistulae;
- i) pulmonary venous stenoses or anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (levoatrial cardinal vein);
- j) RV function, using tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and RV fractional area change (FAC).

#### 28 **What are the principles of assessing aortopulmonary window on echocardiography?**

• An aortopulmonary (AP) window is best visualised in the parasternal short-axis or suprasternal arch views, anywhere from just above the semilunar valves to the more distal ascending aorta and main pulmonary artery (Figure 41).

![](_page_39_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Figure 41. Parasternal short-axis view demonstrating an aortopulmonary window (\*), which inserts into the origin of the right pulmonary artery (RPA). Ao = aorta; PA = pulmonary artery.**

- Left heart dilatation due to volume overload from left-to-right shunting will also be present and is best seen in the apical and subcostal fourchamber views.
- The most common lesions associated with AP window are interrupted aortic arch (classically Type A) and coarctation.

#### 29 **What are the principles of assessing anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery on echocardiography?**

• The anomalous left coronary artery typically arises from the left inferolateral aspect of the main pulmonary artery just beyond the pulmonary valve and is best seen in the parasternal short-axis view (Figure 42). It then courses toward the interventricular groove and branches into the left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCX) arteries.

![](_page_40_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 42. Parasternal short-axis view demonstrating: A) an anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA); with B) ALCAPA originating from the pulmonary artery (PA) and dividing into the left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCX) coronary arteries, on the corresponding colour flow Doppler image. Ao = aorta.**

- The retrograde flow from the left coronary artery to the main pulmonary artery is well depicted on echocardiogram and is a characteristic finding of the steal phenomenon.
- The right coronary artery is often dilated.
- An impression of endocardial fibroelastosis is also often seen with brightness of the LV myocardium, especially the papillary muscles.
- Left heart dilation occurs, often associated with functional mitral regurgitation, and is best seen in the apical four-chamber view.

#### 30 **What are the principles of assessing Ebstein's anomaly on echocardiography?**

- Ebstein's anomaly is best seen on the apical (Figure 43) and subcostal four-chamber views, which illustrate the key features, including:
  - a) inferior displacement of the proximal attachments of the septal and posterior leaflets of the tricuspid valve;
  - b) rightward and anterior rotational displacement of the valve which results in 'atrialisation' of the proximal portion of the right ventricle, resulting in a reduction in the size of the functional right ventricle and tricuspid regurgitation;
  - c) secundum ASD which is a frequent association and may show right-to-left shunting on echocardiography;
  - d) non-compaction of the left ventricle which is a known association.

![](_page_41_Figure_8.jpeg)

**Figure 43. Apical four-chamber view of Ebstein's anomaly demonstrating: A) inferior displacement of the septal tricuspid valve leaflet (green arrow), compared to the normally positioned anterior tricuspid valve leaflet origin (red arrow) and septal mitral valve leaflet (blue arrow), thereby creating an atrialised portion of the right ventricle (aRV), whilst the functional portion of the right ventricle (fRV) is small; and B) severe tricuspid regurgitation, on the corresponding colour flow Doppler image. RA = right atrium; LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle.**

- The outflow echocardiographic views, namely the subcostal right anterior oblique and parasternal short-axis views, are used to assess the:
  - a) anterior tricuspid valve leaflet which is frequently redundant and curtain-like, and may cause right ventricular outflow obstruction;
  - b) presence of any anatomical or functional pulmonary atresia.
- An echocardiographic score to assess the severity of Ebstein's anomaly with prognostic implications has been used in neonates, which involves calculating the ratio of the combined area of the right atrium and atrialised right ventricle to that of the functional right ventricle and left heart in a four-chamber view in end-diastole.
