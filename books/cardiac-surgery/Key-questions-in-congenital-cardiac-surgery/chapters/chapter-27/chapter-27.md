### Congenital abnormalities of the mitral valve

**David N. Ranney, Robert D. B. Jaquiss, Andrew J. Lodge**

#### 1 **Describe the function of the mitral valve**

- The mitral valve is one of the two atrioventricular heart valves which lie between the atria and ventricles.
- During diastole, it opens to allow blood to flow in an unobstructed fashion from the left atrium into the left ventricle.
- During systole, the mitral valve closes to allow forward ejection and prevent regurgitation or insufficiency of blood into the left atrium.

#### 2 **Describe the embryology of the mitral valve**

- Mitral valve development begins during the 4th-5th week of gestation and is mostly complete by the 15th week.
- The endocardial cushions fuse during the 6th week of gestation, partitioning the left and right atrioventricular canals. The lateral cushion contributes to the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve while the superior cushion contributes mainly to the anterior leaflet.
- During the 8th week of gestation, the mitral orifice takes shape and groups of trabecular ventricular myocardium are present. This trabecular tissue will later form the papillary muscles by delamination, which usually takes about 17 weeks to complete. Cushion tissue separates and thins out during this time to form the chordae tendineae and leaflets of the mitral valve.

#### 3 **Describe the normal anatomy of the mitral valve**

- The mitral valve is a bicuspid valve consisting of four main components:
  - a) annulus;
  - b) two leaflets;
  - c) two papillary muscles;
  - d) multiple chordae tendineae.

- The annulus is a ring-like fibrous structure that provides the framework of the valve and is continuous with the fibrous skeleton of the heart, as well as the left and right fibrous trigones.
- The mitral valve has two very differently shaped leaflets:
  - a) posterior (mural) leaflet which is attached to three-fifths of the mitral annulus, has a quadrangular shape and is divided into three scallops (P1 lateral, P2 middle, P3 medial);
  - b) anterior (aortic) leaflet which is semi-circular in shape, attached along two-fifths of the annulus and has edges (A1, A2, and A3) that respectively oppose the posterior leaflet scallops.

Both leaflets are anchored at common points, the anterolateral and posteromedial commissures.

- The mitral leaflets are attached to the anterolateral and posteromedial papillary muscles.
- Chordae tendineae connect the papillary muscles to the leaflets. These are sometimes classified as marginal (free edge), rough zone, or strut (basal posterior leaflet). Alternatively, chordae tendineae are referred to as primary (free edge), secondary, and tertiary.

#### 4 **Describe the classification of congenital mitral valve abnormalities**

- Mitral valve disease can be broadly categorised into stenotic and regurgitant lesions.
- Carpentier classified regurgitant lesions based on leaflet motion and structural pathophysiology (Table 1).
- Congenital anomalies can be identified on all components of the mitral valve, presenting individually or more commonly in varying combinations.
- Leaflet anomalies:
  - a) double-orifice mitral valve (Figure 1) which is commonly associated with atrioventricular septal (canal) defects and classified as:
    - i) Type I which is characterised by a bridge between the two leaflets with otherwise normal subvalvular apparatus;
    - ii) Type II which is characterised by two distinct orifices with their own chordal attachments;

- b) imperforate leaflet (also referred to as mitral atresia) which is usually associated with aortic atresia, as with hypoplastic left heart syndrome;
- c) isolated cleft mitral valve which usually involves the aortic (anterior) leaflet. The leaflet components are dysplastic and thickened, as a result of failure of AV cushion fusion, and may result in mitral insufficiency (Figure 2);

**Figure 2.

- d) straddling leaflets which occurs when one leaflet overrides the other;
- e) posterior leaflet hypoplasia which results in valvular insufficiency caused by failure of coaptation.

- Papillary muscle or chordal anomalies:
  - a) secondary chords or additional papillary muscles which tether the leaflets rendering them relatively immobile (Type III dysfunction);
  - b) parachute mitral valve which occurs when the chordae attach to a single centralised papillary muscle leading to valvular stenosis and/or regurgitation (Figure 3). This is caused by developmental failure of the ventricular trabecular muscle to properly delaminate into two distinct papillary muscles. This lesion is often associated with an atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), coarctation of the aorta or multiple left heart obstructive lesions (Shone syndrome). Parachute mitral valve presents as a spectrum of stenosis and regurgitation depending on the specific architecture of the valve (Figure 4);

- c) asymmetric dominant papillary muscles which, although similar to parachute valves, have two papillary muscles with one containing the majority of chordal fixation (usually to the posteromedial leaflet):
  - i) Type I elongated papillary muscle but normal chordae;
  - ii) Type II elongated papillary muscle with a few shortened chordae;
  - iii) Type III elongated papillary muscle with chordae attached adjacent to the annulus;
- d) mitral arcade/hammock mitral valve which occurs when the papillary muscles extend to the edges of the leaflets with short or absent chordae, resulting in stenosis and regurgitation (Figure 5).

#### • Annular anomalies:

- a) mitral rings (Figure 6) which are fibrous growths that can be supravalvular or intravalvular, and vary as regards the thickness and extent of their circumferential involvement of the valve. They can cause mitral stenosis and may be associated with an underlying anatomical abnormality causing turbulent flow through the valve. Although these may be secondary lesions, they are commonly grouped with congenital mitral valve abnormalities;
- b) isolated annular dilatation which is a secondary lesion that may occur with:
  - i) left ventricular dilatation, such as with foetal dilated cardiomyopathy;
  - ii) congenital coronary abnormalities, such as anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA).

Associated multiple ventricular septal defects (red asterisks) can also be seen.** *Images courtesy of Dr. Tara Bharucha, University Hospital Southampton, UK.*

#### 5 **What is the incidence of congenital mitral valve anomalies?**

- Mitral valve anomalies are rare, accounting for 0.4% congenital heart disease and occurring in 5/100,000 of the general population.
- Congenital mitral stenosis was reported in 1.2% of autopsied patients with congenital heart disease and 0.42% in all cardiac patients in one study. Another study found congenital mitral valve deformities in 0.6% of post-mortem patients.
- There is a male to female predominance of between 1.5-2.2:1.

#### 6 **What other congenital heart defects are associated with congenital mitral valve abnormalities?**

- In the majority (96%) of patients with mitral valve anomalies, associated defects are identified, including:
  - a) patent ductus arteriosus (PDA);
  - b) ventricular septal defect (VSD);
  - c) coarctation of the aorta;
  - d) conotruncal abnormalities;
  - e) Shone syndrome.

#### 7 **What is the pathophysiology of mitral valve disease in children?**

- A stenotic mitral valve leads to increased left atrial pressure, resulting in left atrial dilatation and hypertrophy. Increased left atrial pressure is then reflected towards the pulmonary circulation leading to pulmonary oedema, right heart overload and eventually pulmonary hypertension. Severely stenotic mitral valves may develop failure of leaflet coaptation resulting in concomitant regurgitation.
- Regurgitant mitral valves lead to increased left ventricular and left atrial volumes, resulting in dilatation and hypertrophy of these chambers to accommodate the increased flow. These structural changes contribute to elevated pulmonary vascular pressures, as well as structural abnormalities of the ventricle and its sequelae.
- Concomitant defects can affect the magnitude of mitral valve disease. For example, the physiological manifestations of elevated left atrial pressures present in congenital mitral stenosis can be alleviated by an ASD but worsened by a VSD (Figure 7).

## 8 What are the symptoms of mitral valve disease in children?

- Dyspnoea.
- Poor feeding.
- Failure to thrive.
- Wheezing and recurrent respiratory infections.
- Syncope and aphonia, secondary to compression from an enlarged left atrium.
- The clinical manifestations of congenital mitral valve disease, however, are usually overshadowed by those of concurrent complex anomalies.

#### 9 What are the signs of mitral valve disease in children?

- Patients usually have a normal peripheral vascular examination, including jugular venous pulses.
- Left ventricular dilatation may be palpable in mitral regurgitation due to enlargement of the left ventricle.

- A blowing pansystolic murmur at the apex and radiating to the axillae (but different in quality to that of a VSD) may be present in mitral regurgitation. A mid-diastolic murmur may be appreciated in mitral stenosis.
- If severe pulmonary hypertension has developed, a right ventricular heave may be present as the right ventricle hypertrophies. An accentuated second heart sound or diminished first heart sound may be identified.
- In children with heart failure, signs of low cardiac output may be present, such as tachycardia and poorly perfused extremities.

#### 10 **What are the investigative findings in patients with congenital mitral valve disease?**

- It is important to note that as mitral valve disease rarely occurs in isolation, many of the diagnostic findings may reflect a combination of structural anomalies.
- Electrocardiogram usually demonstrates sinus rhythm. In some patients, left atrial enlargement, first-degree atrioventricular nodal block, right ventricular hypertrophy (for those with pulmonary hypertension) or left ventricular enlargement (if mitral regurgitation is present) may be noted.
- Chest radiograph may demonstrate:
  - a) an increase in the angle between the bronchi, secondary to an enlarged left atrium;
  - b) pulmonary oedema and prominent pulmonary vasculature, secondary to elevated left atrial pressures;
  - c) ventricular enlargement.
- Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) which is the primary imaging modality for assessing the mitral valve in children. Two-dimensional views give detailed information about leaflet, annulus and subvalvular anatomy. Atrial and ventricular dilatation or hypertrophy may also be seen in this view. Doppler views allow accurate assessment of the presence and degree of stenosis or insufficiency (Figure 8).
- Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) which is used when more detailed information is required or if the transthoracic windows are suboptimal. It can also provide better imaging for evaluating the subvalvular apparatus. Recently, 3D echocardiography has been introduced to provide enhanced imaging of the intracardiac structures.
- Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which is another modality that provides cross-sectional imaging and can be used to assess the mitral valve. The anatomical detail of the valve itself,

**Figure 8. Echocardiographic images demonstrating a straddling mitral valve, characterised by: A) chordae tendineae attached to both sides of the interventricular septum (IVS) across a large defect, in the context of a double-outlet right ventricle (transposition of the great arteries type); and B) anomalous attachment of the anterior leaflet in the right ventricular cavity (red asterisk).

however, is not seen as well as with echocardiography. Its principal value is in assessing ventricular volumes and function.

- Cardiac catheterisation which is rarely used in children with isolated mitral disease but may be useful to delineate the anatomy when coexisting anomalies are present, such as a VSD or arch anomaly. It can be used to assess the haemodynamic consequences of mitral valve disorders, such as pulmonary hypertension, and provides the most accurate and direct assessment of the pressure gradient across a stenotic mitral valve.
- Fluoroscopy which is used to assess the functioning of implanted mechanical valves.

#### 11 **What is mitral valve prolapse?**

- Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a congenital defect in which a portion of the mitral leaflet bows outward into the left atrium.
- It usually involves the posterior leaflet and either the entire leaflet or a portion of it can be involved.
- The aetiology of MVP is thought to be related to myxomatous proliferation of the spongy layer of the leaflet and increased deposition of acid mucopolysaccharides, which creates a valve with a parachute-like shape.
- The incidence of mitral valve prolapse is 2.4% in the general population. It is usually undetected, although symptoms may emerge after several years as stress on the valve produces an anatomical deformity.

- MVP is likely an autosomal dominant trait in non-syndromal cases.
- Examples of associated syndromes include:
  - a) Marfan syndrome;
  - b) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome;
  - c) osteogenesis imperfecta;
  - d) dominant cutis laxa;
  - e) pseudoxanthoma elasticum.
- For the symptomatic patient, the prolapsing segment of leaflet crosses the coaptation line, resulting in regurgitation which can progress to symptoms of heart failure.
- Symptoms and signs include dyspnoea, fatigue, dizziness, palpitations, non-exertional chest pain and a late systolic murmur following a mid-systolic click.
- The electrocardiogram may show inverted T waves in the inferior leads and sometimes the lateral leads, as well as a prolonged QTc interval. Associated dysrhythmias include supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias.
- The chest radiograph is usually normal in a patient with MVP.
- TTE will demonstrate the prolapsing valve with or without regurgitation.
- There is no role for cardiac catheterisation specifically for MVP.
- The prognosis of MVP is usually benign and is managed by surveillance based on the presence of rhythm disturbances or symptoms.
- Complications include endocarditis, heart failure and sudden cardiac death.

#### 12 **What are the indications for surgery for congenital mitral valve stenosis?**

- Mitral valve intervention is typically indicated when symptoms are poorly tolerated or with evidence of pulmonary hypertension.
- The mitral valve continues to increase in size in the first months of life and small morphological changes in the mitral valve continue to progress as well. As such, it is advisable to delay operative intervention in neonates and infants, if possible.
- Mitral stenosis carries a five-fold greater mortality compared to mitral regurgitation and often requires earlier surgical intervention.
- In many cases, mitral valve repair, even if it does not result in normal or near-normal valve function, can be a palliative treatment until the child is old enough for a formal valve replacement.

#### 13 **What are the indications for surgery for congenital mitral regurgitation?**

• As with mitral stenosis, intervention is typically indicated when symptoms are present or progressive, or if there are secondary effects present, such as arrhythmia, progressive ventricular dilatation or pulmonary hypertension.

#### 14 **What are the non-surgical interventions available for congenital mitral valve disease?**

- Medical management for congenital mitral disease is usually limited to palliation of the symptoms and signs of heart failure. Diuretics are useful in both stenosis and regurgitation, whereas angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors may be used to treat patients with mitral regurgitation.
- Although balloon angioplasty has previously been used in rheumatic disease of the mitral valve, experience with its use in congenital mitral stenosis is limited.

#### 15 **What are the principles of surgery for congenital mitral stenosis?**

- Congenital mitral stenosis is generally more difficult to manage surgically than acquired mitral stenosis given the unusual and variable valvular anatomy.
- Valve reconstruction involves selecting a strategy specific to anatomy of the individual patient, as there is a large degree of variation.
- Valve repair is strongly preferred over replacement, if an adequate result can be obtained.
- The mitral valve can be exposed using a vertical transatrial septal incision, a transverse atrial septal incision or a left atrial incision at the interatrial groove, with or without division of the superior vena cava (SVC).
- In some cases, the posterior leaflet is detached from the annulus in order to access and repair the subvalvular apparatus, such as splitting or fenestration of the papillary muscles or chordae, as with repair of the parachute valve (Figure 9). This can be followed by patch leaflet augmentation and reattachment of the leaflet (Figures 10 and 11).
- The fibroelastic layer of thickened leaflets can be sharply dissected off the remaining leaflet in a technique similar to endarterectomy.

**Figure 11. Postoperative echocardiographic images following patch augmentation of the posterior leaflet (asterisk) on: A) a transoesophageal long-axis view demonstrating good depth of coaptation; and B) a transthoracic apical three-chamber view demonstrating a competent and unobstructed valve.**

• Supramitral and intramitral rings are directly excised, although intramitral rings have the additional difficulty of direct leaflet involvement (Figures 12 and 13).

**Figure 12. Supramitral rings: A) a band-type ring, which is adherent to the valve leaflets and results in a restrictive effect; B) a membrane-type ring, which is usually above the annular level, clearly visible and results in an obstructive effect.**

**Figure 13. Excision of a membrane-type supramitral ring, with a combination of sharp and blunt dissection.**

• Although supra-annular valve replacement is a technique that allows a prosthetic valve to be placed in a smaller annulus, this extraanatomical positioning is associated with worse immediate and longterm results.

#### 16 **How is congenital mitral regurgitation surgically repaired?**

- As with mitral stenosis, repair is strongly preferred over replacement if possible, even if reoperation is required later in life.
- Specific repair techniques vary dependent on the aetiology of the regurgitation and the valve morphology, and are not as standardised as those used in repair of acquired mitral regurgitation:
  - a) annuloplasty is frequently required and can be achieved by using pericardium which avoids the use of prosthetic material. Prosthetic ring annuloplasty may reduce the need for reoperation but cannot be used in infants and smaller children because it will restrict growth of the valve. Partial annuloplasty is preferable in growing paediatric patients and support can be achieved with pericardium, xenograft, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or felt (Figure 14);

![](_page_16_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 14. Surgical mitral valve repair using: A) a bilateral isolated commissuroplasty, which provides reduction of the anteroposterior diameter; and B) a posterior annuloplasty, which provides reduction of both the lateral and anteroposterior diameters.**

- b) chordae tendineae can be reconstructed with PTFE;
- c) a cleft mitral valve is repaired by suturing the leaflet tissue together using running or interrupted sutures, with an annuloplasty added if there is residual regurgitation after the cleft is closed (Figure 15);

![](_page_16_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Figure 15. Surgical repair of a cleft anterior mitral valve leaflet using interrupted sutures.**

- d) elongated chordae can be shortened or transferred;
- e) elongated papillary muscles can be shortened or reconstructed.
- Concomitant congenital repairs can safely be performed at the same operation.

#### 17 **What are the options for replacing the mitral valve in children (Figure 16)?**

• Bioprosthetic and homograft valves are composed of tissue material and thus do not require long-term anticoagulation. The disadvantage

![](_page_17_Figure_7.jpeg)

**Figure 16. Management algorithm for mitral valve anomalies. MV = mitral valve; 2VC = two-ventricle circulation.** *Courtesy of Dr. Tara Bharucha, University Hospital Southampton, UK.*

- of these valves is accelerated degeneration in children compared to adults, necessitating a later operative replacement.
- Mechanical valves require long-term anticoagulation but are durable and have few thromboembolic events. As the child grows, these valves will need to be replaced again until adult size is achieved. Although bleeding events are scarce in the paediatric population, managing anticoagulation in children can be a formidable challenge.
- The Melody® valve (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) is a catheterdelivered bovine venous valve mounted on a stent. Although traditionally used for percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement, more recently, it has been adapted for replacement of the mitral valve using an open surgical approach. A theoretical advantage over other valve prostheses is the ability to dilate the valve via cardiac catheterisation as the child grows, decreasing the frequency of redo operative valve replacements.
- The Ross II mitral valve replacement involves transposing the native pulmonary valve onto the native mitral annulus followed by pulmonary valve replacement with a homograft. In this case, the autograft is secured within a prosthetic tube graft before it is sutured to the mitral annulus. The advantage of this procedure is avoiding anticoagulation and potentially less structural valve deterioration than with a manufactured bioprosthetic valve. The valve, however, does not grow with the child.

#### 18 **What are the risks and potential complications of surgery on the mitral valve in children (Table 2)?**

- The risks common to all mitral valve surgery in children include heart block requiring a pacemaker, endocarditis and stroke.
- With mitral valve repair, there is a risk of residual stenosis or regurgitation which can progress and may require reoperation. Intraoperative TOE can help guide the need for immediate re-repair and improve results.
- Potential complications of mitral valve replacement include prosthetic valve thrombosis, haemolysis, perivalvular leak, thromboembolism, endocarditis, complications related to anticoagulation in the case of mechanical valves and the need for redo replacement of the valve due to growth and structural valve deterioration.
- Valve replacement can lead to mismatch with annulus size, which is a predictor of early and late death. Prosthetic valves that are too large for the patient's annulus can also have a negative impact on survival.

#### 19 **What are the long-term outcomes for children with congenital mitral valve disease?**

- Results of mitral valve surgery in children vary significantly with the underlying anatomy.
- Mitral stenosis compared to mitral regurgitation has been shown to be a risk factor for late heart failure and persistent mitral valve dysfunction. Parachute mitral valve is a risk factor for a worse longterm outcome.
- Congenital mitral valve repair within the first year of life is a risk factor for persistent mitral valve dysfunction.
- For mitral regurgitation, valve repair compared with replacement results in lower rates of heart block, thromboembolism and endocarditis (Figures 17 and 18).
- For mitral stenosis, 10-year survival is 40% with medical management and 56% with surgical management. Mitral regurgitation carries a better overall prognosis than mitral stenosis.
- At the age of 19, the freedom from mitral valve replacement is 82% and freedom from repeat interventions is 91% in patients undergoing mitral valve repair for congenital and acquired mitral valve disease.

#### 20 **Describe the procedures that are being developed or investigated for the management of congenital mitral valve disease**

- The use of less invasive alternatives to operative intervention is a common theme among many specialties, including congenital heart surgery. The Melody® valve is an example of a catheter-based technology that has demonstrated some applicability to mitral valve replacement, and carries the potential benefits of reduced morbidity similar to that of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in adults. The ability to expand the valve percutaneously instead of operative valve replacement may prove to be advantageous.
- Imaging modalities continue to improve which leads to better operative planning and characterisation of anomalies at an earlier stage with better accuracy.
- Efforts are also focused on developing tissue-engineered valves and repair materials that will allow for potential growth with the patient, thereby avoiding long-term anticoagulation and relatively frequent valve replacements.
