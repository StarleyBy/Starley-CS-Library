# Transposition of the great arteries

**Shafi Mussa, Pascal Vouhé**

## 1 **What is transposition of the great arteries?**

• Transposition of the great arteries (TGA or transposition) is a congenital arrangement in which the ventriculoarterial connections are discordant, which means that the aorta arises entirely or largely from the right ventricle and the pulmonary trunk arises entirely or largely from the left ventricle. In this definition, atrioventricular connections are concordant (Figure 1).

**Figure 1. A) Normal heart; and B) ventriculo-arterial discordance, with the left ventricle and pulmonary artery outlined in red, and the right ventricle and aorta outlined in blue.**

- Transposition can be associated with a broad spectrum of complex cardiac anomalies, including functional single ventricle, double-outlet ventricles, double-inlet ventricles, but this chapter concentrates on transposition as the sole or dominant condition.
- It is customary to refer to 'simple' transposition or transposition for the condition in which the interventricular septum is intact and there is no obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT).

#### 2 **What are the main anatomical features of hearts with transposed arteries?**

- Atrial anatomy and arrangement tend to be normal.
- Often, the fossa ovalis membrane is thin and easily broken during balloon septostomy.
- The anatomy of the conduction system is also normal with the sinoatrial node, atrioventricular node and bundle of His in the expected position.
- Ventricular anatomy can vary slightly with a straighter septum, and the pulmonary valve less wedged between the mitral and tricuspid valve, as seen in an atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD).
- The right (subaortic) infundibulum is entirely muscular, while the left (subpulmonic) infundibulum presents with a pulmonary-mitral continuity. When a ventricular septal defect is present, this can vary.
- The relationship between the aorta and pulmonary trunk can vary greatly. While in the majority of cases with normal atrial arrangement and an intact interventricular septum, the aorta is anterior and to the right of the pulmonary trunk, it can be seen to the left (as in a mirrorimage variant), or right-sided but posterior.

#### 3 **What are the main anatomical features of the coronary arteries in transposition of the great arteries?**

- In TGA, the distribution of the proximal coronary arteries as they emerge from the aorta is variable, with a number of commonly found patterns.
- These coronary artery patterns were first described by Yacoub but the later Leiden classification is more commonly used.
- The Leiden classification is descriptive and uses a convention whereby the aortic sinuses facing or closest to the pulmonary artery are numbered 1 for the rightward sinus and 2 for the leftward sinus. The classification then describes which of the sinuses the three major coronary artery branches originate. This classification does not account for the position of the coronary arteries in relation to the main vessels, intramural course, or number of coronary ostia within the sinus (Figure 2).

![](_page_2_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 2. Coronary artery pattern classification with the Leiden system. Irrespective of the relative position of the great arteries, sinuses 1 and 2 can always be identified and the origin of the coronary arteries assigned accordingly. With the observer in the non-adjacent sinus of the aortic valve and looking at the pulmonary artery, the sinus to the right is called 1 (blue colour) and the one to the left is called 2 (red colour). Coronary origins are then described using the main vessel initial, such as 1L,2RCx which describes anatomy where the left anterior descending coronary artery originates from sinus 1, and the right and circumflex coronary arteries originate from sinus 2. This means the circumflex artery will be running along a posterior loop behind the pulmonary trunk. 1LCx,2R describes anatomy where the left main coronary artery system originates from sinus 1 and the right coronary artery originates from sinus 2. All arteries are therefore anterior to the pulmonary trunk. In 1LCxR, all three vessels originate from sinus 1, with the right coronary artery looping anterior to the aortic root.**

- From a surgical point of view, it is useful to classify coronary artery patterns into three groups:
  - a) 'usual' coronary arteries (70% of cases) where the left and right coronary arteries emerge from separate aortic sinuses, and the left coronary artery divides into the left anterior descending and the circumflex arteries. Coronary transfer is usually easy;
  - b) coronary artery patterns with a posterior loop and/or anterior loop (25% of cases). Coronary transfer may be difficult;

- c) coronary artery patterns with the arteries coursing between the great arteries, often associated with an intramural course (5% of cases). Coronary transfer is usually difficult (Figure 3).
- The proximal course of the coronary arteries may be seen on echocardiography but delineating the distribution precisely can be challenging.

Figure 3. Diagrammatic representation of the coronary artery patterns in transposition of the great arteries, with the aorta being the anterior vessel and pulmonary artery the posterior vessel: A) 'usual' pattern — where the left and right coronary arteries (RCA) emerge from separate aortic sinuses, and the left coronary artery bifurcates into the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and circumflex (Cx) branches; B) posterior loop pattern — where the circumflex coronary artery is a branch of the right coronary artery and has to pass posterior to the pulmonary artery in order to reach the left atrioventricular groove; C) intramural coronary artery — where the left coronary artery typically has a slit-like ostium, often located eccentrically within an aortic sinus, which may also subtend the right coronary artery. The left coronary artery then passes obliquely through the wall of the aorta for a variable distance, often emerging from between the great arteries before bifurcating into its terminal branches.

# 4 Describe the anatomy and significance of an intramural coronary artery

- Intramural coronary arteries occur in approximately 5% of all cases of TGA and have a proximal course that runs within the wall of the aorta.
- They often have a narrow slit-like ostium that may be located very close to an aortic valve commissure. Moreover, the intramural course is often behind or in close proximity to a commissure, thus requiring

- reimplantation of the neopulmonary valve leaflets after harvesting of the coronary button, increasing the risk of neopulmonary regurgitation.
- They are of surgical significance because they present a technical challenge during the arterial switch operation, making it more difficult to harvest and relocate coronary buttons.
- In some large studies, an intramural course and single coronary ostium pattern have been identified as the two independent risk factors for increased mortality in the arterial switch operation.

#### 5 **Describe the classification of transposition of the great arteries**

- The most commonly used classification of transposition refers to transposition as the sole or dominant condition, though some anomalies are considered part of this classification.
- The association of those anomalies can significantly affect clinical presentation, timing and strategy of surgical repair.
- The prevalence of associated lesions is relatively uniform:
  - a) transposition with intact ventricular septum (TGA) 75%;
  - b) ventricular septal defect (TGA-VSD) 15%;
  - c) pulmonary/subpulmonary stenosis (TGA-PS) 6%;
  - d) coarctation of the aorta (TGA-CoA) 4%.
- It is worth noting, however, that ventriculo-arterial discordance can be seen in the context of complex malformations. These are discussed in the relevant chapters:
  - a) tricuspid or mitral atresia;
  - b) double-inlet left or right ventricle (DILV/DIRV);
  - c) atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD);
  - d) double-outlet right ventricle (DORV), with or without pulmonary stenosis (PS);
  - e) TGA with left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction;
  - f) DORV, subpulmonary VSD, CoA (Taussig-Bing anomaly);
  - g) discordant atrioventricular connection (or double discordancy, or congenitally corrected TGA).

#### 6 **What is the epidemiology of simple transposition of the great arteries?**

• Transposition of the great arteries is a common lesion that accounts for 2% of all congenital heart defects.

- There is an increased incidence in males with a ratio of approximately 2:1.
- There is no particular geographical distribution.

#### 7 **What is the pathophysiology of transposition of the great arteries?**

- In transposition, the systemic and pulmonary circulations are in parallel (disconnected), rather than being in series (the normal arrangement).
- The systemic venous return (deoxygenated blood) passes into the right atrium and right ventricle and is then pumped into the systemic arterial vascular bed via the aorta (thus bypassing the lungs). The pulmonary venous return (oxygenated blood) passes into the left atrium and ventricle, and is then pumped into the pulmonary arterial vascular bed via the pulmonary artery (Figure 4).

![](_page_5_Figure_7.jpeg)

**Figure 4. A) Normal circulation showing the systemic and pulmonary circulations in series. B) Circulation in transposition of the great arteries, with the left ventricle supplying the pulmonary vasculature and right ventricle supplying the systemic vasculature. The two systems are disconnected from each other and require shunting to ensure survival.**

- In simple transposition, this complete separation of the two systems is incompatible with life, where survival can only be ensured by the presence of one or more communications between the systemic and pulmonary circulations.
- 8 **How can blood flow between the systemic and pulmonary circulations in transposition of the great arteries (Figure 5)?**
- Blood can potentially mix between the systemic and pulmonary circulations at three levels, by virtue of extracardiac and intracardiac communications, including:
  - a) patent ductus arteriosus (PDA);
  - b) interatrial communications (patent foramen ovale PFO, secundum atrial septal defect, and rarely, atrioventricular septal defect);
  - c) interventricular communications (ventricular septal defect).

![](_page_6_Figure_8.jpeg)

**Figure 5. Potential sites of mixing between the systemic and pulmonary circulations in patients with transposition of the great arteries include between the atria, ventricles, or great arteries themselves.**

- The PDA and PFO are anatomical shunts present in the foetal circulation that persist beyond childbirth, whereas a VSD is a pathological shunt.
- The most mixing can occur between the atria (interatrial communication), followed by mixing between the great arteries (patent ductus arteriosus), with some mixing possible between the ventricles if there is a ventricular septal defect.

# 9 **Describe 'transposition physiology'**

- This represents a situation where the patient is clinically cyanosed despite there being excessive pulmonary blood flow.
- In the newborn, with a patent ductus arteriosus and high pulmonary vascular resistance, oxygen saturations in the ascending aorta are typically lower than those in the main pulmonary artery. Post-ductal saturations will be proportionally higher, however, due to pulmonary to systemic shunting.
- As the pulmonary vascular resistance drops, pre-ductal and postductal saturations will be similar due to reduced shunting.
- In the presence of an associated pre-ductal obstructive lesion in the aortic arch (such as coarctation), significant reverse differential cyanosis is seen (pre-ductal saturations lower than post-ductal saturations), due to a pulmonary-dependent circulation in the descending aorta.
- The physiological fall in pulmonary vascular resistance after birth leads to a systemic to pulmonary shunt via the patent ductus arteriosus and increased pulmonary blood flow. As the pulmonary vascular resistance continues to fall, the magnitude of the shunt will increase.
- Closure of the ductus arteriosus (usually by day of life) can lead to reduced mixing and in the case of a restrictive interatrial communication, profound cyanosis.
- An intact interatrial septum often produces a cardiac emergency soon after birth, with profound cyanosis and low systemic output, even if the ductus arteriosus remains patent.
- If the interatrial communication is large, closure of the ductus arteriosus may not have an immediate significant effect on oxygen saturations, as adequate mixing between the two circulations will occur at atrial level.
- As the pulmonary vascular resistance continues to fall, deconditioning of the left ventricle ensues, with reduction of the ventricular mass. Eventually, the LV may no longer be able to generate systemic pressure or pump against systemic vascular resistance.

• The presence of a ventricular septal defect will enable the left ventricular pressure to be maintained, and therefore protects against ventricular deconditioning.

#### 10 **Describe the clinical presentation of children with transposition of the great arteries**

- In the developed world, the diagnosis is often made prenatally as part of a foetal anomaly screening programme. In the UK, around 80% of TGA are diagnosed prenatally.
- Children born with a prenatal diagnosis of TGA are managed from birth to ensure adequate mixing of blood between the systemic and pulmonary circulations.
- Those children born without a prenatal diagnosis will often be cyanosed. The degree of cyanosis will depend on the size of the communications between the systemic and pulmonary circulations (ductus arteriosus, interatrial, and interventricular communications).
- Children born with an inadequate atrial communication will be profoundly cyanosed when the ductus arteriosus closes and will present in the first few days of life. In addition, the circulation may fail acutely with a resultant shock state of poor tissue perfusion, tachycardia, hypotension and tachypnoea.
- The presence of an adequate atrial communication will ensure that the child will have mild desaturation only, but will develop signs of pulmonary over-circulation (tachypnoea, poor weight gain) and will likely present at a few weeks of age.

#### 11 **What is the natural history of transposition of the great arteries?**

- In TGA with intact ventricular septum by 6 weeks of age, the physiological fall in pulmonary vascular resistance leads to both involution of the left ventricle (which is pumping against decreasing afterload) and excessive pulmonary blood flow.
- The left ventricle loses its normal spherical configuration and becomes thin-walled and crescentic in shape.
- Pulmonary blood flow can increase up to four times that of systemic blood flow, with consequent development of irreversible pulmonary vascular disease by 12 months of age.
- In the presence of a ventricular septal defect, the pressure in the left ventricle is maintained, and thus the ventricle does not involute.
- However, the pressure and volume loading of the pulmonary circulation leads to the development of aggressive, irreversible pulmonary vascular disease by approximately 6 months of age.

- Without treatment, the condition is therefore life-threatening and over 90% of children born with TGA will die before 1 year of age. The association of a restrictive interatrial communication or intact atrial septum is invariably lethal within the first few days of life.
- 12 **Describe the radiographic features of <sup>a</sup> patient with transposition of the great arteries**
- The typical radiographic appearance of TGA includes:
  - a) narrow superior mediastinal contour (reflecting the anteroposterior relationship of the great arteries);
  - b) enlarged cardiac silhouette (volume loaded heart);
  - c) plethoric lung fields (excessive pulmonary blood flow).
- This is described as an "egg-on-its-side" or "egg-on-a-string" appearance (Figure 6).

- 13 **What are the electrocardiographic features of <sup>a</sup> patient with transposition of the great arteries?**
- The electrocardiogram (ECG) in the newborn is most often normal.

- Signs of right ventricular hypertrophy with right axis deviation may be seen in infants prior to surgical repair.
- In the context of complex lesions, the ECG may reflect other anomalies, such as superior axis deviation associated with anomalies of the tricuspid valve.

#### 14 **What are the echocardiographic features of <sup>a</sup> patient with transposition of the great arteries?**

• The hallmark feature of TGA on echocardiography is parallel great vessels, with the pulmonary artery (bifurcating vessel) extending from the left ventricle and the aorta (with coronary arteries and supraaortic branches) extending from the right ventricle (Figure 7).

• To aid pre-operative management, it is important to establish the presence and size of a ductus arteriosus, interatrial communication or ventricular septal defect (Figure 8).

B) Pulsed-wave Doppler interrogation demonstrating significant flow acceleration (approximately 1.8m/sec).** *Images courtesy of Dr. Tara Bharucha, University Hospital Southampton, UK.*

- To aid surgical planning, it is important to establish the:
  - a) relationship between the great vessels (predominantly anteroposterior or side-by-side) (Figure 9);
  - b) distribution of the coronary arteries (Figure 10);
  - c) ventricular function;
  - d) adequacy of the right and left ventricular outflow tracts;
  - e) presence of aortic arch abnormalities (Figure 11).

#### 15 **Describe the role of other imaging techniques in <sup>a</sup> patient with transposition of the great arteries**

- In contemporary practice, echocardiography remains the mainstay of diagnostic imaging in the neonatal age and in the pre-operative setting.
- This is particularly true in cases of simple transposition.
- Although, cardiac catheterisation and cross-sectional imaging are rarely used pre-operatively, there are some circumstances, however, in which these modalities are useful and regularly used.
- Cardiac catheterisation is used in the peri-operative setting to exclude coronary anatomical problems, especially in cases of haemodynamic instability or poor ventricular function that cannot be explained otherwise. This can be performed with or without support but the need for mechanical support following arterial switch poses a strong indication for assessment of the coronary arterial tree.

- Post-surgical repair, percutaneous arterioplasty (with or without stenting of the pulmonary arteries) is often used.
- CT scanning with 3D reconstructions and MRI are particularly useful and often the investigation of choice in follow-up (Figures 12-14).

• These can be used to demonstrate the complications of atrial baffles following an atrial switch operation, as part of the work-up for chest pain, persistent depression of ventricular function and for other complications, such as pulmonary branch stenosis or aortic root dilatation.

#### 16 **What are the principles of managing <sup>a</sup> patient with transposition of the great arteries?**

- Initially, a prostaglandin infusion is established to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus, enabling increased left atrial loading and therefore mixing of blood between the systemic and pulmonary circulations.
- If the child remains significantly cyanosed (oxygen saturations <75%) despite maintaining ductal patency, the next step is to improve mixing at the atrial level by performing a balloon atrial septostomy.
- The child may need ventilatory and inotropic support until a septostomy is performed.
- The haemodynamic state and gas exchange should improve following atrial septostomy, such that inotropic and ventilatory support can be weaned, and the child can be extubated and stabilised prior to definitive treatment.
- Adequate mixing at atrial level should also enable the prostaglandin infusion to be discontinued, although if saturations are inadequate it

is reasonable to continue the infusion and promote mixing at ductal level.

# 17 **Describe the principles of <sup>a</sup> balloon atrial septostomy**

- A balloon atrial septostomy is a catheter-based intervention designed to improve mixing of blood at the atrial level by creating or enlarging a communication in the interatrial septum.
- It was first performed by William Rashkind, an American radiologist, under fluoroscopic guidance.
- A balloon-tipped catheter is passed across the interatrial septum from the right atrium to the left atrium. Following inflation of the balloon in the left atrium, the balloon is pulled back through the atrial septum, thus enlarging the interatrial communication.
- In contemporary practice, the procedure is often performed at the bedside using echocardiographic guidance, either under sedation or general anaesthesia (Figure 15).

![](_page_16_Figure_8.jpeg)

**Figure 15. Neonatal balloon septostomy on a neonate with transposition of the great arteries. Access is obtained via the right femoral vein: A) a balloon tip catheter is inflated in the left atrium (LA) via the small atrial communication; B) the inflated balloon is then quickly drawn back into the right atrium (RA), tearing the fossa ovalis membrane in the process; C) the balloon, now in the right atrium, is deflated;. D) the adequacy of septostomy is verified on Doppler echocardiography.** *Images courtesy of Dr. Trevor Richens, University Hospital Southampton, UK.*

- The procedure relieves hypoxaemia, increases oxygen saturation levels and reduces oxygen requirement, although many patients need to continue on a prostaglandin infusion to maintain oxygen saturation.
- In addition to the complications associated with vascular access in neonates, complications include arrhythmias, cardiac perforation, balloon fragment embolisation, laceration of the atrioventricular valves and systemic or pulmonary veins.
- There have been reports of association between balloon atrial septostomy and pre-operative neurological injury, but other studies have not corroborated this finding and demonstrated that hypoxaemia and longer time to surgical correction are associated with pre-operative neurological injury.

#### 18 **Describe the principles of surgery for transposition of the great arteries**

- Physiological repairs or atrial switch operations (Senning or Mustard procedures) aim to re-establish a coherent blood flow, whereby pulmonary venous return is redirected into the systemic circulation and the systemic venous return into the pulmonary circulation. These repairs do not correct the underlying malformation (ventriculo-arterial discordance) but rather the left and right ventricles remain physiologically inverted. To complete the repair, all shunts and obstructions are closed and repaired.
- Anatomical repairs (arterial switch operations) aim to re-establish a coherent blood flow, whereby pulmonary venous return is redirected into the systemic circulation and the systemic venous return into the pulmonary circulation. The physiological goal, however, is achieved by repairing the underlying ventriculo-arterial discordance, thus re-establishing the correct anatomical configuration. In addition, all shunts and obstructions are closed and repaired.
- In patients with complex transposition, surgical options may include anatomical or physiological repairs, but often a combination of the two or even alternative solutions to address the additional cardiac lesions.

### 19 **What are the principles of an atrial switch operation?**

- Atrial switch operations result in the:
  - a) systemic venous return (deoxygenated blood from the superior and inferior vena cavae) being directed through the mitral valve and left ventricle into the pulmonary artery;

- b) pulmonary venous return (oxygenated blood from the pulmonary veins) being directed through the tricuspid valve and right ventricle into the aorta.
- The right ventricle thus remains as the systemic ventricle and the left ventricle pumps into the pulmonary circulation.
- This is accomplished by rerouting the blood flow in the atria either by the use of a baffle (Mustard procedure) (Figure 16), or the native atrial tissue (Senning procedure) (Figure 17).

![](_page_18_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Figure 16. Illustration of the atrial pericardial baffle used in the Mustard procedure, and the direction of blood flow resulting from intracardiac repair. SVC = superior vena cava; IVC = inferior vena cava; RA = right atrium; LA = left atrium; RV = right ventricle; LV = left ventricle.**

- Typically, the operations were performed when infants were over 3 months of age or weigh over 5kg. The operations were effective in the short term and were performed with a relatively low mortality.
- Although mortality with the atrial switch procedures was low, morbidity was a major concern. Short-term complications include obstruction of the systemic venous return pathway and/or leak of blood across the intra-atrial baffle. Longer-term complications include tricuspid valve regurgitation, systemic right ventricular dysfunction, sinus node dysfunction and atrial arrhythmias (Figure 18).
- The first successful anatomical repair (arterial switch operation) was performed by Jatene in 1975. The initial concern with anatomical repair was a high operative mortality. Technical refinements and improvements in cardiopulmonary bypass and intensive care management for neonates led to better outcomes. It then became clear that the ongoing morbidity following anatomical repair was considerably lower than the morbidity following physiological repair. Physiological repairs were superseded by the arterial switch operation when it became apparent that the anatomical repair could consistently be performed with a low mortality.
- Atrial switch procedures are almost never undertaken for TGA in contemporary practice but are an alternative surgical option that may be considered in late presentations with an involuted left ventricle, or with particularly challenging coronary anatomy.

• There remains a cohort of adults with TGA repaired by atrial switch followed up in adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) clinics, many living with and requiring treatment for the sequelae of physiological repairs.

#### 20 **What are the principles of an arterial switch operation (Figure 19)?**

- Following a median sternotomy, a generous patch of autologous pericardium is harvested.
- Standard bypass is established with a single atrial cannula or bicaval cannulation, depending on the need to repair any large atrial or ventricular septal defects.
- Moderate hypothermia is widely used and cardioplegia is always employed.
- The ductus arteriosus is ligated and divided. Extensive dissection and mobilisation of the branch pulmonary arteries is paramount to avoid postoperative sequelae, such as branch pulmonary artery stenosis.

**Figure 19. Operative images demonstrating repair of simple transposition: A) cardiopulmonary bypass is set up with standard bicaval cannulation, an arterial cannula in the proximal arch and a root cannula for cardioplegia. The aorta is being clamped; B) following cardioplegic arrest, the aortic root is divided, suspended and inspected; C) the main pulmonary artery is divided at the bifurcation and the Lecompte manoeuvre is completed by repositioning the bifurcation above the ascending aorta; D) both coronary ostia are harvested with the respective sinus in a button shape; E) a patch of autologous pericardium is prepared and shaped to repair the neopulmonary artery; F) once repaired, the neopulmonary root is retracted to test for valve competency; G) both coronary ostia are implanted on the anterior surface of the neoaortic root and the aortic cross-clamp is released; H) the neopulmonary trunk is reconstructed with a patch-tobifurcation anastomosis, in this case with an additional patch to avoid distortion. NeoPV = neopulmonary valve; PAs = pulmonary arteries; Ao = aorta; LMCA = left main coronary artery; RCA = right coronary artery; RV = right ventricle; RA = right atrium; MPA = main pulmonary artery.**

- The aorta is transected 5-10mm distal to the coronary ostia and the main pulmonary artery transected just proximal to its bifurcation.
- The pulmonary bifurcation is then translocated in front of the aorta (known as a French or Lecompte manoeuver) and retracted.
- The coronary sinuses 1 and 2 (as per the Leiden classification) containing the ostia are inspected for position and shape of the ostia. Any intramural course is excluded or evaluated, if present.
- The sinuses are completely excised from the aorta. In cases with an intramural course, the intramural tract is unroofed. The procedure may require dissection of the commissure and its subsequent resuspension.
- The proximal few millimetres of the coronaries are mobilised with careful dissection.
- The neopulmonary trunk is reconstructed with the patch of autologous pericardium, appropriately shaped, and the pulmonary valve resuspended.
- The sinuses are shaped into coronary buttons and reimplanted onto the neoaortic root, using:
  - a) an open technique where the coronary buttons are first implanted followed by reconstruction of the aortic continuity;
  - b) a closed technique where the aorta is reconstructed first and followed by implantation of the coronary buttons;
  - c) a combination of the two.
- The neopulmonary trunk is reimplanted onto the pulmonary bifurcation creating the 'neopulmonary artery'.
- Closure of the interatrial communication and repair of the VSD are carried out at a convenient point during the procedure.
- Repair of any coarctation or aortic arch anomaly in patients with more complex transposition is usually carried out before the switch procedure and is almost invariably performed under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.

#### 21 **Are there any coronary artery patterns that are not amenable to an arterial switch operation?**

- Although there are no coronary artery patterns that have been found to be a contraindication to an arterial switch operation, there are some that present a greater surgical challenge, including:
  - a) 1LR,2Cx with the RCA arching in front of the neopulmonary artery;
  - b) 1LRCx or 2LRCx or single coronary artery;

- c) intramural coronary arteries;
- d) coronary arrangements in the context of a side-by-side orientation of the transposed vessels.
- Modifications to the arterial switch operation to accommodate these more challenging coronary patterns have been successfully performed and described.

#### 22 **When should an arterial switch operation be performed?**

- The timing of the arterial switch operation depends on the anatomy, the clinical state of the child, and the following general principles.
- For TGA with intact ventricular septum in a child of term gestational age, provided that there is adequate mixing of blood and the child is maintaining oxygen saturation levels in the high 80s or above, the arterial switch operation should be performed by 2 weeks of age.
- Commonly, repair is performed as soon as the PVR starts dropping, usually around the 5-7th day of life.
- Delaying surgery beyond 6 weeks of age is associated with considerable additional risks due to the possibility of left ventricular involution.
- For patients with TGA with VSD, a left ventricle subjected to systemic pressures by virtue of an unrestrictive VSD will not involute. Hence, there is less of an urgency to perform an arterial switch operation. As the pulmonary vascular resistance drops, however, increased shunting of blood may result in heart failure and surgery should be performed before this occurs.
- For patients with TGA and a restrictive VSD, with a pressure gradient across the VSD, the management is similar to those with TGA with intact ventricular septum, as the left ventricle is not subject to systemic pressures and can involute.
- For complex TGA with aortic arch hypoplasia, the timing of surgery is governed by the need to address the arch abnormality, usually within the first week of life.

#### 23 **What are the specific postoperative complications following an arterial switch operation?**

- The most frequent complication, as well as cause of death, following an arterial switch operation is low cardiac output syndrome.
- This is usually related to poor coronary blood flow, resulting in myocardial ischaemia and can be detected by:
  - a) abnormal myocardial perfusion immediately after aortic unclamping;

- b) signs of ischaemia on the ECG and rising left atrial pressure;
- c) echocardiographic evidence of regional deterioration of ventricular function;
- d) postoperative angiography (Figure 20).
- The management involves emergency re-exploration of the transferred coronary arteries to diagnose and address any kinking, external compression or anastomotic concerns.
- ECMO may be necessary until recovery of ventricular function occurs.
- Occasionally, low cardiac output is related to the inability of the left ventricle to sustain systemic output, especially in neonates with TGA-IVS beyond weeks of age. This is suspected where there is normal coronary perfusion (eventually confirmed by coronary angiography) and echocardiographic global deterioration of ventricular function. In these patients, the management involves delayed sternal closure, inotropic support and ECMO.

#### 24 **What are the outcomes following the arterial switch operation?**

- Generally, the outcomes following the arterial switch operation are excellent with early survival rates exceeding 96% in most reported large series. In the UK, almost 99% survival has been reported over the past 3 years for simple transposition repair.
- Risk factors for early death include:
  - a) low weight (<2.5kg) at the time of surgery;
  - b) presence of complex anatomy (aortic arch hypoplasia, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction).
- Most early deaths occur due to myocardial ischaemia.
- Survival beyond the early period is excellent with reported actuarial survival rates of >95% at 10 years and beyond.
- The longest follow-up studies contain data on patients undergoing the arterial switch operation over 25 years ago and demonstrate consistently excellent survival rates with little attrition over time.
- Most late deaths also occur due to myocardial ischaemia.

#### 25 **What are the long-term consequences following an arterial switch operation?**

- Almost all patients surviving following the arterial switch operation remain in sinus rhythm (94%) and in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional Class I (97-99%).
- Approximately 10% of the patients undergo surgical or catheterbased reintervention during the first 10 years following the arterial switch operation, with the most frequent indications being:
  - a) coronary artery lesions (5%) which are very often silent and therefore identified by routine coronary evaluation;
  - b) stenoses of the pulmonary arteries which are often amenable to catheter-based dilatation (Figure 21);
  - c) progressive dilatation of the neoaortic root which is associated with aortic regurgitation.
- There is increasing interest in the functional and neuropsychological outcomes of those patients who have undergone neonatal arterial switch operations, with documented impairment in visual-spatial and fine-motor function in childhood and increased incidence of psychiatric disorders (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression and anxiety) in older patients.
