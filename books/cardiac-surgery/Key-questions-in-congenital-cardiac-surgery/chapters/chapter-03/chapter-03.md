#### 36 **What are the pharmacological properties of muscle relaxants?**

- Mechanism of action: muscle relaxants act by specific blockade of the neuromuscular junction, such that it enables light anaesthesia to be used with adequate relaxation of the muscles of the abdomen and diaphragm. They also relax the vocal cords and allow the passage of a tracheal tube. They are subdivided into:
  - a) non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking agents which compete with acetylcholine for receptor sites at the neuromuscular junction. Their action can be reversed with anticholinesterases, such as neostigmine, and can be divided into:
    - i) aminosteroid group such as pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium;
    - ii) benzylisoquinolinium group such as atracurium, cisatracurium and mivacurium;
  - b) depolarising neuromuscular blocking agents. An example is suxamethonium chloride, which has the most rapid onset of action of any of the neuromuscular blocking drugs and is ideal if a fast onset and brief duration of action are required, such as with tracheal intubation. Neonates and young children are less sensitive to suxamethonium chloride and a higher dose may be required. Unlike the non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking drugs, its action cannot be reversed and recovery is spontaneous. Anticholinesterases, such as neostigmine, potentiate the neuromuscular block.

- Dose:
  - a) suxamethonium (intravenous injection):
    - i) neonate: 2mg/kg;
    - ii) child (1-11 months): 2mg/kg;
    - iii) child (1-17 years): 1mg/kg;
  - b) rocuronium initially 600μg/kg IV, then 300-600μg/kg/hour IV infusion, adjusted according to response.
