#### What is the definition of a univentricular heart?

- Univentricular heart is a term that is used to describe a wide range
  of congenital heart lesions where both atria are connected entirely or
  almost entirely to a single functional ventricle. It is also known as a
  single-ventricle heart or a functionally single ventricle.
- In the vast majority of cases, univentricular heart refers to a functional, rather than anatomical condition, as a second rudimentary ventricle is usually present. It is exceedingly rare to have only one (solitary) ventricle.
- In some instances, however, there are two well-developed ventricles but it is not possible to render the heart into a normal biventricular configuration, such as in a patient with a large ventricular septal defect (VSD) and straddling atrioventricular valves.
- The International Society for Nomenclature of Paediatric and Congenital Heart Disease (ISNPCHD) defines a univentricular heart as "a spectrum of cardiovascular malformations in which the ventricular mass may not readily lend itself to partitioning that commits one ventricular pump to the systemic circulation, and another to the pulmonary circulation".

# What are the common causes of a functionally univentricular heart (Figure 1)?

- Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS).
- Hypoplastic right heart (HRH).
- Tricuspid atresia (TA).
- Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA-IVS).
- Double-inlet left ventricle (DILV).
- Double-inlet right ventricle (DIRV).
- Unbalanced atrioventricular septal defect.
- Heterotaxy syndrome.
- Mitral atresia.
- Solitary undetermined ventricle.

# 3 **What is the epidemiology of <sup>a</sup> univentricular heart?**

- The incidence of the commonly described lesions, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome and tricuspid atresia, is around 2.5 and 1 case per live births, respectively.
- According to the major North American and European databases, the proportion of those with a functional univentricular heart undergoing the final stage palliation (Fontan) procedure is 3.2%.
- The risk of having a univentricular heart is 2-5% in those with an affected sibling or parent.
- Congenital heart lesions are reported in up to 33% of siblings with hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

# 4 **What is the pathophysiology of <sup>a</sup> univentricular heart?**

- In a child with a functionally univentricular heart, the single ventricle supplies both the systemic and pulmonary beds in parallel, as opposed to in series in a normal two-ventricle setting.
- As a result, blood flow to either system depends on the vascular resistance and the presence or absence of any anatomical restrictions to flow (Figure 2).

**Figure 2. Pathophysiology of a univentricular heart: A) low pulmonary vascular resistance results in preferential flow to the pulmonary vascular bed at the expense of systemic perfusion, producing increased oxygen saturation, increased lactate levels and reduced coronary perfusion; B) increasing the pulmonary vascular resistance results in increased flow to the systemic circulation, producing decreased oxygen saturation, decreased lactate levels and improved myocardial perfusion. Qs = systemic flow; Qp = pulmonary flow; MAP = mean arterial pressure; CVP = central venous pressure; SVR = systemic vascular resistance; PVR = pulmonary vascular resistance.**

- Hence, the pathophysiology depends on the underlying anatomical lesions and any surgical intervention, which affects the balance between the pulmonary and the systemic circulation.
- Heart failure occurs in patients with unrestricted pulmonary blood flow, whereas cyanosis occurs in patients with restricted pulmonary blood flow.
- Patients with systemic outflow tract obstruction may present with shock after closure of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), if they are ductus-dependent.

# 5 **What are the radiographical findings in <sup>a</sup> patient with <sup>a</sup> univentricular heart?**

• A chest radiograph (CXR) is a valuable modality in assessing the pulmonary blood flow. Oligaemic lung fields indicate limited pulmonary blood flow, whereas plethoric lung fields, enlarged pulmonary arteries and hazy hila indicate unrestricted pulmonary blood flow (Figure 3).

**Figure 3. Chest radiographical images of patients with a univentricular heart: A) a patient with tricuspid atresia and pulmonary atresia prior to surgery with limited pulmonary blood flow illustrated by oligaemic lung fields; and B) following implantation of a Blalock-Taussig shunt (BTS), illustrated by increased pulmonary blood flow; C) a patient with an unbalanced atrioventricular septal defect prior to surgery with unrestricted pulmonary blood flow demonstrated by plethoric lung fields and engorged hila; and D) following pulmonary artery banding, illustrated by reduced pulmonary blood flow.**

- Computed tomography (CT) scanning is used in the anatomical delineation of vascular structures, including the assessment of the aortic arch and aberrant branching, distal pulmonary arteries and pulmonary venous connections.
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a valuable tool when volume measurements are required to determine the management pathway, such as where the sizes of the mitral valve, aortic valve or left ventricle are needed to establish their adequacy for biventricular repair.
- 3D rapid heart modelling is fast becoming an invaluable tool in assessing complex congenital cardiac lesions and planning their repair. Hollow heart or blood pool models can be created and printed, thereby providing anatomical information on complex wall and defect spatial relations, size and position, as well as functional information on blood flow (Figure 4).

# 6 **What are the findings on investigation in <sup>a</sup> patient with a univentricular heart?**

• Electrocardiography (ECG) varies according to the underlying pathology but is an essential diagnostic modality to identify the conduction abnormalities and can be used as a guide to the underlying diagnosis, such as two distinct P waves are typical in right atrial isomerism, whereas no P waves are seen in left atrial isomerism.

SVC = superior vena cava.**

- Echocardiography is the most important diagnostic tool, as it provides sequential segmental analysis, information on myocardial and valvar function, delineates the presence of any obstructive lesions and guides management.
- Cardiac catheterisation is an essential diagnostic tool, which provides both anatomical and haemodynamic information that are essential for diagnosis and management in many cases. It is routinely performed in patients prior to the second and third stage palliation procedures, to assess the anatomy of the central and peripheral pulmonary arteries, pulmonary artery pressure and vascular resistance (Figure 5).

# 7 **What are the principles of management in <sup>a</sup> patient with a univentricular heart?**

• As the diagnosis of a univentricular heart is usually identified during foetal scanning, paediatric cardiological consultation and pregnancy planning are initially offered to parents.

**Figure 6. Management algorithm for a univentricular heart. BTS = Blalock-Taussig shunt; bPAB = bilateral pulmonary artery band; PDA = patent ductus arteriosus; PGE2 = prostaglandin E2; BCPS = bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt; TCPC = total cavopulmonary connection.**

- Given the complexity of the underlying conditions, the high risk often presented by any medical or surgical intervention, and the lifelong sequelae of a single-ventricle circulation, a complete and exhaustive illustration of all therapeutic options is outlined to the parents at an early as possible stage, ideally when the diagnosis is initially confirmed.
- The timing is crucial to allow the parents the possibility of a termination, according to their wishes. Support and comfort care, including end-oflife care, is part of a modern, multidisciplinary approach.
- If postnatal intervention is contemplated, surgical palliation is the strategy of choice in the majority of centres. Although some centres offer heart transplant as primary therapy, this can be considered at any stage of the surgical palliation process, such as with failure of the single ventricle (Figure 6).

# 8 **What are the principles of surgical palliation in <sup>a</sup> patient with a univentricular heart?**

- Surgical palliation involves staged procedures, with the final aim being construction of a circulation where the systemic venous blood flow reaches the lungs by completely bypassing the cardiac chambers (Fontan circulation).
- This staged palliation typically includes three stages:
  - a) Stage I to achieve a balanced circulation by means of a Norwood procedure, Blalock-Taussig shunt (BTS) or a right ventricle to right atrial conduit or pulmonary artery banding;
  - b) Stage II bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt (BCPS); Glenn procedure;
  - c) Stage III Fontan procedure.
- Some patients with a balanced circulation may not require the first stage as a neonate and can directly undergo the second stage during infancy.

## 9 **What are the principles of Stage <sup>I</sup> palliation in <sup>a</sup> patient with a univentricular heart?**

- Stage I palliation is typically done in the neonatal period.
- The objectives of this stage include:
  - a) unobstructed systemic blood flow from the dominant ventricle;
  - b) unobstructed pulmonary venous return;
  - c) controlled pulmonary blood flow that results in a balanced circulation.

- Surgical procedures for Stage I palliation include:
  - a) systemic to pulmonary shunt such as a BTS (Figure 7);

- b) pulmonary artery banding (Figure 8).
- Additional peri-operative procedures may also be required, including:
  - a) surgical atrial septectomy, aortic coarctation repair, Damus-Kaye-Stansel (DKS) procedure, pulmonary artery plasty and valve repair;
  - b) catheter-based PDA stenting;
  - c) hybrid procedures PDA stenting with bilateral pulmonary artery banding (Figure 9).

- The choice of the appropriate intervention depends on the underlying anatomy and resultant physiology.
- Controlling excessive pulmonary blood flow may not require intervention in patients with native pulmonary stenosis, otherwise pulmonary artery banding is usually performed in patients with an unobstructed pathway.
- Conversely, increasing limited pulmonary blood flow can be achieved by means of PDA stenting, where appropriate, or by a systemic to pulmonary shunt, such as a BTS.
- If the outflow of the systemic ventricle is obstructed, it can be addressed by means of a DKS procedure, with or without aortic arch repair, depending on the presence of an aortic coarctation or arch hypoplasia.
- Pulmonary venous obstruction also needs to be addressed as soon as possible to prevent venous hypertension-mediated lung injury. Equally, an atrial septostomy or septectomy should be considered in patients with an inadequate atrial communication and left atrial hypertension.

# 10 **What are the principles of Stage II palliation in <sup>a</sup> patient with a univentricular heart?**

- Stage II palliation is typically performed between months of age and is also known as a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt, Glenn procedure or superior cavopulmonary connection (Figure 10).
- It is an intermediate step, where the superior vena cava is connected to the ipsilateral pulmonary artery.
- The objective of this stage is to unload the ventricle, whilst delivering an in-series secure source of pulmonary blood flow.
- This stage is routinely preceded by a diagnostic catheterisation, where the pulmonary artery pressure and adequacy of pulmonary arteries size are determined. In selected cases, when pressure data are not required, a CT scan can be used as an alternative to cardiac catheterisation.
- During this stage, associated anatomical problems, such as systemic atrioventricular valve regurgitation and stenosis of the pulmonary arteries are addressed.

## 11 **What are the principles of Stage III palliation in <sup>a</sup> patient with a univentricular heart?**

- Stage III palliation is the final palliative stage and is typically performed between years of age. It is also known as the Fontan procedure or total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC)(Figure 11).
- The aim of this stage is to achieve normalisation of the volume and pressure work of the single functional ventricle, with the systemic venous blood completely bypassing the heart into the lungs and the ventricle pumping fully saturated blood to the systemic circulation.
- Surgical procedures include an extracardiac conduit and lateral tunnel procedure. These procedures may include fenestration between the Fontan pathway and the atrium.

## 12 **What are the most serious long-term complications following Stage III palliation?**

- Protein-losing enteropathy and plastic bronchitis are associated with the poorest prognosis after a Fontan procedure and are associated with a high mortality. They are both attributable to elevated venous pressure and lymphatic congestion.
- Other long-term sequelae include arrhythmias, thromboembolism, hepatic dysfunction, worsening cyanosis and reduced exercise tolerance.

# 13 **What are the long-term outcomes for <sup>a</sup> patient with <sup>a</sup> univentricular heart?**

- Twenty-year freedom from death or transplantation after Stage III palliation (Fontan procedure) is between 60-85%.
- Important prognostic factors include underlying anatomy, elevated atrial pressure and protein-losing enteropathy.

## 14 **What is the role of heart transplantation or ventricular assist devices in the management of a univentricular heart?**

- The numbers of patients offered primary transplantation worldwide are decreasing.
- Heart transplantation is an option in patients with a failing palliative strategy. These patients constitute a high-risk transplantation group with significant mortality even on the waiting list for transplantation.
- The major risk factors related to heart transplantation for failed palliation include:
  - a) pre-transplant comorbidities;
  - b) pre-operative sensitisation;
  - c) complexity of the surgical procedures, such as reconstruction of the central pulmonary arteries or aortic arch;
  - d) prolonged graft ischaemic times;
  - e) higher incidence of graft failure.
- The 5-year survival following transplantation is approximately 70%.
- Mechanical assist devices, including total artificial hearts, are promising technical advances that are underway with limited experience in some centres.

# 15 **Is pregnancy possible in <sup>a</sup> patient with <sup>a</sup> univentricular heart?**

- Successful pregnancy after third stage palliation has been reported in numerous patients with low maternal risk.
- It should be noted that pregnancy in patients with a univentricular heart must be planned early with comprehensive risk stratification and multidisciplinary care.
- High-risk features include prior cardiovascular events, cyanosis, poor functional class, systemic outflow tract obstruction and systemic ventricle ejection fraction <40%.
