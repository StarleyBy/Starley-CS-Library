## Surgery for cardiac arrhythmias

**Constantine Mavroudis, Barbara J. Deal**

- 1 **What is the mechanism of action that causes postoperative atrial tachycardia?**
- The most common mechanism of late postoperative supraventricular tachycardia is macro-re-entrant atrial tachycardia, also known as atrial re-entry tachycardia or atrial flutter.
- By definition, re-entrant tachycardia requires a circuit with unidirectional block and an area of slowed conduction that can be initiated and terminated with pacing. The re-entrant circuit can be large (macro-re-entrant) or quite small (focal).
- In the postoperative patient, the macro-re-entrant circuit is most commonly found in the right atrium, with the area of slow conduction either an atrial scar of the tricuspid isthmus, near the entrance of the inferior vena cava.
- Congenital heart lesions with the highest incidence of atrial re-entry tachycardia include the following:
  - a) Ebstein's anomaly;
  - b) univentricular heart with prior Fontan repair;
  - c) atrial septal defect;
  - d) tetralogy of Fallot;
  - e) transposition of the great arteries with prior atrial switch.
- A typical scenario for the onset of macro-re-entrant atrial tachycardia begins with a premature atrial contraction, which propagates an electrical wave front that encounters unidirectional block near the atrial septum. The wave front is then redirected inferiorly by an alternative route to the right atrial free wall.
- The electrical wave front meets an area of slow conduction, in most cases at the area between the inferior vena cava, tricuspid valve and the coronary sinus, called the inferior or cavo-tricuspid isthmus. This causes an electrophysiological delay and allows the area of unidirectional block to recover conduction.

 The electrical wave front can now enter the area opposite the aforementioned unidirectional block and establish the re-entrant circuit resulting in tachycardia (Figure 1).

 Multiple areas of slow conduction may exist in the atria of patients with congenital heart disease from prior incisions, patches or wall stress.

#### 2 Describe how ablation lesions terminate atrio-reentrant tachycardia

- The arrhythmia circuit can often be interrupted at the inferior isthmus by cryoablation lesions or other forms of energy sources, which produce a transmural scar across the myocardium.
- The cavo-tricuspid isthmus is involved in >60% of atrial re-entry circuits in patients with congenital heart disease.
- The cryoablation lesions transform an area of slow conduction to an area of no conduction (scar tissue), thereby eliminating the circuit.

#### 3 **What is the cause of accessory connection-mediated tachycardia?**

- Accessory connections are bridges of electrical conductivity usually occurring along the atrioventricular annulus.
- The accessory connection may be apparent during sinus rhythm, representing conduction from the atria to the ventricle antegrade over the accessory connection, termed 'manifest conduction' or pre-excitation (Figure 2).

![](_page_2_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Figure 2. Atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia depicting manifest Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. AV = atrioventricular; CS = coronary sinus; SA = sinoatrial.** *Reproduced with permission from Elsevier. Mavroudis C, et al. Late reoperations for Fontan patients: state of the art invited review. Eur J Cardiothorac Surg 2008; 34:.*

- If the accessory connection can only conduct in a retrograde direction, from the ventricle to the atrium, it is termed a 'concealed' accessory connection.
- These accessory connections, manifest or concealed, provide the anatomical substrate for two major types of macro-re-entrant tachycardia, termed 'atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia' (Figure 3).

![](_page_3_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 3. Orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia, the more common form of tachycardia, utilising an accessory connection. Conduction is blocked in the accessory connection, thus losing the delta wave (now 'concealed'). This 'playing field' includes the atria, atrioventricular node, ventricles and accessory connection. Conduction proceeds normally through the atrioventricular node to the ventricle. The delay encountered in the atrioventricular node allows the accessory connection to regain electrical function and the electrical impulse then enters the atria from the opposite direction, from ventricle to atrium, across the accessory connection. AV = atrioventricular; CS = coronary sinus; SA = sinoatrial.** *Reproduced with permission from Elsevier. Mavroudis C, et al. Arrhythmia surgery in patients with and without congenital heart disease. Ann Thorac Surg 2008; 86:.*

- The re-entrant circuit is comprised of the atria, accessory connection, ventricles and the atrioventricular node.
- The most common congenital heart lesions associated with manifest accessory connections include the following:
  - a) Ebstein's anomaly;
  - b) congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries.

- The most common form of supraventricular tachycardia using an accessory connection involves a macro-re-entrant circuit termed 'orthodromic re-entrant tachycardia', which proceeds from the atrium through the normal atrioventricular node to the ventricle and re-enters the atrium via the accessory connection.
- This mechanism accounts for almost 90% of supraventricular tachycardia found in patients with a manifest accessory connection.
- The much less common macro-re-entrant circuit proceeds from the atrium over the accessory connection to the ventricle and re-enters the atrium retrogradely over the normal atrioventricular node. This tachycardia is pre-excited, with a wide QRS owing to conduction over the manifest atrial conduction and is termed 'antidromic reciprocating tachycardia'. It accounts for <5% of supraventricular tachycardias using an accessory connection.
- Because digoxin may accelerate conduction over the accessory connection, its use is not recommended in patients with preexcitation.
- A final form of supraventricular tachycardia is pre-excited atrial tachycardia, which uses an accessory connection that does not involve a macro-re-entrant circuit. In this condition, atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter may conduct antegradely via the accessory connection to the ventricle, often at rates much faster than the atrioventricular node would allow.
- In this setting, the rapid conduction of atrial tachycardia to the ventricle may precipitate ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac arrest.

#### 4 **Describe how ablation lesions terminate atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia**

- Therapeutic options are centred on ablation of the offending connection, which can be present in four locations:
  - a) left-sided connections;
  - b) right free-wall connections;
  - c) anteroseptal connections;
  - d) posteroseptal connections.
- Each location requires a different operative approach and can be accomplished by epicardial or endocardial techniques.
- More commonly, however, these lesions are approached by transcatheter ablation and often can be performed without fluoroscopy.

- The success rate is very high and offers the benefit of recatheterisation and reablation in the event of initial transcatheter failure.
- 5 **What is the mechanism of action that causes atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia?**
- Atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia is a macro-re-entrant tachycardia circuit involving the following:
  - a) fast pathway which is the typical anterior approach to the atrioventricular node in the atrial septum; or
  - b) slow pathway which is the posterior approach to the node in the anatomical area between the coronary sinus and the node (Figure 4).

![](_page_5_Figure_7.jpeg)

**Figure 4. Slow/fast or 'typical' form of atrioventricular (AV) nodal re-entry tachycardia. Conduction to the ventricles is not relevant to the tachycardia circuit. AV = atrioventricular; CS = coronary sinus; SA = sinoatrial.** *Reproduced with permission from Elsevier. Mavroudis C, et al. Arrhythmia surgery in patients with and without congenital heart disease. Ann Thorac Surg 2008; 86:.*

- Atrioventricular conduction encounters unidirectional block in the normal fast pathway fibres superior to the atrioventricular node.
- The electrical wave front is redirected to the slow pathway fibres in the atrial isthmus, which lie between the coronary sinus and tricuspid valve.
- After the impulse exits the isthmus, conduction now re-enters the fast pathway, anteriorly and superiorly, and establishes the re-entrant circuit.
- Atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia is more commonly seen in patients with the following:
  - a) transposition of the great arteries;
  - b) atrioventricular septal defect;
  - c) heterotaxy syndrome.

#### 6 **Describe how ablation lesions terminate atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia**

- Early attempts to control this arrhythmia were based on purposeful atrioventricular nodal ablation that causes heart block and resultant treatment with an atrioventricular pacemaker.
- Holman and associates later showed that distinct cryoablation lesions near the atrioventricular node could interrupt the tachycardia circuit while preserving atrioventricular conduction. Others performed open direct dissection of the perinodal connections away from the compact node with excellent results.
- An anatomical approach to slow pathway modification effectively treats atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia. Lesions can be applied inferior and anterior to the coronary sinus os, with slow pullback from the tricuspid annulus toward the inferior vena cava.
- At the present time, transcatheter cryoablation or radiofrequency techniques can be used. The procedure is performed by placing a linear lesion from the posterior inferior rim of the coronary sinus os to the inferior vena cava. When a right-sided atrioventricular valve is present, a linear lesion is placed from the valve to the posterior os of the coronary sinus.
- Observed results of radiofrequency catheter modification of the atrioventricular node slow pathway in the region of the coronary sinus os have shown that it is not necessary to achieve PR interval prolongation as previously performed.
- Atrioventricular node modification by surgical cryoablation as described herein requires fewer than 3 minutes to perform. Owing to excellent outcomes with transcatheter techniques, surgical ablation

is generally limited to Mustard or Senning procedures undergoing reoperation that avoids the retrograde catheter approach to the pulmonary venous atrium.

#### 7 **What is the mechanism of action that causes focal atrial tachycardia?**

- Focal atrial tachycardia originates in a rapidly firing discrete area of the atrium, conducting in a centrifugal area throughout the atria.
- The electrophysiological mechanism may be automatic, micro-reentrant or triggered with different responses to pacing and medications.
- Either form of focal tachycardia results in tachycardia that occurs independently of normal sinus function, which is inhibited (Figure 5).

![](_page_7_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Figure 5. Right focal atrial tachycardia. AV = atrioventricular; CS = coronary sinus; SA = sinoatrial.** *Reproduced with permission from Elsevier. Mavroudis C, et al. Arrhythmia surgery in patients with and without congenital heart disease. Ann Thorac Surg 2008; 86:.*

- The electrical impulse conduction is then propagated over the body of the atria, which results in stimulation of the atrioventricular node and ventricles.
- Focal atrial tachycardia occurs more commonly in the right atrium, often localised to the crista terminalis or atrial appendages.

#### 8 **Describe how ablation lesions terminate atrial tachycardia**

- Cryoablative therapy in combination with limited atrial resection is used to obliterate or isolate this localised, rapidly firing area ('hot spot').
- Wider areas of focal tachycardia may require atrial wall isolation.
- Multiple ectopic foci that cause arrhythmia recurrence led surgeons to use more extensive techniques, such as pulmonary vein isolation, left atrial isolation, right atrial isolation, and His bundle cryoablation with pacemaker insertion, in problematic circumstances.
- Automatic atrial foci are often localised to the right atrial appendage and may be directly resected either primarily or during the course of concomitant repair.
- In general, these refractory cases are rare and necessitate an individualised therapeutic plan for accurate diagnosis and localised ablation.

#### 9 **What is the mechanism of action that causes atrial fibrillation?**

- Atrial fibrillation is categorised by uncoordinated atrial activation with subsequent worsening of atrial mechanical function.
- On electrocardiography, normal P waves are replaced by rapid oscillations or fibrillatory waves that differ in amplitude, shape and timing. These oscillations are associated with an irregular, frequently rapid ventricular response with variable atrioventricular conduction.
- The electrophysiological mechanisms proposed include multiple independent re-entrant wavelets, rapidly firing foci or rotors with spiral re-entrant wave circuits.
- The triggering single rapid focus may originate in the orifice of the pulmonary veins, while atrial fibrosis associated with haemodynamic changes may contribute to the multiple re-entrant wavelets.
- Clinical conditions that can cause atrial fibrillation relate to markedly dilated left atria that are typically caused by mitral regurgitation (valve abnormalities) and ventricular dysfunction.
- Inflammation and genetic factors may contribute to the development of atrial fibrillation and multiple mechanisms may coexist in a single patient.
- In congenital heart disease, atrial fibrillation is most commonly seen in patients with the following:
  - a) atrial septal defect (repaired or unrepaired);
  - b) single-ventricle physiology;

- c) atrial baffle repair of transposition of the great arteries;
- d) Ebstein's anomaly.
- Even with atrial septal defect closure, atrial fibrillation will recur in a high percentage of patients following surgery if direct arrhythmia intervention is not performed.

#### 10 **Describe how ablation lesions terminate atrial fibrillation**

- The Cox maze III or IV procedures are designed to eliminate atrial fibrillation, while preserving intact atrioventricular nodal conduction and atrial contractility.
- It is designed to interrupt the multiple atrial wavelets and spiral re-entrant circuits by creating a set of transmural lesions across the atrial wall that will result in full-thickness scars.
- As scar tissue is non-conducting, the scar-maze creates a series of 'corridors', along which the coordinated electrical activity is guided from the SA node to the AV node.
- This ablation procedure prevents atrial fibrillation recurrence in over 90% of adult patients in whom concomitant mitral valve repair, atrial septal defect closure or coronary artery bypass surgery was performed.
- The Cox maze III/IV procedure has also successfully been utilised in association with complex congenital heart repairs, such as Fontan conversion, atrial septal defect closure and mitral valve repair, without recurrence of atrial fibrillation and without the use of antiarrhythmic medications.
- Intra-operative use of linear cryoablation or radiofrequency lesions instead of extensive atrial incisions substantially shortens surgical time.
- Duplicating these clinical results using the transvenous catheter approach at electrophysiological study is the subject of intense effort.
- Pulmonary vein stenosis is an uncommon but serious complication of the transvenous catheter technique.
- It should be emphasised that right atrial only arrhythmia surgery is ineffective in averting recurrence of atrial fibrillation.

#### 11 **What is the mechanism of action that causes ventricular tachycardia?**

- Ventricular tachycardia is an abnormal ventricular rhythm characterised by an increased heart rate:
  - a) >120 beats per minute in adolescents or adults;
  - b) >150 beats per minute in children.

- The arrhythmia is usually re-entrant in nature and can originate from various sites in the left and/or right ventricles.
- Ventricular tachycardia may be sustained (lasting >30 seconds) or non-sustained.
- In patients with increasing amounts of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, the arrhythmia may reflect progression of the haemodynamic sequelae of prior repairs or ventricular dysfunction.
- In patients with congenital heart disease, the macro-re-entrant circuit may involve the scar of a ventriculotomy or a ventricular septal patch, such as with tetralogy of Fallot and double-outlet right ventricle.
- In other patients, including those with univentricular physiology, Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve and perhaps with prior Sano procedures, ventricular tachycardia will be recognised or contribute to sudden cardiac arrest, owing to progressive myocardial fibrosis and/or dysfunction.
- In contrast to atrial arrhythmias, improvement of underlying haemodynamic contributing factors may decrease non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Sustained episodes of ventricular tachycardia, however, require additional direct therapy and/or implanted defibrillators.

#### 12 **Describe how ablation lesions terminate ventricular tachycardia**

- Standard cryoablation lesion sets either alone or in combination with epicardial or endocardial resection have not been developed.
- Consequently, ablative therapy must be individualised to each patient depending on the underlying aetiology, which may be ischaemic, fibrotic or oncogenic in origin.
- Currently, ablation of ventricular tachycardia, if amenable to therapy, is approached through transcatheter techniques.
- Intra-operative cryoablative techniques are generally reserved for patients with ventricular tachycardia who are undergoing concomitant surgical therapy.
- Patients with longstanding pulmonary insufficiency following previous tetralogy of Fallot repair can develop right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction that occasionally is accompanied by a re-entrant circuit causing ventricular tachycardia. Under these circumstances, concomitant therapy can be performed with pulmonary valve insertion and cryoablation lesions placed from the superior portion of the ventricular septal defect patch to the superior extension of the right ventriculotomy and from the right medial portion of the

- ventricular septal defect patch to the right portion of the ventriculotomy near the atrioventricular groove. Endocardial resection in the area of the previous ventriculotomy can also be performed as an adjunct.
- Patients with a ventricular septal defect and ventricular tachycardia are encountered rarely. At the time of ventricular septal defect closure, a jet lesion opposite the site of the ventricular septal defect in the inlet of the right ventricle can be found. This plaque, which is often whitish and fibrous in character, can be locally resected and cryoablated, and this may cure the arrhythmia. The ventricular septal defect can be closed after the ablation is performed.
- Rarely, an oncogenic site can be located on the epicardial surface or within the myocardial muscle. Combinations of resection, cryoablation or electrical isolation can be performed if transcatheter approaches are unsuccessful.

#### 13 **Which patients with atrial re-entry tachycardia and two ventricles are candidates for intra-operative cryoablation?**

- Refractory atrial re-entry tachycardia in patients who have not responded to transcatheter ablation and patients with atrial re-entry tachycardia who require repair of associated intracardiac defects, are considered candidates for surgical arrhythmia intervention.
- Surgical success rates for eliminating right atrial macro-re-entrant tachycardia using the modified right atrial maze procedure are >95%.
- In rare cases of tachycardia in a neonate with incessant tachycardia and with structural heart disease, where a transcatheter ablation procedure may pose a significant risk, surgical ablation can be performed with excellent results, albeit requiring an operation.
- In a structurally normal heart, atrial re-entry tachycardia is uncommon and for the most part can be treated with radiofrequency catheter ablation techniques.
- For patients who have atrial tachycardia before surgical intervention, arrhythmia management may be incorporated into a single-stage approach where anatomical and electrophysiological repair can be performed concomitantly without concerns of patient weight or anatomical complexity.

- Atrial tachycardia occurs more commonly as a consequence of the late sequelae associated with intracardiac repair of congenital heart disease, including the following:
  - a) Mustard or Senning procedure: 20-50%;
  - b) Fontan procedure: 40-50%;
  - c) tetralogy of Fallot repair: 34%.
- 14 **Describe the standard therapeutic cryoablation lesions used to treat atrial re-entry tachycardia in patients with two ventricles**
- Surgical intervention for atrial arrhythmias is highly effective and depends on four techniques, including the following:
  - a) cavo-tricuspid atrial ablation for typical atrial flutter (isthmus);
  - b) modified right atrial maze procedure for multiple atrial reentrant circuits;
  - c) Cox maze IV procedure (and its modifications) for atrial fibrillation;
  - d) atrial pacemaker implantation, either to avoid bradycardia or as an anti-tachycardia device.
- Atrial re-entry tachycardia following the Mustard or Senning procedure is amenable to catheter ablation, although a retrograde catheter approach via the aorta and across the tricuspid valve into the pulmonary venous atrium is often necessary, with the attendant risk of creating aortic insufficiency. If the patient requires reoperation for haemodynamic problems, such as atrial baffle leak repair, direct surgical cryoablation between identified anatomical barriers can be performed successfully with minimal prolongation of the surgical repair.
- The right atrial maze procedure consists of the cryoablation lesions of the standard Cox maze IV procedure in the right atrium (Figure 6). Some surgeons elect to perform only the isthmus lesions to prevent the possibility of sinus node dysfunction. This may be especially relevant in infants or very young patients where the width of the cryoablation lesion tends to be large for the existing anatomy, thereby extending the ablation to neighbouring structures where harm to the normal conduction system can occur.

- The modified right atrial maze procedure and the modified Cox maze III procedure are used to treat re-entrant atrial circuits that are likely to be multiple, in patients with variable anatomy, complex congenital heart disease and rare atrial anomalies (Figure 7), including the following:
  - a) juxtaposition of the atrial appendages;
  - b) total anomalous pulmonary venous connection;
  - c) separate atrial entry of the hepatic veins;
  - d) persistent left superior vena cava;
  - e) absence of the coronary sinus.
- The surgical team should be aware of the potential areas of slow conduction, such as the area between the inferior vena cava and the separate entry of the hepatic veins in planning and executing a comprehensive set of cryoablation lesions, without injuring or interfering with the normal atrioventricular conduction mechanism.

#### 15 **What are the standard cryoablation lesions used to treat atrial re-entry tachycardia in patients undergoing a Fontan conversion?**

- Patients with univentricular physiology and prior surgical repairs typically have hypertrophied, scarred, enlarged right atria with multiple atrial macro-re-entrant circuits.
- Transcatheter ablation therapy in patients who have had a Fontan operation is associated with a high rate of early recurrence of atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, and it does not address the frequently associated coexisting haemodynamic abnormalities. Many centres have achieved favourable results with a combined approach of repair of associated lesions concomitantly with Fontan conversion and arrhythmia surgery.
- These patients often have unusual anatomical configurations that challenge the application of cryoablation lesions to treat atrial re-entry tachycardia.
- The most common anatomical variances of a single ventricle that require alteration of the right-sided maze procedure include the following:
  - a) tricuspid atresia;
  - b) mitral atresia;
  - c) common atrioventricular valve in the context of atrioventricular septal defects.
- Cryoablation lesions that are applied to areas of slow conduction with special reference to the underlying anatomy, such as no lesion can be placed from the tricuspid annulus to the inferior vena cava in tricuspid atresia for obvious reasons (Figure 8).
- In other cases, the pre-existing atriopulmonary Fontan procedure was performed by atrial compartmentalisation and included a patch to cover the tricuspid valve and the coronary sinus. The placement of cryoablation lesions to treat atrial re-entry tachycardia in these patients is hampered by this patch that camouflages the coronary sinus, an important landmark for delivering cryoablation lesions. In view of this, the patch is removed, anatomy identified and the cryoablation lesions can be placed. The tricuspid valve can then be covered again by another patch (Figure 9).

Cryoablation lesions applied during a Fontan conversion: A) atrial view following an atriopulmonary Fontan operation, where both the inferior and superior venae cavae have been transected, atrial wall has been excised and the atrial septal patch has been removed. No measures are taken to preserve the sinoatrial node, which is non-functional in a significant number of patients. Cryoablation lesions are placed in three areas to complete the modified right-sided maze procedure. The isthmus ablation changes in relation to the anatomical substrate. In this patient with tricuspid atresia, the cryoablation lesion connects the posteroinferior portion of the coronary sinus os with the transected inferior vena cava os; B) modified right-sided maze procedure in a patient with a double-outlet right ventricle and mitral atresia. The isthmus block is accomplished with lesions between the posteroinferior portion of the coronary sinus os with the transected inferior vena cava os, and between the tricuspid valve annulus with the transected inferior vena cava os. These isthmus block lesions are usually placed across the ridge of the resected atrial compartmentalisation patch; C) modified right-sided maze procedure in a patient with a single ventricle and unbalanced atrioventricular canal. The isthmus block is accomplished by creating lesions between the posteroinferior portion of the coronary sinus os and the transected inferior vena cava os and between the common atrioventricular valve annulus and the transected inferior vena cava os. These isthmus block lesions are usually placed across the ridge of the resected atrial compartmentalisation patch; D)third variant of the Cox maze procedure, where the right pulmonary veins have been 'isolated' by an incision and left pulmonary veins by cryoablation. There are lesions from the base of the excised left atrium to the pulmonary vein lesion and from the mitral annulus to the pulmonary venous lesion.

#### 16 **What are the standard cryoablation lesions used to treat atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing Fontan conversion?**

- Fontan patients who have developed atrial fibrillation often have an antecedent history of atrial re-entry tachycardia. Right atrial re-entry tachycardia may degenerate into atrial fibrillation or coexist with episodes of atrial fibrillation, owing to the anatomical right atrial abnormalities in the Fontan patient.
- The treatment for atrial fibrillation therefore is based on the progression of the arrhythmias that will require a biatrial maze. The standard cryoablation lesions to treat atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing Fontan conversion include all the right-sided cryoablation lesions and the left-sided lesions that have been modified for patients with a single ventricle, as noted in Figures 7 and 8.

#### 17 **Describe the standard therapeutic cryoablation lesions used to treat atrial fibrillation in patients with two ventricles**

- In general, the combination of the right atrial and left atrial maze operation is performed together.
- Although there have been doubts about some of the lesions for the left-sided maze, such as the lesion from the confluence of the pulmonary veins to the base of the left atrial appendage, prospective studies are lacking.
- In addition to isolation of the pulmonary veins, it appears that the lesion from the confluence of the pulmonary veins to the P3 scallop of the posterior mitral annulus is very important to prevent a re-entrant circuit that will cause recurrence of atrial fibrillation.
- Likewise, the lesion on the epicardial surface of the heart at the coronary sinus, that complements the aforementioned lesion to the mitral annulus, adds to the success rate of the ablation procedure.

#### 18 **Can right-sided lesions be performed on <sup>a</sup> beating heart without cardioplegic arrest?**

- This is possible as long as there is no existing atrial or ventricular communications. If not detected or ignored, those can be the cause for shunting of air to the left side of the heart resulting in air embolism, causing stroke and organ dysfunction.
- Careful pre-operative and intra-operative echocardiography can often ascertain the presence of a shunt that if detected should compel the operating team to use cardioplegic arrest for the rightsided maze procedure.

• Others do not rely on any of the diagnostic tools and use cardioplegic arrest under all circumstances of performing the rightsided maze to avoid air embolism and to apply the lesion set in a nonworking, motionless heart.

### 19 **Is <sup>a</sup> biatrial maze always required for atrial fibrillation?**

- The cause of atrial fibrillation in adult patients with acquired cardiac disease has generally been ascribed to a re-entrant circuit that originates in the confluence of the pulmonary veins.
- As a result, many programs have advocated the idea that isolation of the confluence of the pulmonary veins with some energy source is enough to treat atrial fibrillation in this population.
- This approach is not totally accepted and several authors have reported better results with the Cox maze III/IV procedure for atrial fibrillation.
- In adult congenital heart disease patients, atrial fibrillation occurs most often with right atrial dilatation, right atrial fibrosis and preexisting atrial tachycardia before the onset of atrial fibrillation.
- Anatomical substrates include the following:
  - a) old atriopulmonary Fontan connections;
  - b) untreated atrial septal defect, with or without partial anomalous pulmonary venous connections;
  - c) longstanding, untreated Ebstein's anomaly.
- While there are no prospective studies, it makes sense to perform a biatrial maze in adult congenital heart disease patients with significant atrial arrhythmias for a more comprehensive chance of arrhythmia ablation in the long term.

#### 20 **Describe the principles of prophylactic arrhythmia surgery**

- Prophylactic arrhythmia surgery has been suggested to be performed concomitantly with some congenital heart repairs even when clinical arrhythmias are not present.
- The rationale for this procedure is based on the high incidence of subsequent arrhythmia occurrence in a selected subsets of patients with congenital heart disease and the need for surgical interventions, including the following:
  - a) Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve;
  - b) Fontan operation;

- c) reoperation for tetralogy of Fallot;
- d) atrial septal defect closure over 40 years of age.
- As there is no agreement in what constitutes a standard prophylactic arrhythmia procedure, the surgery should include the following protocols:
  - a) limited to patients at highest risk;
  - b) tailored to the anatomical variants with specific lesions;
  - c) associated with a very low risk of procedure-induced arrhythmias;
  - d) associated with a low incidence of harm to conducting tissue.

#### 21 **Describe the lesion sets used for prophylactic arrhythmia surgery**

- Patients with congenital heart disease have multiple anatomical anomalies that may confound any lesion set. For example, the conduction system may not be in the expected location and therefore subject to unwanted injury.
- These complex potential anatomical variations must be considered under the conditions that prophylactic arrhythmia ablation is performed without advanced knowledge that arrhythmias will actually develop in the short- or long-term postoperative course.
- A standard lesion set was recently considered and adopted by a consensus group after careful deliberation. The lesion set is clearly away from the atrioventricular node and is therefore considered to be safe from nodal injury in patients with the following:
  - a) secundum atrial septal defect;
  - b) Ebstein's anomaly;
  - c) single-ventricle physiology;
  - d) tetralogy of Fallot following surgery.
- The same set, however, is not safe for patients with partial atrioventricular septal defect or other anomalies that have displaced atrioventricular nodes.
- In cases where the chance of potential arrhythmia is high, a more aggressive lesion set may be applied (Figure 10).
- The concept of prophylactic arrhythmia surgery can be extended further and may be applicable to any patient with atrial scarring who is undergoing reoperation for haemodynamic reasons. In addition to the lesion set noted in Figure 14, another lesion is placed from the fossa ovalis across the crista terminalis to the atrial incision posteriorly (Figure 11).

To complete this lesion set, an additional lesion is placed to extend the medial atriotomy with cryoablation to the anterior os of the inferior vena cava.

- Some surgeons advocate an additional prophylactic lesion from the base of the right atrial appendage to the anterior tricuspid annulus (Figure 12).
- Patients over 40 years of age undergoing atrial septal defect closure have a high incidence of developing atrial re-entry tachycardia and atrial fibrillation at some stage in the postoperative period.
- A more aggressive right-sided lesion set in addition to the left-sided lesion set has been proposed, with an additional cryoablation lesion that connects the superior vena cava with the inferior vena cava,

across the interatrial lesion that connects the fossa ovalis and the posterior flap of the incised atrium across the crista terminalis. These two lesions have been proposed to ablate this area of slow conduction and prophylactically protect against the potential for atrial re-entry tachycardia in older patients with an atrial septal defect (Figure 13).

• To conclude the prophylactic lesion sets, circumferential isolation of the pulmonary vein confluence, connection of the pulmonary vein confluence with the P3 location of the posterior mitral valve annulus,

and connection of the pulmonary vein confluence with the base of the left atrial appendage, which requires resection to prevent atrial thrombus formation, is performed (Figure 14).

- Although these lesion sets have been proposed, they have not been universally accepted at the present time.
- It has been proposed that these lesion sets should be standardised for therapeutic measures, as well as for prophylactic applications for patients with congenital heart disease undergoing repair or re-repair and should be tested in a prospective multi-institutional study.

• The principles of prophylactic procedures should be preserved, that is to say that the prophylactic procedure should be simple to perform, associated with minimal complications and be intended to solve the potential problems that can cause important haemodynamic aberrations to the patient in the long term.
