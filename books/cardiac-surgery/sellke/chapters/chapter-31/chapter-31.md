# Approaches and Techniques for Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation

Hadi Toeg, David Glineur, and Sophie De Roock

- ◆ Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) pertains to prolonged extracorporeal cardiopulmonary bypass using intrathoracic or extrathoracic vascular cannulation. The bypass circuit includes a distensible venous blood reservoir receiving deoxygenated blood from the patient passing through a nonocclusive centrifugal pump toward the membrane oxygenator and countercurrent heat exchanger to be delivered finally to the patient via an arterial or venous cannula [\(Fig. 31.1\)](#page-2-0). To prevent thrombosis within the ECMO circuit from blood tubing contact interactions, patients are generally anticoagulated with heparin or bivalrudin.[1](#page-16-0)
- ◆ Providing full or partial circulatory support with adequate gas exchange is the primary objective of ECMO. Broad indications for initiating ECMO include isolated cardiac failure, respiratory failure, and cardiorespiratory failure. The arrangement of the cannulae and ECMO circuit can be varied, depending on the indication for extracorporeal life support. Generally, patients with isolated respiratory failure can be supported with venovenous ECMO, whereas patients with cardiac or cardiorespiratory failure will require venoarterial ECMO.
- ◆ ECMO was first used in the early 1970s and, although several studies have demonstrated poor clinical outcomes, successes were individually dramatic. In an effort to evaluate, improve, and innovate ECMO therapy, the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) was established in 1989. This international multicenter registry reports clinical outcomes in adult and children who are undergoing various forms of ECMO therapy[.2](#page-16-1)

# **Step 1. Surgical Anatomy**

# **1. Femoral Vessels**

- ◆ The key for successful ECMO cannula placement is understanding the anatomy of the common femoral artery, with emphasis on its branches and its relationship to the inguinal ligament and common femoral vein ([Fig. 31.2](#page-5-0)). When performing a surgical cutdown for ECMO placement, it is critical to identify and dissect out the superficial femoral and profunda femoris arteries to ensure cannulation of the common femoral artery proper and to consider placement of an antegrade perfusion catheter in the superficial femoral artery.
- ◆ To provide safe control of the proximal aspect of the common femoral artery, part of the inguinal ligament may need to be divided.

# **2. Axillary Artery**

◆ Cardiac surgeons should also be familiar with the pertinent anatomy of the axillary and subclavian arteries. In particular, the axillary vein is anterosuperior to the artery, and the brachial plexus is posterolateral ([Fig. 31.3\)](#page-5-1).

#### **Step 2. Preoperative Considerations**

- ◆ It is imperative to determine whether a patient requiring ECMO has a potentially reversible underlying pathologic process or has plans for longer term therapy (e.g., left ventricular assist device, heart or lung transplantation). General indications include acute reversible respiratory or cardiac failure unresponsive to optimal medical therapy for which recovery can be expected within a sensible time frame. Contraindications include patients with active bleeding, conditions incompatible with a normal quality of life after cardiac or lung recovery (e.g., major brain injury) and mechanical ventilation for more than 10 days.
- ◆ After deciding which type of ECMO circuit would provide maximal oxygenation and/or circulatory support, the surgeon will need to devise a cannulation strategy. This can be divided into central (thoracic) or peripheral (extrathoracic) cannulation. Venovenous ECMO in the setting of respiratory failure will typically be performed via peripheral cannulation—the femoral and/ or jugular vein). Although most venoarterial ECMO procedures are performed via peripheral cannulation, a central cannulation strategy (i.e., right atrium and ascending aorta) may be considered in the setting of post–cardiopulmonary bypass patients or for those who require effective left ventricular venting. Finally, appropriately sized arterial and venous cannulae must be chosen to provide adequate flow.
- ◆ Percutaneous peripheral ECMO cannulation can now be performed in both the venovenous and venoarterial ECMO settings. A single double-lumen cannula for venovenous ECMO can be placed under guidance by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and/or fluoroscopy.
- ◆ After establishing full cardiorespiratory support, the team must routinely assess for distal limb perfusion in the setting of peripheral arterial cannulation, the need for left ventricular venting and, finally, preventing upper body hypoxia. The latter situation can occur when a venoarterial ECMO patient ejects deoxygenated blood from the left ventricle and the oxygenated femoral arterial cannula flow is prevented from reaching the upper body. In this setting, an additional peripheral venous cannula can be placed to provide oxygenated blood from the ECMO circuit.[3](#page-16-2)

# **Step 3. Operative Steps**

# **1. Venoarterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation: Peripheral Cannulation**

# Femoral Artery Cannulation

- ◆ For femoral artery cannulation, a vertical incision overlying and just slightly medial to the femoral pulse can be made [\(Fig. 31.4](#page-8-0)). Alternatively, a slightly oblique incision aligned with the inguinal ligament to facilitate healing can be made.
- ◆ Proximal and distal control of the femoral artery should be obtained. A noncalcified site for the arteriotomy should be chosen after considering where the proximal clamp may be safely placed and how the repair will be accomplished when the cannula is removed. The distal vessels may be occluded with separate clamps or tapes. Purse-string sutures (5-0 polypropylene) can be placed in a diamond shape overlying the area of insertion.
- ◆ A transverse arteriotomy should be made and the femoral cannula gently introduced while an assistant releases the proximal clamp. The cannula is then secured by tying it to the proximal snare, with a second suture securing the tubing to the surface of the thigh.
- ◆ Percutaneous femoral arterial cannulation can be achieved via an ultrasound-guided Seldinger technique in the common femoral artery. A 15 F or 17 F arterial cannula should be used to allow some distal limb perfusion. Alternatively, one can perform a hybrid cannulation (e.g., percutaneous after a femoral cutdown; see [Fig. 31.4](#page-8-0)).
- ◆ To ensure adequate distal limb perfusion, an antegrade catheter can be placed in the superficial femoral artery open or percutaneously, or a small retrograde catheter can be placed in the posterior tibial artery via cutdown ([Fig. 31.5\)](#page-8-1)[.4](#page-16-3)

### Axillary Artery Cannulation

- ◆ A 6-cm transverse incision is made 2 cm below the clavicle overlying the deltopectoral groove (see [Fig. 31.3](#page-5-1)). The dissection is continued between the fibers of the pectoralis major. The exposure is aided by two self-retaining retractors.
- ◆ The cephalic vein can be identified in this space, where it penetrates the fascia to join the axillary vein. The clavipectoral fascia is incised, and the pectoralis minor muscle is retracted laterally or partially dissected. The axillary vein should be encircled with loops and gently retracted cephalad.
- ◆ The artery, which lies superior and deep to the vein, can be identified by palpation and then exposed and controlled proximally and distally with vessel loops. Care must be taken to avoid injuring the medial and lateral brachial plexus cords.
- ◆ After heparin is administered, the artery can be controlled with clamps and an 8-mm tube graft should be anastomosed to this site (see [Fig. 31.4](#page-8-0)), and the arterial cannula should be inserted into the tube graft. The cannula is not advanced into the axillary artery proper, but rather perfuses from within the graft.
- ◆ After eventual decannulation, the stump can be controlled with several large hemoclips applied transversely and then oversewn with 4-0 polypropylene sutures.

# Femoral Venous Cannulation

- ◆ We prefer to use a multistage venous cannula because it may be used for definitive venous drainage. One or two purse-string sutures (4-0 polypropylene) are placed around the common femoral vein, and a 14-G needle is inserted followed by guidewire advancement to the superior vena cava (SVC; see [Fig. 31.4\)](#page-8-0). The cannula is inserted over the wire, with further minor opening of the vein wall with a scalpel superiorly up to 3 mm from the apex of the diamond or via progressive dilation. Further advancement of the cannula is guided by TEE to ensure that the tip is just inside the SVC. The cannula is anchored to the leg with several heavy silk sutures.
- ◆ Once the patient is weaned from ECMO, the purse strings can be gently snared as the cannula is removed and then tied, with little compromise of the femoral vein lumen. Although jugular venous cannulation can be used in adult peripheral venoarterial ECMO, it is generally used in the pediatric population.

#### **2. Venoarterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation: Central Cannulation**

### Ascending Aortic Arterial Cannulation

- ◆ The most important factor for central arterial cannulation is securing the cannula and ensuring hemostasis. After an appropriate cannulation site in the distal ascending aorta has been chosen, two 4-0 large pledgeted polypropylene sutures are used to create two diamond-shaped pursestring sutures ([Fig. 31.6](#page-11-0)). Two snare snuggers are placed around these sutures. A subcostal tunnel is made to allow the arterial tubing to reach the arterial cannula once it has been placed. The ascending aorta is cannulated with a one-piece arterial cannula, an elongated one-piece arterial cannula, and the snare snuggers are tightened (see [Fig. 31.6](#page-11-0)). The arterial cannula is attached to the tunneled arterial tubing. If hemostasis is achieved, the purse-string sutures are tied in place onto the snare snugger with an extra piece of rubber tubing or a plastic button. Heavy silk ties are used to secure the cannula to the snare snuggers. Additional purse-string sutures can be placed if adventitial bleeding is noted. See Chapter 2 for details regarding general techniques for central cannulation.
- ◆ Depending on the clinical scenario, the patient's sternum can be closed with the arterial cannula arising subcostally. Chest tubes should be placed to monitor bleeding from the pericardial well.

# Venous Cannulation

- ◆ See Chapter 2 for details and information regarding central venous cannulation. This can be performed with a two-stage venous cannula through the right atrial appendage. Achieving hemostasis can be difficult due to friable atrial tissue. This can be reinforced with large pledgeted sutures.
- ◆ An alternative approach for venous cannulation is placing a multistage venous cannula through the femoral vein. This can be achieved by a percutaneous method (see next section).
- ◆ Left ventricular and left atrial venting can be achieved by placing a 20 F multistage cannula through the left atrial wall, just adjacent to the right superior pulmonary vein. Alternatively, a larger single-stage venous cannula could be placed and connected to the venous return tubing. Once again, placing several large, pledgeted, purse-string sutures and securing with snare snuggers is needed to attain acceptable hemostasis. See Chapter 2 for principles for placing a left ventricular vent.

# **3. Venovenous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation: Peripheral Percutaneous Cannulation**

- ◆ Prior to performing venovenous ECMO, appropriately sized vessels and ECMO configuration (e.g., femoral-femoral, femoral-jugular) must be chosen to achieve maximum flow to support the patient.
- ◆ The femoral vein is punctured with an 18-G needle by palpating the femoral artery and directing the needle just medial to the artery or via ultrasound. A J-tipped guidewire is advanced through the needle and should be visualized in the right atrium–inferior vena cava (IVC) junction. A series of graduated dilators are used, and the venous cannula is placed over the guidewire (see [Fig. 31.4](#page-8-0)). A similar approach is carried out for the jugular vein. Recirculation can occur if the drainage catheter is in close proximity with the outflow cannula, leading to decreased efficiency in the ECMO circuit. This can occur in the femoral-femoral and femoraljugular configuration.
- ◆ To minimize recirculation and ease of implantation, a novel method of achieving venovenous ECMO is via a double-lumen catheter, which can be placed in the right internal jugular vein. Ultrasound-guided venous puncture of the right internal jugular vein is achieved with an 18-G needle; a stiff J-tipped guidewire is placed and should be anchored deep into the IVC. TEE is essential; however, to minimize complications, fluoroscopy should be considered.[5](#page-16-4) A series of graduated dilators are used, and the double-lumen catheter is placed such that the upper and lower drainage holes are located at the SVC and IVC, respectively [\(Fig. 31.7A](#page-14-0)). The return (oxygenated blood) port is found in the mid–right atrium and the oxygenated blood is directed toward the tricuspid valve (see [Fig. 31.7B\)](#page-14-0). Adjustments can be made based on oxygenated flow using TEE Doppler.

# **Step 4. Postoperative Care**

- ◆ Daily assessment for organ recovery and consideration for ECMO weaning should be done because major complications, including bleeding, thromboembolism, limb ischemia, and infection, are common[.6](#page-16-5) If a patient is initially placed on venoarterial ECMO for cardiorespiratory support, and cardiac function improves, the surgeon should consider switching to venovenous ECMO because this approach has a lower risk of bleeding, seizures, and infections. Alternatively, if a patient is placed on venovenous ECMO for respiratory support and has further deterioration of cardiac function, using an arterial cannula should be considered.[7](#page-16-6)
- ◆ Systemic anticoagulation during ECMO is recommended to prevent thromboembolic events. However, in the case of a patient with ongoing bleeding or coagulopathy, lowering the anticoagulation targets, using heparin-bonded circuits, or even holding anticoagulation for a short period of time can be considered[.8,9](#page-16-7)

# **Step 5. Pearls and Pitfalls**

- ◆ Sites of arterial and venous cannulation should be chosen with consideration to the vessel to cannula size match and how the site of vascular entrance can be repaired should complications such as bleeding or dissection occur.
- ◆ Communication between the surgeon and perfusionist is paramount, especially in regard to sizing and understanding which acceptable flows can be achieved through various cannulae. Due to the extensive potential cannulation and ECMO circuit strategies, the surgical team should be well prepared. The appropriate equipment should be available in the room, including TEE and/or fluoroscopy.
- ◆ Careful femoral arterial cannulation should be performed to avoid life-threatening complications such as iliac artery puncture or rupture. Patients with coronary artery disease are at particular risk due to ubiquitous atherosclerosis[.7](#page-16-6)
- ◆ Recirculation can occur during venovenous ECMO if the inflow drainage catheter is in close proximity with the outflow/oxygenated cannula, thereby resulting in lack of oxygenation to the right ventricle and systemic circulation. This also decreases efficiency in the ECMO circuit. This can be avoided by using a single double-stage cannula in the jugular vein (see [Fig. 31.7](#page-14-0)) or ensuring that the drainage femoral cannula is placed in the IVC, below the diaphragm and above the renal veins, while the outflow femoral cannula enters the right atrium[.10,11](#page-16-8)
