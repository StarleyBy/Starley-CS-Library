# **Step 1. Surgical Anatomy**

- ◆ Knowledge of the anatomy involved with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is paramount in understanding the pathophysiology that ultimately contributes to dynamic subaortic obstruction.
- ◆ HCM is defined as left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy in the absence of another underlying cause, such as aortic valve stenosis, systemic hypertension, or metabolic disorders, such as Fabry disease or amyloidosis.[1](#page-23-0)
- ◆ Septal hypertrophy and systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the anterior mitral leaflet combine to produce LV outflow obstruction, as well as mitral valve regurgitation in varying degrees. Previously, LV outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction was thought to be present in a minority of patients, but it is common in symptomatic patients with HCM.
- ◆ Patients display varying degrees and distribution of LV hypertrophy, ranging from the anterior basal septum (most common) to the apex [\(Fig. 29.1](#page-2-0)). Midventricular obstruction may occur if the hypertrophied septum comes into contact with the papillary muscles.
- ◆ Dynamic SAM of the mitral leaflets contributes to obstruction by narrowing the LVOT. The mechanism is thought to be due to the Venturi effect in the LVOT[.2](#page-23-1) In addition, one study has documented increased lengths of the mitral leaflets in HCM; a ratio of anterior mitral leaflet length to LVOT diameter more than 2.0 was found to be associated with obstruction.[3](#page-23-2) An added consequence of SAM is varying degrees of mitral regurgitation, which contributes to the patient's symptoms of dyspnea and fatigability.
- ◆ Abnormalities of mitral valve chordae and papillary muscles are present in 15% to 20% of patients, but these do not always contribute to outflow tract obstruction or mitral valve dysfunction (e.g., false chords). Direct insertion of the papillary muscle to the body of the anterior mitral valve leaflet may contribute to outflow tract obstruction[.4](#page-23-3)
- ◆ In obstructive HCM, the aortic valve is usually normal, in contrast to congenital subaortic stenosis, in which turbulence due to a subaortic membrane and muscular obstruction often leads to cusp retraction and aortic valve regurgitation.

### **Abstract**

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a debilitating disease that can produce significant symptoms that affect the quality of life, and most symptomatic patients have left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Understanding the anatomy and physiology of the disease is critically important in planning surgical relief of subaortic and/or midventricular obstruction to minimize procedural risk and obtain the best late outcomes. This chapter summarizes our experience and approach to surgical repair, as well as postoperative management.

#### **Step 2. Preoperative Considerations**

#### **1. Diagnosis and Imaging**

- ◆ As seen by echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the most common pattern of hypertrophy is diffuse involvement of the ventricular septum. LV wall thickness typically ranges from 20 to 22 mm; however, 5% to 10% of patients have a wall thickness ranging from 30 to 50 mm[,5](#page-23-4) and some patients have SAM with a septal thickness of less than 29 mm.
- ◆ LVOT obstruction is characterized on Doppler echocardiography by a high-velocity, late-peaking signal, sometimes described as dagger-shaped. Patients with no resting obstruction may reveal latent obstruction with provocative maneuvers, as described in the following.
- ◆ The surgeon should identify the level of LVOT obstruction relative to SAM because this will ultimately guide the surgical approach. At times, the white endocardial fibrous scar on the septum demarcating the area of contact between the septum and the anterior mitral leaflet can be identified on an echocardiogram.
- ◆ Transthoracic echocardiography is also used to identify any primary mitral valve pathologies that need to be addressed intraoperatively, including abnormal papillary muscles and their insertion.

#### **2. Indications for Septal Myectomy**

- ◆ Septal myectomy is recommended for patients who have symptoms and diminished functional capacity refractory to initial medical therapy (e.g., beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and/or disopyramide).[6,7](#page-23-5)
- ◆ Patients with a resting LVOT gradient of 30 mm Hg or more have reduced late survival rates compared to those with HCM without obstruction[.6](#page-23-5)
- ◆ For those patients with latent obstruction, septal myectomy is indicated because relief of latent obstruction results in similar symptom relief, as does myectomy in patients with resting obstructive HCM[.8](#page-23-6)
- ◆ Midventricular obstruction can cause symptoms similar to those occurring with subaortic obstruction[.9](#page-23-7) With isolated midventricular obstruction, there is no SAM of the mitral leaflet; rather, the site of obstruction is the contact point between the anterolateral papillary muscle and the midventricular septum.
- ◆ Patients with apical HCM and diastolic heart failure may benefit from apical myectomy to enlarge the LV cavity.[10,11](#page-23-8)

## **3. Preoperative Planning**

- ◆ Documentation of the severity of the LVOT gradient is made by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography. Many symptomatic patients will have minimal resting outflow tract gradients, and it is important in the preoperative evaluation to perform provocative maneuvers to elicit a gradient. These maneuvers include simple Valsalva maneuver, inhalation of amyl nitrite, exercise echocardiography, and infusion of isoproterenol during a hemodynamic study[.12](#page-23-9)
- ◆ Cardiac MRI may be useful in identifying details of the ventricular anatomy, but it is not necessary for planning the operation in patients with isolated subaortic obstruction. This study is commonly performed, however, to determine LV wall thickness more precisely and the presence or absence of delayed enhancement, which may influence decision making for implantation of a defibrillator to prevent sudden cardiac death.[13,14](#page-23-10)
- ◆ The level of ventricular outflow obstruction should be determined based on the transthoracic echocardiogram, which will reveal SAM of the mitral valve and the bright endocardial scar of the septal contact area.
- ◆ It is important to identify midventricular or multilevel obstruction in patients with LVOT obstruction because a simple subaortic septal myectomy may not be adequate to relieve obstruction and the resulting symptoms[.15](#page-23-11)
- ◆ If chest pain is a presenting symptom, coronary angiography or computed tomography (CT) angiography of the coronaries is warranted to assess for the need for concomitant coronary artery bypass surgery if the patient has fixed coronary obstruction or unroofing of intramyocardial vessels, where bridging is thought to produce obstruction[.16](#page-23-12)

#### **Step 3. Operative Steps**

- ◆ Depending on the location of the obstruction, a transaortic or transapical approach can be used. Both approaches will be covered in this chapter.
- ◆ Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is essential in confirming the preoperative findings and to assess the mitral valve for associated pathology.

#### **1. Transaortic Approach**

◆ A median sternotomy is performed with the institution of normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass in the usual fashion, with a single two-staged venous cannula through the right atrium. Before placing the patient on bypass, intracardiac pressures should be measured to ascertain the LV to aortic gradient to help confirm a successful myectomy at the end of the case[.17](#page-23-13) This is done by using a 2.5-inch, 22-G spinal needle that is placed into the aorta near the inflow cannula, as well as a 3.5-inch, 22-G spinal needle in the left ventricle through the right ventricular free wall and septum. By measuring pressures from both needles at the same time, the gradient can be calculated. To assess dynamic LVOT gradients, a premature ventricular contraction (PVC) can be induced by tapping the heart, and the gradient in the next beat is recorded ([Fig. 29.2\)](#page-6-0).

Direct intraoperative measurement of the left ventricle outflow tract (LVOT) pressure gradient. As shown on the *top,* a 2.5-inch, 22-G spinal needle is inserted into the aorta near the inflow cannula; a 3.5-inch, 22-G spinal needle is inserted into the left ventricle through the right ventricular free wall and septum. The pressure gradient can be calculated in real time by measuring pressures from both needles simultaneously. On the *bottom,* dynamic LVOT gradients can be elicited by tapping the heart to induce a premature ventricular contraction (PVC) and recording the gradient in the next beat. **Figure 29.2**

- ◆ Cardiac arrest is achieved with antegrade cold blood cardioplegia after the ascending aorta is cross-clamped. An initial dose of 1000 mL is used due to associated LV hypertrophy.
- ◆ A transverse-oblique (hockey stick) aortotomy is made, beginning cephalad to the commissure between the right and noncoronary sinuses, continuing rightward and inferiorly toward the base of the noncoronary sinus. At the base of the incision, 1 cm should be left between the incision and the aortic annulus. Of note, this incision is lower than that of a typical aortic valve replacement and is closer to the sinotubular junction ([Fig. 29.3\)](#page-9-0).
- ◆ Several maneuvers are used to facilitate exposure of the subaortic area. One can use pericardial stitches only on the right side to elevate the right heart and allow the ventricular apex to fall posteriorly. The inferior edge of the aortotomy can be retracted anteriorly with stay sutures. The assistant then places the cardiotomy sucker through the aortic valve, against the commissure between the noncoronary and left aortic sinuses into the left ventricle, thereby displacing the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve posteriorly as well as removing blood from the operative field ([Fig. 29.4](#page-9-1)). A sponge stick can be used to depress the right ventricle to orient the LVOT tract more anteriorly. Elevating and tilting the operating table to the left will also help to align the surgeon's view with the plane of the subaortic septum.

The aortotomy. A transverse-oblique (hockey stick) incision is made, beginning cephalad to the right aortic sinus, continuing rightward and inferiorly toward the base of the noncoronary sinus *(dashed line).* Of note, 1 cm should be left between the incision and the aortic annulus. **Figure 29.3**

Exposure. The aortotomy can be retracted with stay sutures to facilitate exposure. The cardiotomy sucker can be placed into the left ventricle through the aortic valve, against the commissure between the noncoronary and left aortic valve cusps. This displaces the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve posteriorly and removes blood from the operative field. **Figure 29.4**

◆ After identifying the area of septal and mitral contact (usually demarcated by white fibrous tissue), a no. 10 blade on a long handle is used to make an incision in the septum, beginning just to the right of the nadir of the right aortic sinus. This incision is carried upward initially and then leftward toward the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. To assess for the correct incisional depth, the width of the no. 10 blade is a good reference. Scissors can be used to complete the excision ([Fig. 29.5](#page-12-0)).

Myectomy. With a no. 10 blade on a long handle, an incision is made in the septum, beginning just to the right of the nadir of the right aortic sinus. This incision is carried upward initially and then leftward toward the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve *(dashed line).* **Figure 29.5**

- ◆ This initial excision is deepened and carried further toward the apex of the left ventricle. Hypertrophied septum beyond the endocardial scar is excised, as well as any trabeculations. Pituitary rongeurs can be used to facilitate excision. At the end of the excision, 3 to 12 g of muscle is considered an adequate amount of tissue [\(Figs. 29.6](#page-15-0) and [29.7\)](#page-15-1).
- ◆ In regard to the mitral valve, papillary muscles that insert directly into the body of the anterior leaflet can contribute to LVOT obstruction. By excising these anomalous papillary muscles, LVOT obstruction may be alleviated further.
- ◆ The left ventricle is irrigated for any residual debris. It is important to inspect the aortic and mitral valves to rule out any inadvertent injury.
- ◆ The aortotomy is clo1sed in two layers with 4-0 polypropylene sutures. The patient is weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass in the usual fashion. Atrial and ventricular pacing wires are placed before closing the chest.

#### **2. Transapical Approach**

- ◆ This approach is beneficial when the obstruction is at or below the level of the papillary muscles. The incision is also used for surgery to enlarge the left ventricle in patients with the nonobstructive apical variant; in this condition, the small size of the LV cavity contributes to diastolic dysfunction. The transapical incision is used for patients with isolated midventricular obstruction that would be difficult to reach through a transaortic approach[.8,10](#page-23-6)
- ◆ As in the transaortic approach, a median sternotomy is used and the patient is put on cardiopulmonary bypass in the usual fashion.
- ◆ To elevate the ventricular apex, moist laparotomy pads are placed behind the left ventricle.

Extension of myectomy. The initial excision is carried further toward the apex of the left ventricle. Hypertrophied septum beyond the endocardial scar is excised (along the *dashed line*), as well as any trabeculations. Note the use of a sponge stick to depress the right ventricle to orient the left ventricular outflow tract more anteriorly. **Figure 29.6**

**Figure 29.7** Completed excision. Pituitary rongeurs can be used to facilitate excision toward the apex.

- ◆ For midventricular obstruction:
  - ◆ A small apical ventriculotomy (≈ 5 cm) is made parallel and lateral to the left anterior descending coronary artery. This incision should be located over the apical dimple ([Fig. 29.8\)](#page-18-0).
  - ◆ Papillary muscles and chordae are retracted away from the septum with the cardiotomy sucker, and the white endocardial scar is identified.
  - ◆ Myectomy of the myocardial scar and the muscle below is performed. Significantly enlarged papillary muscles, as well as excess muscle on the free wall, can be shaved ([Fig. 29.9\)](#page-18-1).

Apical ventriculotomy. An incision of approximately 5 cm is made parallel and lateral to the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, over the apical dimple. **Figure 29.8**

Apical septal myectomy. The papillary muscles and chordae are retracted leftward, and the septal muscle is excised, beginning at the apex and progressing to the subaortic area to enlarge the left ventricular cavity (along the *dashed line*). The apical incision is also used to approach midventricular obstruction. **Figure 29.9**

- ◆ For apical HCM:
  - ◆ Due to the obliteration of the apex with hypertrophied muscle, papillary muscles are displaced apically. Particular attention is made to the protection of the papillary muscles on entering the ventricle.
  - ◆ Septal myectomy is performed first to increase the LV cavity size, followed by LV free wall myectomy.
  - ◆ Inspection and digital palpation confirm the extent of the myectomy.
- ◆ The ventriculotomy is closed in two layers with Teflon strips of felt [\(Fig. 29.10](#page-21-0)).

## **Step 4. Postoperative Management**

- ◆ Maintaining adequate afterload is of utmost importance in the postoperative setting. Vasodilating drugs are avoided, and vasopressors (e.g., vasopressin, norepinephrine) are commonly used to maintain peripheral vascular resistance.
- ◆ Atrioventricular synchrony is particularly important to maintain adequate filling of a hypertrophied ventricle. Atrial fibrillation (AF) may be poorly tolerated; amiodarone is used to treat AF. It is used prophylactically in patients with a history of atrial arrhythmias and in patients with prodromic arrhythmias, such as premature atrial contractions.
- ◆ If hypotension due to supraventricular tachycardia develops, early direct current (DC) cardioversion is warranted.
- ◆ Beta blockade is reinstituted after the immediate intensive care period. Typically, half the preoperative dose is used.
- ◆ All patients undergo transthoracic Doppler echocardiography before discharge to evaluate for residual LVOT obstruction, cardiac valve function, and any pericardial effusion.

#### **Step 5. Pearls and Pitfalls**

- ◆ The most common reason for residual LVOT gradients after myectomy is inadequate length (toward the apex) of septal excision. The other important cause of residual gradients and symptoms is residual midventricular obstruction due to contact of the anterolateral papillary muscle and septum. In patients undergoing myectomy for LVOT obstruction who have long segment septal hypertrophy, we often combine transapical midventricular myectomy with the subaortic myectomy.
- ◆ The LV to aortic gradient should be remeasured after discontinuing cardiopulmonary bypass, both by direct intracardiac measures and TEE. If the provoked LVOT gradient is greater than 15 to 20 mm Hg, bypass should be reinitiated for additional resection, depending on the level of obstruction.
- ◆ Significant residual SAM or mitral regurgitation is usually a consequence of inadequate muscle resection, rather than the lack of a mitral valve procedure. Of note, hypovolemia or anemia can be causes of residual SAM, even after adequate myectomy.
- ◆ If there are no primary abnormalities of the mitral valve, an additional mitral valve procedure is typically not needed to alleviate the patient's mitral regurgitation.

- ◆ If an anomalous papillary muscle inserts into the free edge of the anterior leaflet, caution should be exercised if one proceeds with excision because the muscle could be contributing to the leaflet's support. Excision may lead to prolapse and actually worsen regurgitation. In contrast, anomalous papillary muscles that insert into the body of the anterior leaflet should be excised to enlarge the LVOT area.
- ◆ If the patient has complete right bundle branch block preoperatively, transaortic septal myectomy often leads to left bundle branch block and the need for a permanent pacemaker. At particular risk are patients who have previously had alcohol septal ablation, which commonly causes right bundle branch block.
