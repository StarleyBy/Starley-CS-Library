# **Step 1. Surgical Anatomy**

- ◆ Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) are characterized by dilation of the aorta (to at least 1.5 times its normal diameter) at the diaphragmatic hiatus—the boundary that separates the descending thoracic and abdominal aortic segments—with varying degrees of extension into the chest and abdomen.
- ◆ The normal diameter of the aorta varies by anatomic location and by the patient's sex, age, and body size. Average normal aortic diameters for men and women, respectively, are 28 and 26 mm at the level of the mid-descending thoracic aorta, 23 and 20 mm at the celiac axis, and 19.5 and 16.5 mm at the infrarenal aorta. Body surface area is a better predictor of aortic size than is height or weight, particularly in patients younger than 50 years.
- ◆ The Crawford classification of TAAA repairs ([Fig. 26.1](#page-1-0)) enables appropriate risk stratification and selection of specific treatment modalities based on the extent of the aortic replacement. Extent I aneurysms involve the descending thoracic aorta and upper abdominal aorta to the level of the renal arteries. Extent II aneurysms involve the descending thoracic aorta and infrarenal abdominal aorta to the level of the aortic bifurcation and can involve the iliac arteries as well. Extent III aneurysms involve the distal half of the descending thoracic aorta and varying portions of the abdominal aorta. Extent IV aneurysms start from the portion of the thoracoabdominal aorta where the visceral arteries (celiac and superior mesenteric arteries) arise and extend into most or all of the remaining abdominal aorta.1
- ◆ Understanding the anatomy of the spinal cord circulation is necessary to prevent spinal cord ischemia. The arteria radicularis magna (artery of Adamkiewicz) is the largest of the radicular medullary arteries supplying the anterior spinal artery and, therefore, is often targeted for reimplantation during TAAA repair. This artery has a variable origin; it arises from a lower intercostal artery (T9–T12) in 60% of persons, from a lumbar artery (L1–L4) in approximately 25%, and from an upper intercostal artery (T5–T8) in about 15%. As a principle, we target large intercostal arteries with slow back-bleeding at the level of T7 to T10.2

#### **Step 2. Preoperative Considerations**

- ◆ Nonoperative management, which consists of strict blood pressure control, cessation of smoking, and at least yearly surveillance with imaging studies, is appropriate for asymptomatic patients who have small aneurysms.
- ◆ Indications for operation in asymptomatic patients include an aortic diameter exceeding 5 to 6 cm or a rate of dilation greater than 1 cm/year. In patients with Marfan syndrome or a related connective tissue disorder, the threshold for operation is lower for absolute size and rate of growth. In the case of TAAAs that cause symptoms, especially pain, or that are complicated by superimposed acute dissection, the risk of impending rupture warrants expeditious evaluation and urgent aneurysm repair, even when the above-mentioned threshold diameters have not been reached.
- ◆ With the exception of patients who require emergency surgery, all patients undergo a thorough preoperative evaluation, with an emphasis on cardiac, pulmonary, and renal function. Patients who have asymptomatic aneurysms and severe coronary artery occlusive disease undergo myocardial revascularization before aneurysm repair. If clamping proximal to the left subclavian artery is anticipated in patients in whom the left internal thoracic artery has been used as coronary artery bypass graft, a left common carotid to subclavian artery bypass is performed to prevent cardiac ischemia when the aortic clamp is applied.
- ◆ Preoperative renal insufficiency has been a major risk factor for early mortality throughout the history of TAAA repair. The main strategy used to reduce the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy from preoperative imaging studies is providing intravenous hydration. Periprocedural administration of acetylcysteine can be used as well. Ideally, surgery is delayed for 24 hours or longer after contrast administration. If renal insufficiency occurs or becomes worse after a patient receives contrast, the surgical procedure is postponed until renal function recovers or is satisfactorily stabilized.
- ◆ Pulmonary complications are the most common form of postoperative morbidity in patients undergoing TAAA repairs. Patients with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) greater than 1.0 L and a PCO2 less than 45 mm Hg are considered satisfactory surgical candidates. In suitable patients, borderline pulmonary function frequently is improved by smoking cessation, treatment of bronchitis, weight loss, and a general exercise program that the patient follows for a period of 1 to 3 months before operation.
- ◆ An evolving aspect of selecting the appropriate treatment in patients with TAAAs is the choice between performing a traditional open graft replacement and using an endovascular approach. Purely endovascular TAAA repairs require the use of fenestrated or branched stent grafts. These stent grafts are currently custom-made based on the patient's preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan and, therefore, are not immediately available. It can take 4 to 6 weeks for customization. Currently, no stent grafts have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for TAAA repairs in the United States. Hybrid repairs entail the use of open visceral bypass grafting to secure organ perfusion before the entire aneurysm is covered with a stent graft. Complete endovascular TAAA repair and hybrid repair are used for patients who have limited physiologic reserve and are poor candidates for open repair. Both techniques are becoming increasingly popular.3

## **Step 3. Operative Steps**

#### **1. Intraoperative Management Strategy**

- ◆ A cell-saving device is used throughout the procedure to salvage shed blood from the operative field. The patient's temperature is allowed to drift down to a nasopharyngeal temperature of 32° to 33°C (89.6°–91.4°F). To prevent acidosis, sodium bicarbonate solution is administered by continuous infusion at a rate of 2 to 3 mEq/kg/hr while the aorta is clamped.
- ◆ Left heart bypass (LHB) and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) drainage are used to optimize organ protection in patients undergoing Crawford extent I or II TAAA repair and in patients who are undergoing extent III or IV TAAA repair after a previous descending thoracic aortic replacement.4-6 Additionally, in patients with poor cardiac function, LHB is used to reduce cardiac strain and thus to improve the patient's ability to tolerate aortic clamping. During aortic clamping, the patient's blood pressure is controlled primarily by the anesthesia team with the help of LHB. The target mean pressure is approximately 80 mm Hg. If additional help is required to control hypertension, nicardipine or nitroglycerin is administered. Enough CSF is drained to keep the CSF pressure between 8 and 10 mm Hg during the operation.6
- ◆ Motor-evoked potential monitoring can provide useful information about spinal cord function and thereby anterior spinal perfusion during aortic repair. This method of spinal cord monitoring, which precludes complete neuromuscular blockade, requires the use of special anesthetic techniques.7,8

#### **2. Incisions and Aortic Exposure**

- ◆ The patient is turned to a right lateral decubitus position with the shoulders placed at 60 to 80 degrees and the hips flexed to 30 to 40 degrees from horizontal and stabilized with a beanbag [\(Fig. 26.2](#page-4-0)). For extent I, II [\(Fig. 26.3](#page-4-1)), and III TAAAs, the upper portion of the thoracoabdominal incision is generally made through the sixth intercostal space (see [Fig.](#page-4-0)  [26.2A\)](#page-4-0); the upper (more often) or lower ribs may be divided posteriorly to achieve additional proximal or distal exposure, respectively, as needed. For extent III aneurysms, sometimes we use the seventh intercostal space. The incision is gently curved as it crosses the costal margin to reduce the risk of tissue necrosis at the apex of the lower portion of the musculoskeletal tissue flap. In contrast, to approach extent IV aneurysms, a straight oblique incision is made through the eighth (most common), ninth, or even tenth interspace; the exact incision site is chosen based on the patient's body habitus and specific anatomy (see [Fig. 26.2B](#page-4-0)). In most cases, the distal extent of the incision is at the level of the umbilicus. The incision is extended toward the pubis if there are iliac aneurysms to be repaired.1
- ◆ Fixed metal retractors attached to the operating table provide consistent static exposure. The diaphragm is divided in a semicurvilinear fashion to protect the phrenic nerve and preserve a 3- to 4-cm posterolateral rim of diaphragmatic tissue to facilitate closure when the operation is complete. The abdominal aortic segment is exposed via a transperitoneal approach; the retroperitoneum is entered lateral to the left colon, where the spleen, left kidney, and ureter are retracted anteriorly and to the right. The crus of the diaphragm is divided, and the left renal artery is identified but not circumferentially dissected or encircled with a tape. An open abdominal approach permits direct inspection of the bowel, abdominal viscera, and visceral blood supply after aortic reconstruction is completed.

**Figure 26.3**

◆ When the aneurysm encroaches on the left subclavian artery, the distal aortic arch is mobilized gently by dividing the remnant of the ductus arteriosus. The vagus and recurrent laryngeal nerves are identified. Occasionally, the vagus nerve is divided below the recurrent nerve to provide additional mobility, thereby protecting the recurrent nerve from injury. If clamping proximal to the left subclavian artery is anticipated, this artery is separately and circumferentially mobilized to enable placement of a bulldog clamp. After achieving adequate exposure of the aorta, heparin (1 mg/kg) is administered before aortic clamping or the start of LHB.

## **3. Graft Replacement of the Aorta**

- ◆ Patients with extensive TAAAs (extents I, II, and often III) are at greatest risk of developing postoperative paraplegia or paraparesis, and LHB is used to provide distal aortic perfusion during the proximal portion of the aortic repair.4 This is achieved by using temporary bypass from the left atrium, via a cannula inserted through the inferior pulmonary vein, to the distal descending thoracic aorta with a closed circuit in-line centrifugal pump [\(Fig. 26.4\)](#page-6-0). Carefully examining CT scans or magnetic resonance images helps the surgeon select an appropriate site for direct aortic cannulation. Areas with intraluminal thrombus are avoided because cannulating them can lead to distal embolization ([Fig. 26.5](#page-6-1)).
- ◆ A clamp is applied to the distal transverse arch, between the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries, or to the proximal descending thoracic aorta, just distal to the left subclavian artery. When LHB is used, a distal aortic clamp is placed between T4 and T7 (see [Fig. 26.4](#page-6-0)). Bypass flows are adjusted to maintain normal proximal arterial and venous filling pressures. Flows between 1500 and 2500 mL/min are generally required. The aorta is opened, transected 2 to 3 cm beyond the proximal clamp, and dissected from the esophagus. Patent upper intercostal arteries are oversewn to avoid stealing blood supply from the spinal cord.
- ◆ The proximal anastomosis is performed between the aorta and a 22-, 24-, or 26-mm Dacron graft with continuous 3-0 polypropylene sutures. In patients with fragile aortic tissues (e.g., those with a connective tissue disorder or complicated acute aortic dissection), 4-0 polypropylene sutures are often used. Interrupted polypropylene mattress sutures with felt pledgets are used to reinforce selected portions of the anastomoses. Surgical adhesives are avoided in these operations.

**Figure 26.5**

- ◆ After the proximal anastomosis has been completed, LHB is stopped, the aortic cannula from the descending thoracic aorta is removed, and the entire remaining aneurysm is opened longitudinally. The origins of the visceral and renal branches are identified, and cold (4°C [39.2°F]) lactated Ringer's solution or Custodiol solution is intermittently delivered to the renal arteries via balloon catheters [\(Fig. 26.6\)](#page-8-0).9,10 In patients receiving LHB, 9 F balloon-tipped Pruitt cannulas can be placed in the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries so that selective visceral perfusion can be delivered from the pump circuit. If the reconstruction is expected to be complicated and take more time than usual, we choose to perform selective visceral perfusion.
- ◆ For most extent I and II repairs, patent lower intercostal arteries are selected and reattached to an opening cut in the side of the graft (see [Fig. 26.6](#page-8-0)); large arteries with little or no back-bleeding are considered particularly important. When none of these arteries is patent, endarterectomy of that aortic wall and removal of calcified intimal disease should be considered as a means of identifying arteries suitable for reattachment, after which the proximal clamp is often moved down the graft to restore intercostal perfusion ([Fig. 26.7\)](#page-8-1).

**Figure 26.7**

- ◆ In extent I repairs, the reattachment of the visceral arteries is often incorporated into a beveled distal anastomosis. In extent II and III repairs, the visceral artery origins, usually those of the celiac, superior mesenteric, and right renal arteries, are reattached to one or more oval openings in the graft (see [Fig. 26.7](#page-8-1)). Twenty-five percent of the patients have a stenosis at a visceral artery origin and require endarterectomy, stenting, or interposition bypass grafting.11 In the majority of cases, the left renal artery requires direct attachment to a separate opening in the graft (see [Fig. 26.7,](#page-8-1) inset) or is attached via interposition bypass grafting. Usually, for patients with a connective tissue disorder, a four-branched graft ([Fig. 26.8\)](#page-10-0) is used to attach the celiac, superior mesenteric, and right and left renal arteries separately.12 A four-branched graft is also used if the origins of the visceral arteries are far apart from each other.13
- ◆ In extent IV repairs, the proximal anastomosis can be a beveled anastomosis that incorporates the visceral vessels, or it can be a straight anastomosis between the lower descending thoracic aorta and Dacron graft, in which case the visceral vessels are attached as described above.
- ◆ When the aneurysm extends below the renal arteries, a distal anastomosis is performed near the aortic bifurcation ([Fig. 26.9](#page-10-1)). In patients with iliac artery aneurysms, a bifurcation graft is sewn onto the end of the straight graft, and routine distal bypass anastomoses are performed. Care is taken to preserve circulation to at least one of the internal iliac arteries.

## **4. Closure**

◆ After the cross-clamp has been removed and the patient is hemodynamically stable, protamine sulfate is administered. Then, meticulous hemostasis is achieved; the renal, visceral, and peripheral circulations are assessed; and the body is rewarmed with warm water irrigation of the operative field. Sometimes, if there is enough tissue, the aneurysm wall is then loosely wrapped around the aortic graft. Two posteriorly located chest tubes and a 19 F closed-suction retroperitoneal drain are placed before closure. The diaphragm is closed with continuous no. 1 polypropylene sutures, and the thoracotomy is closed with braided polyester sutures and reinforced with figure-of-eight steel wires.

# **5. Alternative Techniques: The Reversed Elephant Trunk Technique**

◆ The reversed elephant trunk technique is performed as an initial operation in patients who have extensive aneurysmal disease involving the ascending aorta, transverse aortic arch, and thoracoabdominal aorta and present with a symptomatic TAAA (back pain), ruptured TAAA (contained rupture, as shown by CT scan), or a TAAA that is considerably larger in size than the ascending aorta ([Fig. 26.10\)](#page-12-0).14 The TAAA is replaced during the first stage of aortic repair ([Fig. 26.11\)](#page-12-1). A portion of the proximal end of the aortic graft is invaginated into the graft lumen, and the folded graft edge is used for the proximal anastomosis; this is called the reversed elephant trunk technique. During the second-stage operation, the suspended section of the graft is retrieved [\(Fig. 26.12A\)](#page-12-2) and used to replace the ascending and transverse aortic arch (see [Fig. 26.12B\)](#page-12-2).

#### **6. Alternative Techniques: Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest**

◆ Hypothermic circulatory arrest is selectively used in cases in which the distal aortic arch cannot be safely clamped because it is too large ([Fig. 26.13](#page-14-0)) or because the aneurysm has ruptured. Arterial and venous cannulas are placed via the descending thoracic aorta and the left common femoral vein. A second venous cannula is placed in the left atrium via the inferior pulmonary vein to enhance venous drainage and prevent cardiac distension. After the patient has been cooled to 18° to 20°C (64.4°–68°F) and circulatory arrest has been initiated, the aneurysm is opened, and the proximal anastomosis to the distal aortic arch is performed.15-17 Then, a Y-limb from the arterial line is connected to a side branch of the graft, the graft is de-aired and clamped, and pump flow to the upper body is resumed via the Y-limb. The remainder of the aortic repair is then completed.

#### **Step 4. Postoperative Care**

#### **1. Early Postoperative Management**

- ◆ Complications that are commonly associated with an increased risk of death include paraplegia, renal failure, respiratory failure, cardiac events, and bleeding.18
- ◆ During the first 24 to 48 hours after the procedure, meticulous blood pressure control is necessary to avoid spinal cord injury. The target mean arterial blood pressure of 80 to 100 mm Hg is maintained by using dopamine and/or norepinephrine (Levophed) for hypotension. For hypertensive patients, nicardipine can be used. In patients with particularly fragile aortic tissue (i.e., those with a connective tissue disorder), a target blood pressure range of 70 to 80 mm Hg is used to help maintain hemostasis. Hypertensive episodes are controlled to prevent suture line disruption, which can cause severe bleeding or pseudoaneurysm formation. Hypotensive episodes must also be avoided because they can precipitate ischemic complications, including paraplegia and renal failure.
- ◆ Drainage of CSF is usually continued for 2 days postoperatively. Fluid is drained with a closed collection system, as needed, to keep the CSF pressure between 10 and 12 mm Hg during the early postoperative period and between 12 and 15 mm Hg after patients have confirmed that they are able to move their legs.6,19

<span id="page-14-0"></span>![](_page_14_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 26.13**

- ◆ For patients in whom paraplegia or paraparesis develops, the first line of treatment is to increase the blood pressure immediately to at least 100 mm Hg of mean arterial blood pressure. Other treatments include draining CSF, administering steroids and osmotic diuretics, optimizing hemodynamics, correcting anemia, and preventing fever.
- ◆ Vocal cord paralysis can contribute to respiratory complications and should be suspected in patients with postoperative hoarseness and confirmed by direct examination. Effective treatment can be provided by direct cord medialization or, in higher-risk patients, by polytetrafluoroethylene injection.
- ◆ Infection of a TAAA graft is often fatal; thus, intravenous antibiotics are continued until all drains, chest tubes, and central venous lines have been removed.

#### **2. Long-Term Surveillance**

◆ Patients who have undergone TAAA repair remain at risk for developing new aneurysms in other aortic segments or in reattachment patches. Lifelong surveillance with annual CT scanning or magnetic resonance imaging of the chest and abdomen is especially important in patients with a connective tissue disorder.18,20 Subsequent aortic repairs can be performed with surprisingly low mortality and morbidity, particularly when done electively.21

## **Step 5. Pearls and Pitfalls**

- ◆ Beware of the potential presence of a retroaortic left renal vein, which can be injured during TAAA exposure. When this vein is encountered, it is occasionally possible to mobilize the intact vessel and work underneath it. More commonly, however, the vein is temporarily ligated and divided, and after the aortic replacement is completed, the vein is repaired with direct end-to-end anastomosis or a short interposition graft.
- ◆ During extent I and II repairs, the aorta at the site of the proximal anastomosis is transected and carefully dissected off of the esophagus. This enables the placement of full-thickness aortic sutures while preventing esophageal injury. When the thoracic duct is encountered in this region, it should be ligated to prevent postoperative chylothorax.
- ◆ After the aorta is unclamped, intravenous indigo carmine is administered to confirm renal perfusion. Extravasation of dye into the retroperitoneal field indicates injury of the left ureter, which can then be repaired.
- ◆ It is not uncommon to encounter a tear in the splenic capsule during dissection, particularly during thoracoabdominal reoperations, when one may find that dense adhesions have fused the spleen and diaphragm. A very low threshold for performing splenectomy is necessary to prevent dangerous postoperative splenic bleeding and ischemic sequelae.
