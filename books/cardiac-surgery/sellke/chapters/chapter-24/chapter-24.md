# Type A Aortic Dissections

Hlal Moncef and François Dagenais

#### **Step 1. Surgical Anatomy**

- ◆ Type A dissection is defined by the presence of a septum creating two lumens within the ascending aorta. The DeBakey classification further divides the Stanford type A classification according to whether the septum is located solely in the ascending aorta (DeBakey type II) or extends distally within the arch and thoracoabdominal aorta (DeBakey type I; [Fig. 24.1](#page-2-0)).
- ◆ The septum is secondary to an intimal tear, with separation of the media creating a true lumen—original aortic lumen lined by intima—and a false lumen, resulting from blood flow separating the media.
- ◆ In type A dissection, the primary intimal tear is located predominantly at the right anterolateral border of the ascending aorta, just above the sinotubular junction. In less than one-third of cases, the primary intimal tear may be located in the arch or thoracoabdominal aorta.1 In such cases, the septum in the ascending aorta is secondary to a retrograde extension of the dissection process.
- ◆ The dissection process may progress to the following:
  - ◆ aortic rupture, usually within the pericardium
  - ◆ extension to branch vessels such as the coronary ostia, arch vessels, and visceral arteries
  - ◆ reentrance into the true lumen, with creation of reentry tears. Tears owing to the shearing of branch vessels of the aorta (natural fenestrations) also contribute to equilibrate the pressure between the true and false lumens.
- ◆ The dissection process often extends to the aortic root, with loss of commissural support of the aortic valve (mainly the left noncoronary commissure), and may lead to aortic valve malcoaptation and aortic insufficiency ([Fig. 24.2\)](#page-2-1).

- ◆ Organ malperfusion secondary to branch vessel occlusion may supervene after type A dissection. The cause of the malperfusion may be dynamic or static [\(Fig. 24.3](#page-4-0)).
- ◆ Dynamic branch vessel malperfusion is caused by high pressure within the false lumen, with collapse of the true lumen (see [Fig. 24.3A\)](#page-4-0). True lumen branch vessels are hypoperfused because of proximal true lumen aortic collapse or ostial occlusion by the displaced septum. This represents the most frequent mechanism of malperfusion with type A dissection; it is usually relieved by successful reperfusion of the true lumen with operative repair.
- ◆ Static malperfusion is caused by occlusion of a branch vessel secondary to extension of the dissection process within the branch vessel (see [Fig. 24.3B\)](#page-4-0). A branch vessel hematoma and reentry flap with in the branch vessel resulting in occlusion are examples. Malperfusion often persists following aortic repair.
- ◆ Combined malperfusion results from a combination of dynamic and static causes.

#### **Step 2. Preoperative Considerations**

- ◆ A diagnosis of acute type A dissection mandates an emergent operative procedure because historic reports have established that up to 1% to 2% of patients die each hour following the insult.2 Early medical therapy may lessen the risk of early rupture but still mandates emergent operative repair.3 Operative indications should be individualized in older patients with significant comorbidities or in patients with a severe neurologic deficit and a delayed presentation (> 6 hours) because operative mortality and morbidity rates are very high.
- ◆ Once the diagnosis is suspected, aggressive medical treatment should be instituted and diagnostic confirmation obtained, followed by operative repair:
  - ◆ Pulse and dP/dt control using either beta blocker–/nitroprusside or a labetalol (Ttrandate) strategy
  - ◆ Invasive monitoring
  - ◆ Pain control
- ◆ Patients with severe malperfusion, such as visceral ischemia with an elevated lactate level, may initially be managed with an endovascular approach. This can be followed by an open aortic repair once the malperfusion is relieved and the patient is more stable.4
- ◆ Although patients may be directed to the operating room solely on the visualization of a septum within the ascending aorta on transthoracic echocardiography, most patients are diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) angiography. This may provide additional information, such as extent of the dissection and involvement of branch vessels, site of the primary intimal tear, and the presence of pericardial effusion, malperfusion, and aneurysmal dilation.
- ◆ Coronary angiography is time-consuming and is usually not performed. However, patients with obvious signs of coronary malperfusion and hemodynamic compromise may initially be considered for coronary artery stenting, followed by definitive repair. Patients with a previous coronary artery bypass graft or who have known severe coronary artery disease may be considered for preoperative coronary angiography or cardiac coronary CT on a selected basis.

# **Step 3. Operative Steps**

#### **1. Anesthesia Preparation**

- ◆ In addition to the standard monitoring during cardiac surgery, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) may be of additional value to monitor brain saturation and differences between hemispheres during the circulatory arrest period.5
- ◆ Temperature monitoring should include determining the nasopharyngeal, pulmonary artery, and bladder temperatures.
- ◆ Pharmacologic additives may be used. In preparation for circulatory arrest, mannitol, 0.5 g/ kg, is administered to promote diuresis. The use of barbiturates such as pentobarbital or the use of corticosteroids remains controversial.6,7
- ◆ Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is mandatory. The baseline evaluation includes assessment of myocardial function and the evaluation of pericardial effusion, aortic valve competency, site of the primary intimal tear, aortic diameters, and concomitant valvular problems. In addition, TEE is essential to monitor cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)–induced malperfusion. Preferential perfusion of the true lumen should be assessed regularly, especially at critical time points such as CPB initiation, after aortic cross-clamping of the ascending aorta (if performed), and during resumption of CPB after the circulatory arrest period.

#### **2. Cardiopulmonary Circuit Preparation**

◆ The arterial line should be divided into two arms using a "Y" connector to reperfuse the distal aorta once the distal anastomosis is performed or to select an alternate cannulation site in case of malperfusion on CPB initiation.

#### **3. Cardiopulmonary Initiation**

◆ The femoral artery has been historically used as inflow during type A dissection. The right axillary artery has emerged as the preferred arterial cannulation site. The femoral artery, however, is rapidly accessible for hemodynamically unstable patients. The right axillary cannulation requires more time but ensures antegrade aortic perfusion, facilitates initiation of antegrade cerebral perfusion, and is associated with less malperfusion than the femoral artery.8

# Right Axillary Artery Cannulation Technique

- ◆ The right axillary artery dissection and cannulation are performed before sternal opening. Dissection of the axillary artery, a rare occurrence, is a contraindication to using the artery as arterial inflow. Dissection of the innominate artery, with or without extension in the proximal subclavian artery, is not a contraindication per se but is associated with a higher risk of malperfusion on CPB initiation.9
- ◆ An infraclavicular incision is performed at the distal third of the clavicula. The fibers of the pectoralis major are divided, exposing the clavipectoral fascia, which is incised. The axillary artery lies posterior and cephalic to the axillary vein. Often, an arterial branch of the axillary artery lies in proximity to the border of the pectoralis minor and may be used to gain access to the axillary artery. The artery is looped with a Silastic tape. Systemic administration of 5-1000 U of heparin is given before vessel clamping. Cannulation may be carried out by inserting a cannula directly into the axillary artery or by sewing an 8-mm Dacron graft in an end-to- side fashion to the axillary artery. A 20 F cannula is then inserted into the graft and connected to one branch of the arterial line [\(Fig. 24.4](#page-7-0)). Vascular complications are reported to be less with the 8-mm graft technique, especially in the presence of small axillary arteries.10
- ◆ Alternate arterial cannulation sites are the innominate artery and direct cannulation of the ascending aorta. An 8-mm graft may be sutured end to side to the innominate artery, free of significant hematoma or dissection. Direct ascending aortic cannulation is performed using a Seldinger technique, with a needle puncture at the inner portion of the anterior surface of the distal ascending aorta ([Fig. 24.5](#page-7-1)). Direct cannulation of the ascending aorta ensures perfusion of the true lumen and has been proposed as the preferential arterial cannulation method by some authors.11,12
- ◆ A double-stage venous cannula is inserted into the right atrium. A retrograde cardioplegia catheter is positioned in the coronary sinus, and a purse string is fashioned on the left superior pulmonary vein for left ventricular venting once the aorta has been clamped or the ventricle is fibrillating.
- ◆ CPB is then initiated, with care taken to ensure good true lumen perfusion and stability in other monitoring parameters, such as electrocardiography and NIRS.

#### **4. Temperature Management, Circulatory Arrest, and Aortic Cross-Clamping**

- ◆ Historically, circulatory arrest with deep hypothermia (18°–20°C) has been used to perform the open distal aortic repair and anastomosis during type I aortic dissection. During the last decade, moderate hypothermia (24°–28°C) with antegrade cerebral perfusion has been advocated to reduce CPB time, coagulopathy, and organ dysfunction.
- ◆ The authors' temperature management strategy depends on identification of the primary intimal tear site and arch diameter. CT and TEE may guide the surgeon to identify the site of the primary intimal tear. In the presence of a primary intimal tear at the sinotubular junction with the absence of a dilated arch (< 5 cm), moderate hypothermia (24°–28°C, nasopharyngeal) with antegrade cerebral perfusion is adopted. When the arch is dilated or the location of the primary intimal tear is uncertain or highly suspected to be in the arch, the risk of a complex arch procedure is high. This may necessitate a period of circulatory arrest longer than 30 minutes. In such a case, to optimize distal organ protection, the authors will adopt a deep hypothermia (18°–20°C) strategy.

◆ The debate is still unresolved as to whether the aorta should be clamped before inducing circulatory arrest. Aortic cross-clamping is mandatory in case of severe aortic regurgitation and left ventricle (LV) distention, despite LV venting on ventricular fibrillation. In patients without LV distention, the aorta may be left unclamped until the desired hypothermia level is reached for the circulatory arrest period. Unless a significant atheroma burden is suspected, the authors prefer to cross-clamp the aorta. Advantages include confirming the location of the primary intimal tear before inducing the circulatory arrest period and assessment of the aortic root pathology. The aorta should be clamped at the midascending level in case a higher cross-clamp is required because of an aortic rupture. Further confirmation of good true lumen perfusion by TEE should be assessed after cross-clamping.

# **5. Distal Aortic Repair**

- ◆ At the level of hypothermia targeted, the arterial perfusion through the axillary artery is decreased to 10 mL/kg/min, and the innominate artery is clamped, thus initiating selective cerebral antegrade perfusion (SACP) through the right carotid artery. A standard hemiarch anastomosis is usually performed in less than 30 minutes. In such a setting, SACP is only performed through the right axillary artery without clamping the other, often fragile arch vessels, unless the cerebral saturation on the left side falls significantly compared to the right side. When the circulatory arrest time is expected to extend over 30 minutes, such as in cases of complete arch replacement, a soft-tipped catheter may be inserted into the right carotid ostium to provide bilateral, antegrade, cerebral protection. In this case, the authors prefer to perform an arch-first technique using a trifurcated graft, thus resuming complete cerebral perfusion once the arch vessel anastomoses have been completed.13
- ◆ Once SACP is initiated, the aortic cross-clamp is released, and the aortic arch is inspected for tears. In the absence of a tear, the arch is beveled to perform a hemiarch replacement ([Fig. 24.6](#page-9-0)). A Dacron graft with a single 8-mm reperfusion branch is tailored and anastomosed using 4-0 polypropylene sutures, with meticulous care to avoid iatrogenic intimal tears. Reinforcement of the anastomosis with Teflon felt is often performed by incorporating a felt band between the intima and adventitia (so-called neomedia) or external to the aortic wall. Alternatively, the adventitia may be trimmed 1 to 2 cm longer than the level of the intima edge and subsequently inverted in the aortic lumen and tacked to the aortic wall using running 5-0 polypropylene sutures.14 The distal anastomosis is then performed with or without external Teflon reinforcement. The authors do not use glue to bond the dissected aortic wall because of the risk of embolization or late aortic wall necrosis.15 In type II DeBakey dissection, a hematoma extending along the arch is usually found. In such cases, the anastomosis should be performed, if feasible, in aortic tissue free of dissection and hematoma. Subadventitial hematoma removal with aortic tissue approximation should be considered in a subset of patients with extensive hematoma within the mid and distal arches. Once the anastomosis is completed, de-airing of the graft is performed, the graft is clamped, and CPB is resumed through the axillary graft in the absence of dissection within the innominate artery or, more commonly, through the side branch of the Dacron graft using the second branch of the arterial line (see [Fig. 24.6B\)](#page-9-0). Distal line hemostasis is secured using pledgeted polypropylene sutures, and rewarming to normothermia is initiated.

- ◆ In the presence of a tear within the arch, incorporation of the tear within the aortic resection is done, when feasible. With complex aortic tears or in the presence of a dilated arch (> 5-5, 5 cm) a complete arch replacement should be considered. The decision should be individualized to the patient's overall condition and the surgeon's experience. Although high-volume centers have reported excellent results for extended arch replacement procedures during type A dissection, these repairs require expertise and should be performed by surgeons with experience in nonurgent patients.
- ◆ In case a full arch resection is required, the authors prefer initially to revascularize the arch vessels using a trifurcated graft. If feasible, the distal anastomosis is performed proximal to the left subclavian artery, thus facilitating the anastomosis and minimizing recurrent and phrenic nerve injuries. In such a case, the left subclavian artery is ligated proximally and revascularized in situ or extraanatomically through the left thorax over the second rib to the left axillary artery ([Fig. 24.7\)](#page-11-0).16

# **6. Proximal Aortic Repair**

- ◆ Once the distal anastomosis has been completed, the aortic root is inspected for extension of the dissection process within the root, disease of the aortic valve, and aortic root diameter. In the absence of aortic root dilation (root < 5 cm), significant aortic valve pathology, connective tissue disorder, or tears extending close to the coronary ostia, the root may be preserved. The ascending aorta is trimmed just above the sinotubular junction. Clot present in the false lumen should be removed. Commissural prolapse is corrected by resuspending the three commissures at the sinotubular level using 4-0 pledgeted sutures ([Fig. 24.8A](#page-13-0)). The proximal anastomosis is performed by trimming the arch graft to the desired length or by sewing a new graft, generally no more than 4 mm larger than the aortic annulus, followed by a graft to graft anastomosis to the arch graft. The proximal anastomosis may be reinforced with Teflon felt, as described for the arch repair (see [Fig. 24.8B](#page-13-0)).
- ◆ In the presence of a diseased aortic valve, a standard aortic valve replacement is performed and the root preserved, if feasible.
- ◆ Occasionally, the noncoronary sinus is fragile and extensively damaged by the dissection process. With such a finding, the authors usually resect the noncoronary sinus. A tongue equidistant to the length of the resected sinus may be fashioned in the proximal graft and used to replace the sinus. The author prefers initially to replace the resected sinus with an isolated tongue graft and subsequently perform the proximal anastomosis at the sinotubular level (see [Fig. 24.8C](#page-13-0)). This facilitates maintaining the symmetry of the sinus and valve geometry. Anastomosis is performed using 4-0 polypropylene SH-1 suture-anchoring stitches in healthy tissue at the base of the leaflet. Care should be taken to lay the Dacron graft within the aorta to enhance hemostasis.
- ◆ In case of a dilated root (> 5 cm), an extensive dissection within the root, especially in the vicinity of the coronary ostia, or in the presence of a connective tissue disorder, a root replacement should be performed. Selection of the type of conduit should be based according to the patient's age, history of bleeding, and aortic annulus size. In experienced hands, a valve-sparing root procedure may be advocated for young patients, particularly in the presence of a connective tissue disorder. Dissected coronary buttons should be approximated and reinforced using O-shaped Teflon felt (see [Fig. 24.8D\)](#page-13-0). Occasionally, reconstruction of the right coronary artery is tedious and dangerous. A vein graft interposition with ligation of the right coronary ostium should be considered in such a setting, especially if a preoperative right coronary artery malperfusion was suspected.

#### **Step 4. Postoperative Care**

- ◆ Because of extended CPB time, coagulopathy, and fragile suture lines, bleeding may become a significant issue. Securing hemostasis and suture lines and the administration of allogenic blood products usually solve most bleeding problems. In cases of diffuse bleeding with no surgical cause, off-label administration of recombinant factor VIIa may be considered.
- ◆ Once the operation is completed, one should assess the arterial pulses in all extremities. Furthermore, malperfusion identified preoperatively should be evaluated for organ reperfusion. Visceral malperfusion may require on the table or early angiography with stent placement in case of persistent static malperfusion.
- ◆ Blood pressure control is mandatory early and late after the procedure. Early blood pressure control (target systolic blood pressure < 120 mm Hg) reduces anastomotic tension and blood loss. Postdischarge blood pressure control is key to ensure optimal remodeling of the distal dissected aortic segments in patients with DeBakey type I dissection, thus minimizing the risk of early distal aortic dilation.

◆ Imaging surveillance is important to assess the integrity of the proximal aortic repair and exclude dilation of the residual dissected aortic segments. The authors usually obtain a baseline thoracoabdominal CT angiogram before discharge if the creatine level is within normal range, with follow-up CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at 6, 12, and 24 months. Thereafter, CT or MRI scans are obtained annually in patients with increasing aortic diameter; the interval may be extended to 18 to 24 months in patients with stable disease. In procedures in which the native aortic valve was spared, assessment of the aortic valve before discharge, at 1 year postoperatively, and every 2 years thereafter is advisable.

#### **Step 5. Pearls and Pitfalls**

- ◆ In the presence of aortic tamponade, the patient should be brought urgently to the operating room. While a team dissects the femoral vessels for CPB initiation, another surgical team should open the sternum, and a pinpoint perforation of the pericardium should be performed with the electrocautery. Often, this will allow decompression of the intrapericardial pressure and partially relieve the tamponade, permitting time for femoral cannulation.
- ◆ In case of obvious and severe organ malperfusion, one may choose to revascularize the jeopardized organ early. Early bypass with reperfusion of an occluded carotid artery or bypass of a malperfused right coronary artery may be considered in the presence of preoperative clinical signs suggesting severe organ compromise.
- ◆ In the presence of regional myocardial dysfunction after CPB weaning, significant coronary artery stenosis should be considered; addition of a bypass graft may relieve the regional myocardial dysfunction.
- ◆ Thrombosis of the false lumen distal to the aortic repair after type I DeBakey dissection is the most important prognostic factor to avoid late distal aortic dilation. Unfortunately, in most cases, the false lumen remains patent with a standard hemiarch procedure because of the presence of multiple distal reentries. Novel procedures using antegrade deployment of thoracic stent grafts during circulatory arrest have been demonstrated to promote false lumen thrombosis.17 Optimal patient selection and the increased morbidity related to the procedure remain to be assessed.
- ◆ The field of endovascular thoracic stent grafting is rapidly evolving. The use of short grafts to treat nonoperative candidates with type A dissection have been reported. Refinement in technology and optimal patient selection will better delineate the usefulness of these emerging technologies.
