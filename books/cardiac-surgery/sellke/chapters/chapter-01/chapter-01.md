# Surgical Incisions

Hiroshi Seki and Dai Une

- ◆ The median sternotomy was reintroduced by Julian in 1957, which was already described by Milton in 1897.1 The median sternotomy has become a gold standard approach for cardiac procedures, with subsequent developments in cardiac surgery. The skin incision could be shortened caudally or cranially up to half the length of the sternum. This approach allows excellent access to every cardiac chamber and to vessels entering and leaving the medial mediastinum. It could also be extended laterally through the ribs into the intercostal space, which allows extension of the procedure to the distal arch and descending aorta, if required.
- ◆ Another approach is the thoracotomy. Ludwig Rehn, in Frankfurt, Germany, is noted as the first surgeon who successfully placed a suture through a left-sided thoracotomy. This was done in 1896 on the heart of a 22-year-old gardener's assistant, who was injured after a stabbing.2
- ◆ A thoracotomy can be divided into anterior and posterior thoracotomies, depending on the surgical procedure required. The anterior approach allows good access to the internal mammary artery and to the coronary vessels and heart valves. The posterior thoracotomy requires a lateral decubitus position and enables access to the descending aorta and distal aortic arch. During thoracoabdominal aortic surgery, this incision could be extended and combined with a pararectal incision and entry into the retroperitoneum.
- ◆ The choice of incision is influenced by certain factors, such as urgency of the procedure, nature and extent of the procedure, and possibility or necessity of extension of the procedure. A history of previous cardiac or thoracic procedures, comorbidities of the patient, patient's preference, and cosmetic aspects are other factors.
- ◆ Diabetes, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the use of bilateral mammary arteries are known risk factors of a sternal wound infection. These factors may influence the decision of which incision to use and the method of closure.

#### Full Sternotomy

- ◆ The most essential consideration in performing a sternotomy is that it is done through the midline. The suprasternal notch and xyphoid process are used as landmarks. The latter sometimes has an asymmetric configuration and therefore it is helpful to control the edge of the ribs on both sides to find the middle. A paramedian sternotomy may be harmful to the sternum and is a significant risk factor for sternum instability, which could lead to disturbances in wound healing.
- ◆ The patient is placed supine on the operating table. A linear incision is made from just above the sternal angle to the level of the xiphoid process. Subcutaneous fat and presternal fascia are divided, and the linea alba is divided inferiorly about 2 to 3 cm to obtain adequate exposure of the pericardium ([Fig. 1.1\)](#page-3-0). It is essential to divide the interclavicular ligament at the top of the suprasternal notch using electrocautery. Special attention should be taken to identify the veins crossing this area—the jugular venous arch. Injury of the veins in this area could injure other important structures, such as the trachea or brachiocephalic artery, if the bleeding is not controlled, especially if the view is limited due to small incisions. There are also veins crossing the upper part of the xyphoid cartilage, which should be identified and cauterized. The midline of the sternum is marked by electrocautery. Scissors could be used to divide the xyphoid process separately. The sternum is divided with a saw in a caudocranial fashion, with close attention paid to staying on the midline. The sternum could be also be divided in a craniocaudal fashion, changing the direction of the saw blade.
- ◆ It is prudent to ask the anesthesiologist to stop the mechanical ventilation to avoid unnecessary opening of the pleura with the saw. The saw should be lifted slightly against the posterior plate of the sternum, and care should be taken to avoid injury to the pericardium, thymus, and innominate vein. If the peritoneum is opened accidentally, it is important to close the peritoneum expeditiously to avoid fluid incorporation and subsequent adhesion in the peritoneum. Extension of the incision cranially facilitates exposure of the arch and supraaortic vessels. On the other hand, the gastroepiploic artery could be harvested, extending the incision into the peritoneal space.
- ◆ In patients with previous cardiac procedures, extra attention must be paid not to injure the cardiac structures, which could lead to hemorrhagic shock or an air embolism, with lethal consequences. Careful blunt dissection may be performed below the xyphoid process to free the pericardial and pleural adhesions. Gentle elevation of the sternum with sharp hooks or unloading and establishing a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) over the femoral vessels may be advisable in select cases as a safeguard. In case of redo, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are helpful imaging modalities to evaluate the risk of reentry.
- ◆ After sternum division, hemostasis is obtained by cauterizing the periosteal surface of the sternum. Bone wax may be used to seal the bone marrow and control bleeding, although some surgeons prefer to simply apply a towel.
- ◆ In redo cases, it is crucial to dissect the attachment to the edge of the sternum before retracting because the retraction could injure structures, such as the lung or innominate vein through tension.

#### **Step 2. Partial Sternotomy**

- ◆ An upper or lower partial sternotomy may be used for certain procedures, such as isolated aortic or mitral valve repair or replacement or bypass surgery with certain target vessels. The sternum could be divided into different patterns through the third or fourth intercostal space—J shape, L shape, or inverted T shape ([Fig. 1.2](#page-6-0)). The fourth intercostal space usually enables a good exposure of the aorta and root to be obtained. Access to the right atrium could be limited, which makes direct insertion of the venous cannula into the appendage of the right atrium laborious. It is important to have the option to cannulate the femoral vein if exposure of the right atrium is not sufficient, especially in the case of a smaller incision through the third intercostal space. Venting through the pulmonary artery may be useful in select cases with limited access to the upper right pulmonary vein.
- ◆ A small incision has the advantage of reducing the wound area and preventing wound infections due to sternum instability, reducing the requirement for a blood transfusion, and shortening the stay in the intensive care unit. Small incisions are also preferred by the patients for cosmetic reasons.

# **Step 3. Sternotomy Closure**

- ◆ At the end of the procedure, chest drains are placed through separate stab incisions at the epigastrium. Care must be taken so that the drain passes through the fascia of the rectus muscle, avoiding the epigastric pedicle. If necessary, chest drains for the pleura should be placed through the fifth or sixth intercostal space or through a subcostal tunnel from a stab incision below the costal arch.
- ◆ After thorough hemostasis and placement of chest drains, the sternum is closed using six to eight stainless steel wires. Consideration for ensuring the stability of the manubrium is essential. The risk of cutting by wires could be reduced through placement of the wires through the intercostal space. Care should be taken to stay close to the edge to minimize the risk of injury to the internal thoracic artery. Bands or plates could be used as an alternative to the wires to stabilize a fragile sternum with osteoporosis, or a paramedian sternotomy could be carried out in select cases.
- ◆ The insertion sites of the wires are controlled for bleeding. The wires are tied individually or by putting two together in a figure-of-eight fashion. Reinforcement of the sternum edge is advisable in case of asymmetric division of the sternum by placing an extralongitudinal wire at both sides of the sternum to avoid cutting through the wire, as proposed by Robicsek et al.3 ([Fig. 1.3](#page-6-1)). Wire tips are then buried in the presternal fascia. The linea alba is closed using running or interrupted fascia closure sutures, and the subcutaneous tissue is closed using absorbable sutures. Skin closure is performed using subcuticular sutures or skin staples.

#### **Thoracotomy**

#### **Step 1. Approaches in Thoracotomy**

- ◆ A right anterolateral thoracotomy incision may be used for mitral and tricuspid valve repair or replacement, aortic valve replacement, atrial septum defect repairs, and right-sided pulmonary vein isolation procedures for atrial fibrillation. The right anterior thoracotomy may be further divided into a supramammary, usually through the second intercostal space, and a submammary, usually through the fourth or fifth intercostal space.
- ◆ The right-sided supramammary anterior thoracotomy allows good access to the aortic valve. In most cases, the second or third rib needs to be detached from the sternum, and the right internal thoracic artery would need to be sacrificed. Using a thoracoscope and aortic clamp, with a Chitwood clamp through another site, can provide better exposure of the operative field. In such cases, the detachment of the rib and sacrifice of the internal thoracic artery may not be necessary. This approach is reported to be useful in all aortic valve cases,4 especially in patients with an elongated aorta, in which the ascending aorta is shifted to the right; this would exacerbate an approach through a partial sternotomy.
- ◆ A right submammary thoracotomy allows an approach to the lower part of the heart, including the mitral and tricuspid valves. A right submammary anterolateral thoracotomy can be an alternative approach for mitral valve procedures; it may be the desirable approach in the setting of a high-risk sternal reentry. A small right thoracotomy can be used for other procedures on the tricuspid valve, for closure of an atrial septal defect, or for tumor resection using a minimally invasive technique. Technologic advancements and new developments in instruments, video-assisted vision, and additional femoral access for the CPB have facilitated minimal incisions, with preserved quality of the surgical repair, similar to that achieved by a traditional sternotomy.5 Minimization of the incision is cosmetically attractive and prevents wound complications of the sternum in high-risk patients. On the other hand, complications such as lung hernia and lymph fistula, as may be found particularly with this method, have been reported.
- ◆ A left-sided submammary anterolateral thoracotomy through the fourth or fifth intercostal space can be used for coronary artery bypass surgery or pericardial window. A lower incision and approach through the fifth intercostal space enables excellent access to the apex of the heart and can be used for transapical aortic valve implantation. It can also be used for implantation of the inflow part of a left ventricular assist device within the pericardial space. A small left anterior thoracotomy incision can be used for single-vessel coronary artery bypass to the anterior coronary circulation, as well as for multivessel coronary revascularization in select cases (see Chapter 5). Compared with off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), CABG through a small left thoracotomy has resulted in less wound infection, less transfusion, and earlier recovery.6
- ◆ A posterior left-sided lateral thoracotomy is used for descending aortic procedures, and this incision can be extended, dividing the rib cage to get exposure of the supra- and infradiaphragm part of the aorta. It provides good access to the left heart bypass. Occasionally, this approach may be used for grafting to isolated lesions of the circumflex coronary artery territory from the descending aorta in situations in which sternal entry carries high risk.

#### **Step 2. Operative Steps**

#### Supramammary Anterolateral Thoracotomy

◆ The patient is placed supine on the operating table and the ipsilateral side is elevated 30 to 45 degrees with the arm placed at the side. An incision is made above the upper edge of the third rib, and the pectoralis major and minor muscles are divided using electrocautery [\(Fig.](#page-10-0)  [1.4](#page-10-0)). The desired intercostal space (mostly second, occasionally third) is entered after dividing the intercostal muscles on top of the rib and the rib is disattached from the sternum using an oscillating saw and then pushed into the thoracic space to facilitate exposure. The right internal thoracic artery should be detected and sacrificed with metal clips at this step. With assistance of a video scope and an extra site for the aortic clamp, the supramammary incision could be shifted lateral and the procedure could be performed through the intercostal space without resection and dislocation of the rib.

### Submammary Anterolateral Thoracotomy

◆ The patient is placed supine on the operating table, and the ipsilateral side is elevated 30 to 45 degrees, with the patient's arm placed at the side. A submammary incision is made, and the pectoralis major muscle is divided using electrocautery [\(Fig. 1.5\)](#page-10-1). The serratus anterior muscle is divided using electrocautery. The dorsal latissimus muscle could be divided or retracted and preserved as well. The desired intercostal space (fourth or fifth) is entered after dividing the intercostal muscles on top of the rib to avoid injury of the intercostal neurovascular bundle. A partial rib resection may be performed to facilitate exposure.

#### Posterolateral Thoracotomy

- ◆ The patient is placed in the lateral decubitus position, with a roll placed underneath the dependent axilla. After the patient is secured to the operating table and adequate cushioning is provided to dependent areas, the upper arm is extended anteriorly and cephalad.
- ◆ A curvilinear incision is started in the submammary region and extended posterolaterally, traversing 1 to 2 cm below the tip of the scapula and extending craniad midway between the spine and scapula ([Fig. 1.6](#page-10-2)).
- ◆ The subcutaneous tissue and trapezius muscles are divided using electrocautery. The serratus anterior muscle is divided but may be preserved and retracted. The latissimus dorsi muscle is similarly retracted away from the surgical field. The incision may be continued posteriorly up to the level of the paraspinous muscle.
- ◆ The thoracic cavity may be entered through the fourth or fifth interspace at the top of the rib to avoid the intercostal neurovascular bundle. A partial rib resection may be performed to facilitate exposure.

in lateral decubitus position. The groin is slightly rotated to maintain access to the femoral vessels.

# **Thoracotomy Closure**

- ◆ Chest drains are placed two rib spaces below the entry site. It is helpful to grab the muscle with a clamp and hold it under retraction by insertion to keep enough muscle in the proper position for closure. Pericostal sutures are placed around the ribs, avoiding the under edge of the ribs and intercostal neurovascular bundle. Loosening of this suture could lead to a lung hernia or invagination of the lung if it is not tied properly.
- ◆ The divided muscle layers are reapproximated using Vicryl sutures. It is important to identify the firm fascia of the muscle to secure the reapproximation. The skin is closed with subcuticular sutures or skin staples.

# **Further Considerations**

#### **Step 1. Combination of Minimally Invasive Incisions**

◆ An intrapericardial implantation of a left ventricular assist device in the younger patient could be performed through a combination of an upper partial sternotomy and a left anterolateral thoracotomy. This procedure possibly reduces intrapericardial adhesion and facilitates the heart transplantation.

#### **Step 2. Other Incisions**

◆ Other incisions are used occasionally for extended exposure of the great vessels. The clamshell approach [\(Fig. 1.7](#page-13-0)) enables access to the hilum of each lung and is an option for bilateral lung transplantation or heart-lung transplantation. This approach provides an excellent exposure of the heart and descending aorta, and may be used for select cases that require extended aortic surgery.

**Figure 1.7** By the clamshell approach, the sternum is transversally divided at the level between the 3rd and 5th intercostal space. The upper part of the thorax is opened like a clamshell with retractors. Sternum wires and PDS pericostal sutures are used to close and stabilize the thorax at the end of the procedure.
