  - ◆ Since the first implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) by Dr. Michael DeBakey in 1966, the search for durable short- and long-term mechanical support has resulted in a myriad of devices and expanded indications. Targeted funding by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and industry has resulted in several innovative technologies with which the surgeon must be familiar in order to recommend appropriate mechanical support therapy, when indicated.
  - ◆ As waiting times for transplantation lengthened, clinical experience was gained with various devices. Today, pulsatile and nonpulsatile mechanical circulatory support devices are increasingly being used as bridges to transplantation and as destination therapy. The ReMATCH trial has shown that LVADs have a permanent place as destination therapy in end-stage heart failure.1 In this chapter, we describe techniques used for the implantation of various common devices for temporary and durable ventricular support in heart failure.

## **Step 1. Surgical Anatomy**

◆ The anatomy of pump insertion is similar for most devices discussed in this chapter. The inlet cannula of both externally and internally placed LVADs is usually implanted in the left ventricular apex. The diaphragmatic surface of the left ventricle between the ventricular septum and the origin of the papillary muscles for the inlet cannula or pump can also be used [\(Fig. 32.1\)](#page-2-0). This convenient flat space is particularly suited for implantation of small centrifugal force pumps and intraabdominally placed axial flow pumps.

## **1. Indications for Use of Various Ventricular Assist Devices**

◆ Temporary ventricular assist devices are typically used in the setting of acute left or right ventricular dysfunction or for univentricular support for interventional procedures. Devices are available that can be placed percutaneously via open vascular exposure or via mediastinal access. Temporary ventricular assist devices can be deployed rapidly in various clinical locations (e.g., intensive care unit [ICU], operating room [OR], or catheterization laboratory). A variety of devices are commercially available, including the Impella (Abiomed, Danvers, MA) series of left and right ventricular assist devices that provides temporary axial flow support in a low-profile device. The Impella 2.5 and Impella CP ([Fig. 32.2](#page-5-0)) can be inserted percutaneously, or the higher flow Impella 5.0 [\(Fig. 32.3\)](#page-5-1) can be inserted via right axillary or femoral cut-down for higher flows. The newly released Impella RP ([Fig. 32.4\)](#page-5-2) is intended for right heart support via percutaneous venous access.2 Numerous extracorporeal centrifugal pumps (e.g., CentriMag [Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA] or Tandem heart) are available for left and/or right ventricular support ([Fig. 32.5](#page-5-3)). We currently prefer to use the CentriMag in our institution because of its relative ease of use and the ability to splice in cardiotomy reservoirs for transfusion, oxygenators, and renal replacement devices.3 There is an ever-increasing number of patients who present with acute, acute on chronic, or chronic heart failure that require temporary or durable mechanical circulatory support. This chapter provides an overview of the major temporary and durable ventricular assist devices that are currently available. Descriptions of the indications and implantation techniques are outlined.

◆ For long-term implantable support, the HeartMate II (Thoratec) and HeartWare HVAD (HeartWare, Framingham, MA) are the two current continuous-flow devices that are most commonly used. The HeartMate II ([Fig. 32.6](#page-8-0)) is an axial flow pump requiring implantation in the abdomen, whereas the HeartWare HVAD [\(Fig. 32.7\)](#page-8-1) is a centrifugal pump that is implanted within the pericardium itself. Other implantable LVADs are also available either commercially or on a trial basis.

# **Step 3. Operative Steps**

#### **1. External Temporary Devices**

Impella

◆ The Impella 2.5 and Impella CP devices are regularly inserted using a percutaneous access technique either in the cardiac catheterization laboratory or the OR. Femoral arterial access is obtained using the Seldinger technique, the artery is dilated up, and a tear-away sheath is placed. The Impella device is then inserted after priming, guided into the left ventricle, and positioned across the aortic valve under fluoroscopic and/or echocardiographic guidance. After adequate positioning is obtained, the automated controller is activated, and an appropriate power level is selected for the desired cardiac output.

- ◆ Insertion of the Impella 5.0 is performed via either a femoral cut-down technique with direct arterial cannulation or, more commonly at our institution, an axillary artery cut-down technique ([Fig. 32.8](#page-11-0)).4 We prefer to place an 8- to 10-mm tube graft on the axillary artery with 4-0 polypropylene sutures and cannulate the graft with the Impella 5.0 device. The device is then advanced and positioned as previously described using intraoperative fluoroscopy and echocardiography. We prefer to close the cut-down site with layers of interrupted sutures to help prevent bleeding and infection while the device is in place.
- ◆ If short-term temporary right ventricular assist is needed, the new Impella RP device can be placed percutaneously for right ventricular assistance. The device is advanced from the femoral vein up through the inferior vena cava (IVC) and positioned with the tip of the device in the main pulmonary artery under fluoroscopic and echocardiographic guidance.

# CentriMag

- ◆ The CentriMag is a versatile temporary support device that lends itself to several cannulation configurations, depending on the clinical circumstances. For left ventricular support, we prefer to cannulate the left ventricular apex for the inflow portion. For postcardiotomy support (or for those undergoing sternotomy for implantation), we graft the ascending aorta for the outflow. For patients requiring LVAD support for cardiogenic shock who otherwise do not require sternotomy, we routinely perform a left thoracotomy for cannulation of the apex; the outflow graft is constructed using a right axillary artery cut-down. For the inflow in either circumstance, the apex of the left ventricle is elevated, and two circumferential purse-string sutures of 2-0 Teflon polypropylene are placed. In general, a site should be chosen that will center the cannula tip coaxial to and in the center of the left ventricular cavity. The size of the drainage cannula should be chosen based on the patient's size. The cannula is tunneled out of the chest through a subcutaneous tunnel, ensuring that there is no kinking of the tubing. The cannula tip is inserted into the left ventricle through a cruciate incision and secured by purse-string sutures to the cannula. Securing the inlet cannula in position is critical to prevent cannula dislodgment, which can result in bleeding and the development of a catastrophic air embolus during pumping. Transesophageal echocardiography is used to confirm acceptable inlet cannula position.
- ◆ For patients undergoing sternotomy, a partial aortic clamp is applied to the aorta in a location devoid of calcifications and plaques. A 10-mm tube graft is placed in an end-to-side fashion. The anastomosis is performed to the ascending aorta with 4-0 polypropylene sutures.
- ◆ If the left thoracotomy approach is used for inflow cannulation, the right axillary artery is exposed for outflow grafting. After isolating the axillary artery, a 10-mm graft is sewn to the artery in an end-to-side fashion, and the CentriMag circuit is attached directly to the graft and secured with several silk ties and sutures. The graft is either tunneled via a separate incision or through the cut-down incision, depending on the orientation of the graft to avoid kinking. To limit overflow to the ipsilateral arm, a snare is adjusted to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 70 mm Hg in the ipsilateral arterial line. We then close the incision in layers temporarily to limit bleeding and infection risks.

- ◆ If right ventricular assist is needed, we prefer to use a percutaneous dual-stage venous cannula placed via the femoral vein under echocardiographic guidance. This provides excellent drainage of the right atrium; if additional drainage is needed, a percutaneous superior vena cava (SVC) cannula can be placed via the right internal jugular vein. We perform a sternotomy and place a 10-mm tube graft on the right pulmonary artery, directly between the SVC and the aorta, using 4-0 polypropylene sutures ([Fig. 32.9](#page-14-0)). We have found that this position of the outflow graft provides good flow dynamics bilaterally and minimizes pulmonary regurgitation. It is also readily exposed via this approach.
- ◆ Removal of the device is straightforward in each of the previous approaches. For the graft sites, we simply use a GIA stapler to staple off the grafts and then oversew using 4-0 polypropylene sutures.

#### **2. Internal Axial Flow Pump**

- ◆ The HeartMate II is implanted through a median sternotomy with the patient supported by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). A cylindric blade is used to excise a circular plug of myocardium near the ventricular apex. Horizontal mattressed 2-0 pledgetted Ti-Cron sutures are placed circumferentially around the ventricular opening. These sutures are used to secure the HeartMate II sewing ring to the margins of the opening [\(Fig. 32.10](#page-14-1)). The ventricular cavity should be inspected digitally and visually to ensure that no ventricular muscle or clot could embolize or interfere with device placement. The ventricular assist device (VAD) is placed within the sewing cuff and secured with heavy braided sutures.5
- ◆ The body of the pump is typically placed in a supradiaphragmatic pocket in the left chest. The location of the pocket can be patient-dependent based on factors such as body habitus and previous abdominal surgeries. The pocket is created by lysing the anterior attachments of the diaphragm, which can be accomplished with electrocautery or endothoracic staples. Careful attention to hemostasis is necessary to minimize the risk of postoperative bleeding. It is imperative that the pocket is large enough for the VAD to sit without tension or risk of movement with chest closure. A plastic model of the VAD profile is available to check for pocket size.
- ◆ The driveline is tunneled from the middle mediastinum and brought through the anterior fascia and subcutaneous space to a predetermined exit site in the left or right upper quadrant of the abdomen. The tract is created and the driveline tunneled with a tunneling device specific for the HeartMate II. The velour of the driveline is tunneled to the skin exit site.
- ◆ The outflow graft is attached to the pump and sutured to the ascending aorta with 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene sutures and positioned on the anterior or arterial lateral surface of the ascending aorta. A partial aortic cross-clamp is used to isolate this area of the ascending aorta. The outflow graft is de-aired prior to initiation of the VAD. This can be accomplished either with a needle de-airing site or a formal de-airing cannula.
- ◆ The left ventricle should be well filled before pump flow is initiated. The pump is started at 6000 rpm, and the speed is gradually increased until the patient is weaned from CPB. Appropriate inotropic support is initiated for right ventricular support, as necessary. Final VAD speed is set based on the desired output and biventricular (septal) geometry.

## **3. Internal Centrifugal Flow Pump**

HeartWare HVAD

◆ The HeartWare HVAD is a continuous-flow LVAD that is implantable within the pericardium itself [\(Fig. 32.11](#page-17-0)).6 The inflow cannula is contained within the housing of the device to accomplish this. The sewing ring is secured to the left ventricle either with a technique described with the HeartMate II or with a felt strip–reinforced, running 3-0 Prolene technique. A spring-loaded coring device packaged with the HVAD is used to core the left ventricle in the center of the sewing ring. The left ventricle is inspected for clot and obstructive trabeculae, which are removed. The head of the VAD is placed within the sewing ring and locked into place by tightening the bolt on the sewing ring with a torque driver. The driveline is tunneled and the outflow graft anastomosed in a manner similar to that for the HeartMate II. After implantation, the device is initiated at 1800 rpm and increased as CPB is weaned. The final VAD speed (≈ 3000 rpm) is set based on desired pump flow and biventricular geometry and function.

## **4. Explantation Procedures for Cardiac Transplantation**

HeartWare HVAD and HeartMate II

◆ VAD explantation typically occurs at the time of orthotopic heart transplantation, VAD exchange, or left ventricular recovery. For patients who undergo LVAD implantation as a bridge to transplantation, we cover the VAD, right ventricle, and right atrium with a double layer of preclude Gore-Tex membrane (WL Gore, Newark, DE) to facilitate redo mediastinal dissection. The outflow graft is covered with a ringed Gore-Tex tube graft that is cut longitudinally to facilitate placement and prevent outflow graft compression. Redo sternotomy is performed in the standard fashion and the mediastinum exposed. The double-layer Gore-Tex membrane technique provides a nice plane to initiate the LVAD and cardiac mobilization. We place a double layer of Gore-Tex between the right atrium and the right-sided pericardium for rapid exposure to the SVC, right atrium, and IVC. Adhesions are lysed, and the aorta, SVC, and IVC are exposed and cannulated. Once CPB is initiated, the outflow graft is clamped and the pump turned off. It is imperative to clamp the outflow graft to prevent recirculation. The SVC and IVC are isolated and snared, and the aorta is cross-clamped. The cardiectomy is performed in the standard fashion, with simultaneous removal of the LVAD. The driveline is cut with wire cutters, and the internal portion of the driveline is mobilized to the level of the fascia. Once the heart transplantation is completed and the chest is closed, we remove the remaining portion of the driveline from the exit site. We attempt to remove all remnants of the LVAD outflow graft; however, there are times where the aortic transection is performed at the outflow graft site due to anatomic limitations, and a small portion of the graft is left in situ. For the Heartmate II, it is imperative that meticulous hemostasis of the abdominal pocket be obtained. Another technique for the HeartMate II is to leave the pump in situ and come back to remove the pump posttransplantation after some recovery of coagulation and function has been realized.

#### **5. Ventricular Assist Device Removal or Replacement**

- ◆ Both devices can be removed by redo sternotomy or a subcostal approach. The VAD is explanted, and the apical site is closed with a patch closure or mechanical plug placement. Alternatively, the VAD can be functionally excluded. This is accomplished by outflow graft obstruction with an Amplatzer plug and discontinuing the VAD.
- ◆ Both the HeartMate II and HVAD can be replaced via a subcostal approach.7 This technique is used mainly for LVAD failure (e.g., not outflow graft thrombus or VAD malposition). This can be performed either on or off CPB. The technique involves LVAD, proximal outflow graft, and driveline exposure. Outflow graft is clamped at the time of exchange. The VAD is removed and replaced with the new pump. The HeartMate II outflow graft is resecured with the screw mechanism, whereas the HVAD requires a graft to graft anastomosis. The new driveline is tunneled and secured. Once the new VAD is functional, the incision is closed in multiple layers.

## **Step 4. Postoperative Care**

#### **1. Extracorporeal Ventricular Assist Devices**

- ◆ Bleeding often occurs in the immediate postoperative period, particularly when CPB has been used. Mediastinal drainage tubes should be used liberally to ensure complete drainage of the mediastinum. Open chest techniques are used at my institution when exceptionally coagulopathic patients undergo these procedures, with washouts as needed.
- ◆ No anticoagulant should be given while a patient is bleeding; when the patient is stable, intravenous heparin is initiated using a specific VAD protocol to maintain the prothrombin time between 60 and 70 seconds. Alternatively, direct thrombin inhibitors such as bivalirudin can be used. Impella devices can be run with anticoagulation through the sheath only. It is important in these devices to monitor for hemolysis because prolonged device time with high power usage can result in significant hemolysis.

#### **2. HeartMate II and HeartWare HVAD**

◆ Care should be taken to avoid overdriving this pump and excessively unloading the ventricle in the postoperative period, which can induce ventricular arrhythmias, suck-down events, or septal distortion (right ventricular distortion leading to right ventricular dysfunction). Patients can be particularly volume-responsive during this period and may benefit from crystalloid or blood transfusion. Right heart failure is a concern in select patients, and proper inotropic therapy and even temporary right ventricular assist device (RVAD) support may be required.

## **Step 5. Pearls and Pitfalls**

## **1. Impella Devices**

- ◆ Arterial injury may result from the percutaneous placement of these devices. After discontinuation, one must follow up to ensure that no arterial injury or pseudoaneurysm has developed.8
- ◆ Ensure the security of these devices to the skin as well as to the vasculature if a cut-down is used. Slight movements can result in malpositioning of the cannula, damage to valve structures, and decreased support.

#### **2. CentriMag**

◆ These devices can have cardiotomy reservoirs and dialysis filters spliced inline, which can be extraordinarily useful. However, one must be extremely vigilant to ensure that air is not introduced into the system using one of these adjuncts.

#### **3. Continuous-Flow Pumps**

◆ The aortic anastomoses and graft anastomoses for continuous-flow pumps have a tendency to bleed. The needle point for de-airing must also be carefully closed because this can serve as a site of postoperative bleeding. The area can be wrapped with Surgicel (Johnson & Johnson, Somerville, NJ) or with a circumferential graft.

#### **4. Explantation**

◆ When either the HeartWare HVAD or HeartMate II is removed, the pump should be stopped at the time of institution of CPB, or the low pressure in the ventricle may allow the pump to entrain air. Clamping the outflow graft at the time of CPB initiation prevents recirculation into the left ventricle.
