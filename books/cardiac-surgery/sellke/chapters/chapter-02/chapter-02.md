# Cannulation Techniques for Cardiopulmonary Bypass

Hadi Toeg and Fraser D. Rubens

# **Step 1. Surgical Anatomy**

#### **1. Ascending Aorta**

- ◆ Cannulation sites on the ascending aorta should be as high as safely possible. Surgeons today more frequently perform complete arterial revascularization, which in some cases may require delicate proximal anastomoses of arterial conduits (e.g., free internal thoracic arteries, radial arteries) directly to the aorta. These anastomoses are more difficult to construct if the aorta is under tension and distorted, such as may occur with a partial occluding clamp. A landmark for cannulation that is consistently successful for this approach is the pericardial reflection on the left anterolateral surface of the aorta, just below the innominate vein ([Fig. 2.1\)](#page-2-0). This reflection can be divided to expose an area approximately 1 cm in diameter.
- ◆ Higher sites of cannulation (arch) may be desirable in cases of demonstrated aortic disease, and this form of cannulation may be associated with fewer neurologic problems.1 If there is extensive aortic disease or a hemiarch replacement is considered, the innominate artery can also be cannulated.2

## **2. Femoral and Iliac Vessels**

- ◆ It is essential that all trainees be familiar with the anatomy of the common femoral artery, with emphasis on its branches and its relationship to the inguinal ligament and common femoral vein ([Fig. 2.2\)](#page-2-1). We believe that it is critical to identify the superficial femoral and profunda femoris arteries to ensure cannulation of the common femoral artery proper.
- ◆ In some cases, part of the inguinal ligament may need to be divided to provide safe control of the proximal aspect of the vessel. However, this is not commonly required because of the availability of easier sites for cannulation (e.g., axillary artery).

# **3. Axillary Artery**

◆ Cardiac surgeons should also be familiar with the pertinent anatomy of the axillary artery. In particular, the axillary vein is anterosuperior to the artery, and the brachial plexus is posterolateral ([Fig. 2.3](#page-4-0)).

### **Step 2. Preoperative Considerations**

- ◆ It is essential to identify prospective cannulation sites, even when off-pump surgery is contemplated, and to communicate this plan with the anesthetist to allow for appropriate monitoring (e.g., arterial monitoring of both upper extremities).
- ◆ The surgeon must anticipate vascular access problems in patients with vascular pathology and in those with cerebrovascular disease. Bilateral blood pressure recording to detect subclavian stenosis is essential for every patient. The lower extremity vascular assessment should also be thorough to prepare for a potential femoral artery cannulation. Patients with absent femoral pulses should undergo vascular imaging to evaluate the size and quality of the lower vessels and patency of the abdominal aorta. A previous history of lower or upper extremity deep vein thrombosis must be elicited.
- ◆ The surgeon should assess the ascending aorta on the chest radiograph and angiogram. If there is any concern, echocardiography or computed tomography of the ascending aorta should be used liberally. Intraoperative epiaortic scanning, which is used by some teams routinely to guide cannulation,3 should also be considered. Although an aortic plaque may be palpated—often at the base of the innominate artery—it is the presence of mobile plaque that is most concerning, and an off-pump so-called no-touch aorta approach should be considered in this situation, if possible.4
- ◆ High-risk patients should be appropriately draped to access alternative sites, such as the axillary artery, and the surgeon should discuss all potential approaches and strategies with the anesthetist and perfusionist before starting to ensure readiness of cannulation and appropriate monitoring lines.
- ◆ Finally, with regard to venous cannulation, our practice has been to use two single-stage cannulae for all cases except simple coronary artery bypass. This provides the greatest flexibility if the operative strategy has to be modified midway through surgery (e.g., open insertion of a retrograde cannula, retrograde cerebral perfusion, control of an inadvertent opening of the right atrium with a left atriotomy).

## **Step 3. Operative Steps**

#### **1. Arterial Cannulation**

#### Ascending Aortic Cannulation

- ◆ The target area should be digitally palpated. The cannula should be inserted so that its flow direction and jet are away from the arch vessels ([Fig. 2.4](#page-6-0)).
- ◆ Two sets of purse-string sutures (braided nonabsorbable 2-0) are placed around the target (8 to 10 mm diameter), with the free ends controlled with tourniquets on each side.
- ◆ There are several options for the actual cannulation, using a no. 15 or no. 11 blade. Some surgeons prefer to incise transmurally and control the opening with their finger, passing the tip of the cannula under the digit into the aortic opening [\(Fig. 2.5](#page-6-1)). Some cut in an oblique manner but control the resulting flap with the forceps, directing the cannula under control into the opening. Another elegant method involves incising only the adventitia and media, leaving the paper-thin intima to be punctured by the cannula ([Fig. 2.6](#page-6-2)).

#### Femoral Artery Cannulation

- ◆ The safest skin incision for femoral cannulation is a vertical incision overlying and just slightly medial to the femoral pulse [\(Fig. 2.7\)](#page-6-3). An alternative incision is a slightly oblique incision aligned with the inguinal ligament to facilitate healing.
- ◆ Lymphatic vessels should be carefully cauterized or ligated to prevent the formation of a lymphocele and persistent drainage.

**Figure 2.7**

- ◆ Proximal and distal control of the femoral artery should be obtained. A target site for the arteriotomy should be chosen after considering where the proximal clamp may be safely placed and how the repair will be accomplished when the cannula is removed [\(Fig. 2.8, A](#page-8-0)). The distal vessels may be occluded with separate clamps or tapes (see [Fig. 2.8, B](#page-8-0)).
- ◆ The arteriotomy should be made in a transverse fashion and the femoral cannula gently introduced while an assistant releases the proximal clamp. The cannula is then secured by tying it to the proximal snare, with a second suture securing the tubing to the surface of the thigh.

#### Axillary Artery Cannulation

- ◆ A 5- to 8-cm transverse incision is made about 2 cm below the clavicle, overlying the deltopectoral groove ([Fig. 2.9](#page-8-1)). The dissection is continued between the fibers of the pectoralis major. There is often soft fat in this space, and the area should be dissected gently to avoid tearing of vessels and blood staining. The exposure is further aided by two self-retaining retractors. In an emergency, it is often necessary to sacrifice small nerves to the pectoralis major.
- ◆ The cephalic vein is identified in this space, where it penetrates the fascia to join the axillary vein. The clavipectoral fascia is incised, and the pectoralis minor muscle is retracted laterally or partially dissected. The axillary vein should be encircled with loops and gently retracted cephalad.
- ◆ The artery, which lies superior and deep to the vein, can be identified by palpation and then exposed and controlled proximally and distally with tapes. Arterial branches of the thoracoacromial trunk may be encountered and should be controlled with silk snares. Care must be taken to avoid touching the medial and lateral brachial plexus cords.
- ◆ After heparin is administered, the artery can be controlled with clamps, but we prefer to use a partial occluding clamp at the arteriotomy site. An 8-mm tube graft should be anastomosed to this site [\(Fig. 2.10\)](#page-8-2) and the arterial cannula inserted into the tube graft. The cannula is not advanced into the axillary artery proper, but rather perfuses from within the graft.5
- ◆ At the end of the procedure, the stump can be controlled with several very large hemoclips applied transversely and then oversewn with 4-0 polypropylene sutures.

#### Transapical Cannulation

- ◆ This technique is extremely useful in situations of severe atherosclerotic disease of the aorta (porcelain aorta) or for a type A dissection in an emergency ([Fig. 2.11\)](#page-10-0).
- ◆ Venous (right atrial) cannulation should be obtained first to allow for the rapid institution of bypass after cannulating the apex. Similarly, if possible, the right superior pulmonary vein should be cannulated first for venting because it is difficult to mobilize the heart after the cannula is in place for fear of left ventricular tearing. An easy alternative is to vent the pulmonary artery.
- ◆ Manipulation of the apex may cause instability, so the equipment should be ready before proceeding.
- ◆ A 14 F needle is inserted in the apex, and a guidewire is passed across the aortic valve with transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) guidance. A laparotomy pad is placed under the left ventricular apex to stabilize the heart.
- ◆ There is no need to predilate the opening. A wire-reinforced cannula with an inner dilator is passed over the guidewire and positioned across the aortic valve. The cannula is then connected to the circuit and de-aired, and bypass is commenced. Its position can be verified by TEE ([Fig. 2.12\)](#page-10-1).
- ◆ It is not recommended to place purse-string sutures in the epicardium until after bypass has started because beating of the heart may cause tearing. Once the heart is on bypass, however, with the heart decompressed, we place two large, braided, pledgeted purse strings, controlled with a tourniquet. The cannula is tied to these tourniquets and is also fixed to the skin to prevent motion.
- ◆ The strategy to deal with the relevant aortic pathology (e.g., dissection) should include provision of an alternative cannulation site (e.g., side graft to ascending aortic tube graft) to allow the apical cannula to be removed and the purse strings tied while the heart is flaccid. We further buttress this repair with biologic glue.

#### **2. Venous Cannulation**

# Femoral Vein Cannulation

- ◆ We prefer to use a long double-stage or multi-stage venous cannula because it may be used for definitive perfusion. We do not routinely place tapes proximally and distally, thus avoiding posterior dissection. Two purse-string sutures (4-0 polypropylene) are placed around the target, and a 14 F needle is inserted approximately 3 mm from the caudal apex of the diamond. A guidewire is inserted cephalad, up to the superior vena cava (SVC). The cannula is inserted over the wire, with further minor opening of the vein wall with a scalpel superiorly, up to 3 mm from the apex of the diamond. Further advancement of the cannula is guided by TEE to ensure that the tip is just inside the SVC.
- ◆ At the completion of the procedure, the purse strings can be gently snared as the cannula is removed and then tied, with little compromise of the femoral vein lumen.

**Figure 2.12**

#### Right Atrial Cannulation

- ◆ Usually, a double-stage venous cannula is inserted through the right atrial appendage. The edges of the atrium can be gently grasped on each side, with an incision made using a scalpel or scissors. The cannula is introduced with the tip directed posteriorly so that it is gently guided into the inferior vena cava (IVC). Occasionally, digital manipulation at the level of the IVC below the heart is necessary to guide the cannula into the correct position, with or without confirmation by TEE.
- ◆ If two single-stage venous cannulae are required, we generally place one cannula (IVC) through the atrial appendage. The second purse string is placed approximately 1.5 cm posterior and caudal to this point so that the second cannula (SVC) crosses the IVC cannula. This orientation facilitates exposure of the tricuspid valve and coronary sinus and provides good retraction of a left atriotomy when the caval cannulae are pulled to the left side of the incision. During preparation for orthotopic heart transplantation, both purse strings should be placed as posterior in the atrial wall as comfortably possible (without a crossover orientation) to allow for the preparation of an appropriate cuff of native right atrium to facilitate the atrial anastomosis.
- ◆ If necessary, snares can be placed around the SVC and IVC after gentle circumferential dissection. We do not routinely snare for mitral valve surgery.
- ◆ Direct cannulation of the SVC may be necessary, particularly with high atrial septal defects (e.g., sinus venosus). The purse string should be placed in a diamond fashion on the anterior surface of the SVC, well above the sinoatrial node, but in a location such that the snare will include flow through the azygos vein. The two sides of the purse string are held with forceps by the surgeon and assistant, and a vertical venotomy is completed. A right-angled cannula is inserted directly and twisted cephalad, and the purse strings are tightened. For orthotopic heart transplantation using bicaval cannulation, SVC cannulation can be achieved as described previously; IVC cannulation can be achieved by venous cannulation arising from the femoral vein.

#### **3. Cardioplegia Cannulation and Venting**

## Retrograde Coronary Sinus Cannulation

- ◆ A purse-string suture (4-0 polypropylene) is placed on the right atrial wall, caudal to the IVC cannulation site and about 1 cm from the atrioventricular junction, at the level of the acute margin of the right ventricle ([Fig. 2.13](#page-12-0)).
- ◆ The cannula is passed through a stab in the purse string and is rotated so that the tip abuts on the atrial septum at a point just medial to the IVC and curls toward the left shoulder as the cannula is advanced. Proper placement is indicated by easy passage of the cannula tip and by external palpation of the cannula in the coronary sinus medial to the IVC. The pressure tracing from the tip of the cannula will also be characteristic, and the position can be confirmed using TEE.
- ◆ If the cannula cannot be easily inserted, after snaring down the two single-stage cannulae, a small transverse atriotomy (1.5 cm) may be made and a purse-string suture placed around the coronary sinus ostium to secure the retrograde cannula after insertion under direct vision.

**Figure 2.13**

### Right Superior Pulmonary Vein Cannulation for Venting

- ◆ A purse-string suture (4-0 polypropylene) is placed on the right superior pulmonary vein with the medial suture line placed into the left atrium [\(Fig. 2.14](#page-14-0)).
- ◆ The vent can be placed prior to or after cross-clamp application. If the vent is placed prior to application of the cross-clamp, the surgeon must ensure that the left ventricle is not ejecting to avoid possible air embolization during vent placement.
- ◆ The venting cannula can be tailored by creating a question mark curve to allow for placement of the cannula into the left ventricle through the left atrium and mitral valve. The cannula is passed through a no. 11 blade stab in the pulmonary vein purse string, and the cannula is gently advanced in a left inferolateral direction. If feasible, the surgeon's hand can be placed behind the heart in the oblique sinus and can palpate and guide the cannula through the mitral valve.
- ◆ To achieve effective venting and minimize bleeding during aortic procedures, the cannula should sit in the left ventricle.
- ◆ Less common alternative sites for ventricular venting include the superior aspect of the left atrium, the pulmonary artery, and the foramen ovale.

#### **4. Percutaneous Cannula Placement**

Venous-Venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation

- ◆ Prior to performing venous-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), appropriately sized vessels and ECMO configuration (e.g., femoral-femoral, femoral-jugular) must be chosen to achieve maximum ECMO flow to support the patient.
- ◆ The femoral vein is punctured with an 18-G needle by palpating the femoral artery and directing the needle just medial to the artery or via ultrasound. A J-tipped guidewire is advanced through the needle and should be visualized in the right atrium–IVC junction. A series of graduated dilators are used, and the venous cannula is placed over the guidewire. A similar approach is achieved for the jugular vein.
- ◆ A novel method of achieving venous-venous ECMO is via a double-lumen catheter, which can be placed in the right jugular vein. Ultrasound-guided venous puncture of the right jugular vein is achieved with an 18-G needle, and a stiff, J-tipped guidewire is placed and should be anchored deep into the IVC. TEE is essential, but to minimize complications, fluoroscopy is required.6 A series of graduated dilators are used, and the double-lumen catheter is placed so that the upper and lower drainage holes are located at the SVC and IVC, respectively ([Fig. 2.15](#page-14-1)). The return (oxygenated blood) port is found in the mid–right atrium, and the oxygenated blood is directed toward the tricuspid valve.

#### Venous-Arterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation

- ◆ Venous cannulation is achieved as described previously, generally in the femoral vein.
- ◆ Arterial cannulation is achieved via the ultrasound-guided Seldinger technique in the common femoral artery. A small 15 F or 17 F arterial cannula should be used to allow some distal limb perfusion.
- ◆ To ensure adequate distal limb perfusion, an antegrade catheter can be placed in the superficial femoral artery, or a small retrograde catheter can be placed in the posterior tibial artery ([Fig. 2.16\)](#page-17-0).7

# **Step 4. Postoperative Care**

- ◆ Surgeons should understand the pathophysiology of cardiopulmonary bypass to recognize the broad impact of this technology on virtually every organ system.
- ◆ Effective bypass should be married to proactive blood conservation strategies, including cell salvage and the use of appropriate antifibrinolytics. Surgeons may also be expected to supervise novel related techniques, such as ultrafiltration5 and retrograde autologous priming,8 and must understand the importance of well-executed cannulation to the success of these modalities.

## **Step 5. Pearls and Pitfalls**

- ◆ Sites of arterial cannulation should be chosen with consideration about how the site of vascular entrance can be repaired should complications such as bleeding or tearing occur. For example, in the ascending aorta, the surgeon should consider whether the site chosen would be amenable to a partial occluding clamp to repair this area.
- ◆ Communication among the surgeon, perfusionist, and anesthetist is essential, particularly in complex cases. Potential strategies should be well prepared, with the appropriate equipment available in the room, in case cannulation sites change or emergency bypass needs to be initiated.
- ◆ Atrial cannulation sites should be chosen carefully, particularly in fragile tissues, in anticipation of inadvertent tearing, which can extend to the atrioventricular junction, into the second cannulation site or, if too far inferiorly, into the IVC. On the insertion of the IVC cannula, always err on directing the cannula posteriorly, "marching" the cannula slowly forward, because initial anterior forced misplacement may lead to coronary sinus perforation, which can be lethal.
- ◆ Care must be taken when encircling the SVC and IVC to prevent posterior damage of these vessels. With the SVC, the tissue overlying the right pulmonary artery between the aorta and SVC can be divided with cautery, and a right-angled instrument can be used to create the plane. Damage to the azygos vein may be extremely difficult to repair. The SVC cannula tip should be inserted only so far so that when encircled, complete drainage will occur. Similarly, care must be taken with encircling the IVC to ensure that damage to the posterior wall does not ensue. If the seal with the snare is inadequate, often a second snare will accomplish the task.
- ◆ Placement of the retrograde cannula can be facilitated by restricting venous return somewhat to fill the right atrium. This will allow entrance of the catheter into the coronary sinus by palpation or via assistance with TEE.
