# Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair for Descending Thoracic Aortic and Aortic Arch Aneurysms

Ibrahim Sultan, Joseph E. Bavaria, and Wilson Y. Szeto

## **Summary**

- ◆ Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) has become an effective treatment for various descending thoracic aortic pathologic processes, including aortic aneurysm and dissection. Although long-term outcome data for this therapy are not available, the short-term and intermediate results have been promising. Long-term data is accumulating and appears to be comparable to open surgery.
- ◆ Multiple devices have been investigated and approved in multicenter trials. Multiple iterations and advance in endograft design have helped navigate anatomic limitations. With ongoing improvements in imaging and with the development of branched endografts in particular, surgeons will be able to offer endovascular therapy for the aortic arch and thoracoabdominal aorta to an increased population of patients when appropriate.

# **Step 1. Surgical Anatomy**

- ◆ Beginning distal to the left subclavian artery, the descending thoracic aorta is the continuation of the aortic arch. As it descends through the posterior mediastinum, the descending thoracic aorta lies to the left of the vertebral bodies and gradually approaches the midline. At the level of the 12th vertebra, it passes through the aortic hiatus in the diaphragm and becomes the abdominal aorta [\(Fig. 27.1](#page-2-0)).
- ◆ Anterior branches of the descending thoracic aorta include bronchial and esophageal arteries. These branches continue as the segmental arterial supply to their respective structures. Intercostal arteries are posterior branches along the length of the descending thoracic aorta and provide segmental arterial blood supply to the spinal cord.

## **Abstract**

- ◆ In most patients, a dominant anterior medullary artery, the artery of Adamkiewicz, arises between levels T7 and L1 and provides most of the blood supply to the anterior spinal artery, perfusing the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord. Anteriorly, the intercostal arteries continue along the inferior margins of the ribs and form collaterals with the internal thoracic arteries located at the anterior chest wall.
- ◆ There are no major arterial branches in the descending thoracic aorta, enabling the treatment of the entire descending thoracic aorta with TEVAR. The first major branch is the celiac artery, which arises in the abdominal aorta to supply the upper gastrointestinal tract. However, complete coverage of the entire descending thoracic aorta, including the left subclavian artery, is associated with an increased risk of stroke and spinal cord ischemia.

### **Step 2. Preoperative Considerations**

◆ Careful preoperative planning with appropriate imaging is essential for TEVAR. Preoperative assessment must address two important issues: anatomic requirements and vascular access. The gold standard is computed tomography (CT) angiography of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis, with distal arterial runoffs. Thin-slice helical CT scanning with 2-mm slices is ideal to create three-dimensional reconstructions of the aorta. In patients with contraindications to intravenous contrast, magnetic resonance angiography is an acceptable alternative.

## **1. Anatomic Requirements**

- ◆ Anatomic requirements center on the suitability of the proximal and distal landing zones. TEVAR involves the deployment of an intraluminal endoprosthesis resulting in the exclusion of the thoracic aneurysm. Therefore, the essential requirement is suitable proximal and distal landing zones to achieve an adequate seal and prevent endoleaks.
- ◆ The evaluation for the suitability of the landing zones involves two major criteria, the length of the zone and the aortic diameter. Although device-specific, the length of the landing zone must be sufficient to achieve adequate exclusion. For most devices, the requirement is 2 cm of aorta without significant tapering. The aortic diameter must safely accommodate a selfexpanding endovascular device. For aneurysmal disease, the device should be upsized (compared with the diameter of the landing zone) by 10% to 20% to achieve adequate exclusion. Current devices allow safe treatment for aortic diameters between 18 and 43 mm.
- ◆ For nonaneurysmal disease, such as dissection or traumatic transection, less aggressive upsizing (< 10%) is generally recommended.
- ◆ Additional factors to consider in the evaluation of the landing zones include the presence of thrombus, rapid tapering, calcification, tortuosity, and angulation ([Fig. 27.2](#page-4-0))
- ◆ Circumferential thrombus and extensive calcification at a landing zone may not allow adequate seal, resulting in endoleaks.
- ◆ Minimal tapering of the aortic diameter over the length of the landing zone (< 15%), with minimal tortuosity and angulation, are also desirable to ensure adequate exclusion.
- ◆ Angulation is often a proximal landing zone issue at the level of the distal arch. Severe angulation may result in so-called bird-beaking of the endograft. These and other factors may require extension of the proximal and distal landing zones. If coverage of the branch vessels is necessary at the proximal or distal landing zone, an extraanatomic bypass such as a carotid artery– subclavian artery bypass or mesenteric artery–visceral artery bypass, respectively, may be necessary. However, branched endografts that are currently undergoing feasibility trials may be appropriate in these settings in the future.

## **2. Vascular Access**

- ◆ A vascular complication is a major component of the morbidity and mortality rates associated with TEVAR. Current devices require a large-caliber delivery system, typically ranging from 18 to 24 F outer diameter. Several device manufacturers are investigating low-profile devices that would potentially decrease vascular complications.
- ◆ Preoperative imaging must include assessment of the iliofemoral vasculature. In addition to diameter, factors such as excessive calcification, tortuosity, history of peripheral vascular disease, and previous aortoiliac surgery may prevent safe delivery of the endograft.
- ◆ If severe peripheral occlusive disease is prohibitive to the safe delivery of the endograft, endovascular balloon angioplasty may be performed preoperatively or concomitantly during TEVAR before the introduction of the delivery devices.
- ◆ If femoral arterial access is inadequate, aortoiliac exposure through a retroperitoneal approach may be required. Other access alternatives include the subclavian artery, carotid artery, direct aortic approach, and transapical

## **3. Intraoperative Monitoring**

- ◆ Patients undergoing TEVAR are at risk for neurologic complications, including stroke and spinal cord ischemia. Intraoperative neuromonitoring using electroencephalography (EEG), motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), and somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEPs) should be routinely used for patients undergoing TEVAR. Stroke is associated with wire manipulation in the severely atherosclerotic aortic arch, and systemic heparinization should be attempted before any wire manipulation in the arch.
- ◆ Spinal cord ischemia may result in temporary or permanent lower extremity paraplegia. Factors such as the length of aortic coverage, previous abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, occlusive aortoiliac disease, and coverage of the left subclavian artery may affect the collateral arterial supply to the spinal cord and increase the risk of paraplegia.
- ◆ Intraoperative neuromonitoring may detect early evidence of spinal cord ischemia before a reliable neurologic examination can be performed. Maneuvers such as volume expansion and lumbar drainage should be used to prevent permanent paraplegia if intraoperative neuromonitoring suggests spinal cord ischemia.
- ◆ In patients with preoperative risk factors for spinal cord ischemia (i.e., previous abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, occlusive aortoiliac disease, or total coverage of the descending thoracic aorta), preemptive lumbar drainage should be considered.

# **Step 3. Operative Steps**

### **1. Imaging**

- ◆ The primary modality of intraoperative imaging for TEVAR is fluoroscopy. Using a fixed or portable C-arm, fluoroscopy provides real-time imaging. Additional helpful features include digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and road mapping.
- ◆ DSA allows subtraction and removal of background images such as bony structures to enhance visualization of the object injected with contrast (e.g., descending thoracic aorta).
- ◆ Road mapping involves the transfer of a reference image superimposed onto a live image for guidance during deployment of the device [\(Fig. 27.3A](#page-7-0)).
- ◆ Intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) is an option for patients with renal insufficiency or any other contraindication to intravenous contrast. Introduced from the femoral artery, IVUS provides the advantage of direct intraluminal imaging, particularly in cases of dissection, where the true and false lumens must be identified. Furthermore, intraoperative evaluation of the aorta, particularly the landing zones, can be performed.
- ◆ Information regarding the characteristics of the landing zones, such as diameter and the presence of thrombus, may be obtained and verified with preoperative imaging (see [Fig. 27.3B](#page-7-0)).

# **2. Access**

- ◆ For most patients, the common femoral artery provides adequate vascular access for deployment of the endograft [\(Fig. 27.4A and B](#page-9-0)). A transverse incision is made at the level of the inguinal ligament. The femoral artery is exposed, and proximal and distal control are obtained. An 18-G needle is used for direct puncture of the femoral artery, and a flexible guidewire (0.035-inch Bentson wire; Boston Scientific, Natick, MA) is introduced retrograde to the aortic arch using the Seldinger technique under fluoroscopy. Alternatively, percutaneous access of the femoral artery can be used with percutaneous closure devices, which are becoming increasingly popular among surgeons.
- ◆ Because of the angulation and tortuosity of the aortic arch, it is often difficult to deliver the endograft with a flexible guidewire, and an extra-stiff guidewire (0.035-inch Lunderquist wire; Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN) is often required. An extra-stiff guidewire should never be introduced into the arch without a guide catheter because of the risk of rupture or dissection. Therefore, a wire exchange maneuver is needed.
- ◆ Under fluoroscopy, a long guide catheter (100-cm MPA [multipurpose angle]; Cordis, Milpitas, CA) is advanced to the arch over the flexible guidewire. Once in position, the MPA is secured, and the flexible guidewire is removed. The Lunderquist wire is then advanced within the MPA to the level of the aortic arch under fluoroscopy. The MPA is removed and the extra-stiff guidewire is in position for deployment of the endograft.
- ◆ If the femoral artery is suboptimal for access, the iliac artery may be exposed with a retroperitoneal approach (see [Fig. 27.4C\)](#page-9-0). The iliac artery can be directly accessed using a technique similar to that described for the femoral artery. A double purse string of 4-0 polypropylene sutures is used to secure the vessel and provide hemostasis with the application of two sets of tourniquets. Alternatively, a 10-mm Dacron graft can be sewn to the iliac artery as a conduit for delivery of the endograft. The conduit may be brought through a separate counterincision in the groin to allow for better angulation of the relatively long and stiff deployment device.
- ◆ A diagnostic catheter (5 F pigtail; Cordis) with multiple side holes is placed percutaneously in the contralateral femoral artery. Standard percutaneous puncture with the Seldinger technique is used, and a 5 F or 7 F introducer sheath (Cordis) may be placed for access. The pigtail catheter is advanced to the aortic arch under fluoroscopy.
- ◆ Occasionally, brachial access is needed for coil embolization of the left subclavian artery to create an adequate proximal landing zone if a carotid artery–subclavian artery bypass was performed. Brachial access is also necessary for patients undergoing branched endograft deployment. This is because precise deployment of the endograft at the left subclavian artery or left common carotid artery can be facilitated with placement of the pigtail catheter through a left brachial artery access.
- ◆ Brachial access can often be achieved percutaneously using the Seldinger technique with placement of a 5 F introducer sheath. Systemic heparinization is recommended before any wire manipulation in the arch.

# **3. Deployment of Endograft for Aneurysmal Disease**

- ◆ Preoperative planning will have determined the number, size, and sequence of deployment of the endografts. The total treatment length (coverage length) of the descending thoracic aorta determines the length and number of endografts.
- ◆ The diameter of the endografts is determined by the diameter of the aortic landing zones. Although there are device-specific variabilities, the endografts are generally deployed in a proximal to distal sequence. However, if the proximal endograft is larger than the distal device, or precise deployment is required at the celiac artery, it may be preferable to deploy the endografts in a distal to proximal sequence.
- ◆ Under fluoroscopic guidance, the endograft is delivered to the proximal landing zone using a stiff guidewire [\(Figs. 27.5](#page-11-0) and [27.6\)](#page-11-1)
- ◆ Devices may come with an introducer sheath or can be deployed directly with access into the artery
- ◆ For optimal imaging of the arch and visualization of the brachiocephalic vessels, the C-arm is placed in a left anterior oblique position of 45 to 50 degrees. Once the endograft is in place, a diagnostic arteriogram is obtained to confirm the location of the aneurysm and position of the endograft in relation to the landing zone. If satisfactory, the pigtail catheter is withdrawn from behind the endograft, and the device is deployed. The mechanism of deployment is device specific, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Road mapping may be used to facilitate precise deployment of the endograft. To deploy a second endograft, it is exchanged with the first device over the Lunderquist guidewire [\(Fig. 27.7](#page-11-2)).
- ◆ If precise deployment at the celiac artery is necessary, the C-arm is placed in a full lateral position for optimal imaging, and a second diagnostic angiogram is obtained.
- ◆ Similar to the proximal device, the distal endograft is advanced to the appropriate landing zone with the use of angiography and road mapping. Once a satisfactory position has been achieved, the endograft is deployed. Adequate overlap of the devices is necessary to prevent junctional, or type III, endoleaks. Although overlaps are device specific, a minimum overlap of 5 cm is recommended.
- ◆ Ballooning of the landing zones and the junction between endografts is device specific, but it is generally recommended that optimal apposition of the endografts be achieved to prevent endoleaks. Under fluoroscopic guidance, a compliant balloon is advanced to the appropriate location and inflated. Overly aggressive ballooning may result in aortic dissection or stent fractures. In general, the ballooning is performed in a proximal to distal sequence, with final ballooning at the junctions.

**Figure 27.7**

- ◆ Once all ballooning has been completed, and the positions of the endografts are satisfactory, a completion angiography is performed [\(Fig. 27.8](#page-13-0)). The previously withdrawn diagnostic pigtail catheter is advanced into the aortic arch under fluoroscopic guidance.
- ◆ Completion angiography is performed to examine for endograft migration and endoleaks. If an endoleak is detected, treatment such as ballooning or placement of additional devices should be performed. If all is satisfactory, the delivery system is withdrawn from the access vessel. The Lunderquist guidewire is left in place in case of vascular injury or avulsion. By retaining wire access, an occlusive balloon can be advanced over the Lunderquist wire to achieve proximal control, if necessary. Once the surgeon is confident that there is no vascular injury, the Lunderquist guidewire is removed and the access vessel repaired. If there is concern over iliac rupture or dissection, a retrograde aortoiliac angiogram should be obtained.
- ◆ If a subclavian artery–carotid artery bypass was previously performed, coil embolization of the proximal left subclavian artery can be carried out.

# **4. Subclavian Revascularization**

- ◆ The proximal aorta and the aortic arch is divided into landing zones, as illustrated in [Fig.](#page-13-1)  [27.9.](#page-13-1) Landing zones Z0, Z1, and Z2 involve coverage of brachiocephalic vessels and require extraanatomic bypasses.
- ◆ Most commonly, Z2 deployment of the endograft is required to ensure a suitable proximal landing zone, necessitating a left subclavian transposition or a carotid artery–subclavian artery bypass before TEVAR.
- ◆ At our institution, bypass is preferred because transposition requires a more proximal exposure of the subclavian artery. In the setting of a thoracic aneurysm, the anatomy of the proximal left subclavian artery can be distorted. However, a left subclavian artery–carotid artery bypass requires a concomitant coil embolization of the proximal subclavian artery at the time of the thoracic endografting procedure to prevent the development of a type II endoleak. As described earlier, this can be accomplished through left brachial access at the time of TEVAR.
- ◆ The procedure is carried out through a supraclavicular approach to the left subclavian and common carotid arteries.
- ◆ An incision is made approximately 1 to 2 cm superior to the clavicle ([Fig. 27.10A\)](#page-13-2). Along with the sternocleidomastoid and omohyoid muscles, the platysma is divided with electrocautery. The anterior scalene muscle is identified, with the phrenic nerve coursing across the muscle fibers. Along with the phrenic nerve, the thoracic duct should be identified, and care should be taken to avoid injury to both structures. The subclavian artery can be found deep to the anterior scalene muscle. The vertebral and internal mammary arteries are identified.
- ◆ Proximal and distal dissection are performed; vessel loops may be used for vascular control (see [Fig. 27.10B](#page-13-2)). With medial retraction of the internal jugular vein, the common carotid artery is exposed. Vessel loops may also be used for vascular control and to optimize exposure of the common carotid artery. Systemic heparinization should be achieved before occlusion of the vessels.
- ◆ With the clamps in place, arteriotomies are performed in both the common carotid and left subclavian arteries (see [Fig. 27.10C\)](#page-13-2).
- ◆ It is important to construct the synthetic graft—expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) or Dacron—with the correct length and configuration to avoid tension or kinking. The anastomoses are performed using running 5-0 polypropylene sutures.
- ◆ Once completed, the clamps are removed after de-airing, and the anastomoses are examined for hemostasis. Once the surgeon is satisfied, the wound is closed in the appropriate anatomic layers.

## **5. Endograft Deployment in Aortic Dissection**

- ◆ Complicated acute type B aortic dissections (TBAD) can be managed with thoracic endografts. The goal in these patients is to cover the primary tear site to prevent further malperfusion and reexpansion of the true lumen [\(Fig. 27.11](#page-15-0)). Further use of bare metal stents may be necessary if malperfusion persists after coverage of the primary tear site ([Fig. 27.12](#page-15-1)). This can occur because of multiple fenestrations and reentry sites throughout the thoracoabdominal aorta. Coverage of the left subclavian artery may be necessary in many patients because the primary tear site typically occurs close to the origin of the left subclavian artery [\(Fig. 27.13](#page-15-2)). Open surgical repair in these patients carries significant morbidity and mortality.
- ◆ Chronic TBAD, which can be operated on for aneurysmal expansion, can be approached with open and endovascular repair. Endovascular repair in chronic type B patients can be challenging; it is important to identify anatomic characteristics on a CT scan that would lead patients to a successful repair with aortic remodeling.
- ◆ The use of IVUS is critical in patients with aortic dissection to identify and confirm the true lumen. IVUS may also help identify mesenteric branches that may be involved in the dissection ([Fig. 27.14](#page-15-3)).

## **6. Hybrid Arch Repair and Branched Endografts**

- ◆ Surgical management of aortic arch aneurysms remains a challenge, requiring deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) and a cerebral perfusion strategy. The success of an endovascular technique in the management of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms has led to the development of hybrid procedures for aortic arch aneurysm repair. The hybrid total arch repair involves open brachiocephalic bypass (debranching procedure) with concomitant endovascular arch stent grafting. In contrast to traditional open total arch repair, these hybrid procedures have the advantages of avoiding DHCA and possible cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
- ◆ Midterm outcomes for these procedures have been encouraging.
- ◆ Hybrid arch repairs can be performed as concomitant or staged procedures. The patient is placed in a supine position, and a partial upper sternotomy or full sternotomy may be used for adequate exposure of the arch. Neuromonitoring with continuous EEG is used for the detection of neurologic events throughout the operation, as per our standard arch protocol.
- ◆ Based on exposure and the size of the arch aneurysms, CPB and aortic occlusion may be necessary to perform the proximal anastomosis of the brachiocephalic bypass.
- ◆ The goal is to create an adequate proximal landing zone in the ascending aorta for the concomitant arch stent graft deployment. This often requires the proximal anastomosis of the brachiocephalic bypass to be performed at the level of the sinotubular junction.
- ◆ Because of the limited length of the ascending aorta, the aortic and cardioplegia cannulae are placed in full recognition of the location of both the proximal anastomosis of the brachiocephalic bypass and proximal landing zone of the arch stent graft. If adequate aortic length is present, a side-biting clamp can be placed at the level of the ascending aorta during the proximal anastomosis, and CPB may be avoided. A modified trifurcated Dacron graft with an additional fourth branch for stent graft deployment (Vascutek-Terumo, Ann Arbor, MI) is used for the brachiocephalic bypass to the great vessels.

<span id="page-15-0"></span>![](_page_15_Picture_3.jpeg)

<span id="page-15-3"></span><span id="page-15-1"></span>![](_page_15_Picture_5.jpeg)

- ◆ The proximal anastomosis to the ascending aorta is performed as proximally as possible, just distal to the sinotubular junction, to allow deployment of the stent graft in the ascending aorta without compromise to the proximal inflow anastomosis. (The average length of the ascending aorta from the sinotubular junction to the innominate artery is 6 to 7 cm, thus allowing an optimal 3 to 4 cm proximal landing zone.) The proximal reconstruction of the brachiocephalic bypass can be performed as an aortic patch or interposition graft. Once the anastomosis is completed, the distal end-to-end anastomoses of the trifurcated grafts to the arch vessels are performed from left to right with sequential clamping—first the left subclavian, then the left common carotid, and finally the innominate artery anastomoses are performed. The proximal takeoff of each arch vessel is detached.
- ◆ Deployment of the stent graft is achieved antegrade through the fourth arm of the modified trifurcated graft or retrograde through the femoral artery. The technical aspects of deployment of the device are similar to those for TEVAR in the descending thoracic aorta, as described in the previous section. Fluoroscopic guidance is required for precise deployment of the aortic stent graft. We have proposed a classification of hybrid arch repairs in the past whereby brachiocephalic revascularization is followed by endograft deployment in an antegrade or retrograde fashion ([Fig. 27.15](#page-17-0)).

<span id="page-17-0"></span>![](_page_17_Picture_2.jpeg)

◆ Feasibility studies for branched endografts began enrolling in the recent past, and the early results appear to be promising. The advantage of such a procedure is to minimize open surgery, particularly left subclavian revascularization. This allows the surgeon to deploy the endograft in zone 2 with left subclavian patency. Alternatively, following left subclavian revascularization, the endograft can be deployed in zone 1 with the branched graft perfusing the left carotid artery [\(Fig. 27.16\)](#page-19-0).

## **Step 4. Postoperative Care**

- ◆ Postoperative care of the patient undergoing TEVAR involves the standard resuscitation protocol used with any major cardiovascular operation.
- ◆ Hemodynamic monitoring is recommended in an intensive care unit setting. Because of the lack of an aortic suture line, higher blood pressure may be tolerated postoperatively to optimize spinal cord perfusion.
- ◆ Patients should also be allowed to emerge from anesthesia expeditiously for early neurologic assessment. If spinal cord ischemia is suspected, immediate salvage maneuvers, including spinal drainage, hypertension, and volume expansion, should be used.

## **Step 5. Pearls and Pitfalls**

- ◆ Success with TEVAR requires extensive preoperative planning, with regard not only to device selection, but to comprehensive evaluation of vascular access–related issues. Size, tortuosity, and calcification of the iliofemoral vasculature must be carefully examined.
- ◆ In the event of iliofemoral injury [\(Fig. 27.17A\)](#page-19-1), the surgeon must be able to address this potentially lethal complication expeditiously. The importance of maintaining wire access until the integrity of the iliofemoral vasculature is ensured cannot be overemphasized.
- ◆ Device selection as well as the technical considerations of deployment must be carefully planned. Thorough evaluation of the proximal landing zone is required to prevent bird-beaking of the device (see [Fig. 27.17B\)](#page-19-1).

<span id="page-19-1"></span><span id="page-19-0"></span>![](_page_19_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Figure 27.17**

- ◆ Also, incorrect sizing of the device can have catastrophic consequences. For aneurysms, the recommendation is upsizing 10% to 20% based on the true diameter on cross-sectional examination of the aorta. Downsizing may result in inadequate exclusion, predisposing the patient to endograft migration or endoleak (see [Fig. 27.17C](#page-19-1)). Aggressive upsizing should also be discouraged because device collapse is a potential complication ([Fig. 27.18\)](#page-21-0). Another possible complication is aortic dissection ([Fig. 27.19](#page-21-1)). Aggressive ballooning may result in the development of aortic dissection and should also be avoided.
- ◆ Finally, if multiple devices are deployed, it is crucial to allow adequate overlap to prevent the development of junctional, or type III, endoleaks [\(Fig. 27.20](#page-21-2)).
