# Surgery for Left Ventricular Aneurysm and Remodeling

Ravi K. Ghanta and Irving L. Kron

- ◆ Amelioration of left ventricular (LV) remodeling is an appealing target for medical and surgical therapies for heart failure. Remodeling is a complex process that leads to maladaptive ventricular dilation, hypertrophy, and altered ventricular wall stress and may occur after large myocardial infarction, chronic ischemia, or chronic valvular heart disease.
- ◆ The most distinct sequela of remodeling is aneurysm formation at the site of infarction. Transmural infarcts result in full-thickness necrosis and scar formation, with subsequent thinning and infarct expansion secondary to mechanical stretch. Nontransmural infarcts alter regional compliance resulting in infarct area bulging and expansion. The net result is formation of a ventricular aneurysm and increased LV volume.
- ◆ Consequently, surgical ventricular reconstruction (SVR) primarily involves aneurysmectomy and LV volume reduction. These operations are almost always done concomitantly with coronary artery bypass grafting or mitral valve surgery.

## **Step 1. Surgical Anatomy**

- ◆ LV aneurysms occur at the site of infarction, most frequently anterior apical (90%) after left anterior descending (LAD) and posterior (10%) after circumflex (Cx) infarcts.
- ◆ Important anatomic considerations are the location of major coronary arteries, such as the LAD and Cx relative to the proposed ventriculotomy ([Fig. 30.1;](#page-2-0) *arrow* indicates LAD).

### **Step 2. Preoperative Considerations**

- ◆ Indications for operation include:
  - ◆ congestive heart failure
  - ◆ angina
  - ◆ aneurysm expansion and rupture
  - ◆ arrhythmia
  - ◆ embolism

### **Abstract**

Left ventricular (LV) aneurysms most frequently occur as a consequence of maladaptive remodeling after a large infarction. Surgical ventricular restoration involves aneurysmectomy and LV volume reduction. Patient selection, appropriate placement of the endoventricular circular Fontan suture, and concomitant revascularization or valve repair is essential for success.

- ◆ Preoperative left heart catheterization is mandatory. Complete revascularization should be performed to viable myocardial territories. An LV aneurysm can be well delineated on the ventriculogram during catheterization, as demonstrated in [Fig. 30.2](#page-4-0) (highlighted by *red arrows*).
- ◆ The size of the ventricle and location of the akinetic or dyskinetic portion are critical and require additional diagnostic imaging, such as via echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There are no established size criteria for SVR; however, SVR can be considered when the LV end-systolic volume index is more than 80 mL/m2 or the end-diastolic volume index is more than 120 mL/m2 .
- ◆ The degree of mitral regurgitation should be quantified before surgery by echocardiography. Mitral valve annuloplasty and/or replacement should be performed if severe. [Fig. 30.3](#page-4-1) shows an apical aneurysm in the four-chamber view.
- ◆ Cardiac MRI can measure aneurysm size, ventricular morphology, and myocardial viability. Cardiac MRI can aid in planning revascularization strategy and extent of the scar. [Fig. 30.4](#page-4-2) is an MRI scan of an apical infarction. Note the thinning of the anterior wall and apex (*red arrows*), delineating the extent of the aneurysm.
- ◆ If ventricular arrhythmia is an issue, preoperative endocardial mapping is useful for possible concomitant ablation during SVR.

#### **Step 3. Operative Steps**

- ◆ A median sternotomy and central cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass are performed. If mitral valve surgery is planned, bicaval cannulation is performed. Cardiopulmonary bypass is initiated. To prevent potential embolization from a small LV thrombus, care is taken to prevent manipulation of the heart.
- ◆ The akinetic or dyskinetic segment of the left ventricle can be identified intraoperatively by the characteristic dimpling or flattening of the anterior wall after the aortic cross-clamp is applied and the LV vent is on [\(Fig. 30.5](#page-6-0)).
- ◆ Aortic cross-clamp is applied, and cardiac arrest is achieved with antegrade and possibly retrograde cardioplegia.
- ◆ Complete coronary revascularization, including the LAD, is performed.
- ◆ The heart is elevated in the pericardial well to allow for visualization. The ventricle is opened ([Fig. 30.6\)](#page-6-1) with an incision (*dashed line*) approximately 1 to 2 cm lateral to the LAD and in a direction parallel to the LAD (*arrow*). This places the incision parallel to the septum. The myocardial thinning and endocardial scar should be visible through the ventriculotomy.

- ◆ After stay sutures are placed, the intraventricular cavity is cleared of thrombus, and the anatomy is identified. The scarred region has a white coloration [\(Fig. 30.7](#page-8-0); *yellow arrow*). The papillary muscles are located (*blue arrow*).
- ◆ Multiple techniques are used to determine the location of the endoventricular circular suture, also known as the Fontan suture. Some surgeons have suggested placement of an intraventricular balloon (expanded to 50 mL/m2 ) to guide the placement of the Fontan suture and subsequent reduction of the LV cavity, as demonstrated in [Fig. 30.8](#page-8-1). With the intraventricular balloon in situ, placement of the Fontan suture allows for the ventricular volume to be reduced, primarily in the anterior and septal regions of the left ventricle.
- ◆ We use preoperative transesophageal echocardiography to determine heart size and Fontan suture placement relative to the ventricular walls and papillary muscles of the mitral valve, aiming for a postoperative end-diastolic ventricular volume of approximately 50 mL/m2 . An alternative technique involves identifying the transition zone between viable myocardium and scar tissue by grasping the ventricular wall between the thumb and forefinger and identifying where the transition point occurs, indicated by the thinning of the ventricle between the finger and thumb.

◆ A 2-0 polypropylene monofilament suture is passed through the endocardium at the transition between the scarred and normal myocardium in a circular fashion (Fontan stitch). Care is taken not to include the papillary muscles in this circular suture [\(Figs. 30.9](#page-10-0) and [30.10](#page-10-1)).

- ◆ In cinching the Fontan suture [\(Fig. 30.11](#page-12-0)), care is taken to tighten the suture to define the new wall, not to close the opening. This reduces the ventricular cavity volume.
- ◆ A Dacron patch is then fashioned to close the opening; care is taken to make the patch large enough that it can be readily sutured over the defect. If the residual opening is less than 1 cm wide, the defect may be closed primarily with a second suture line of 2-0 or running 3-0 polypropylene monofilament sutures ([Fig. 30.12\)](#page-12-1).

**Figure 30.12**

- ◆ The patch is sutured into place with running 3-0 polypropylene monofilament sutures ([Fig. 30.13](#page-14-0)).
- ◆ Once the patch is placed, the ventriculotomy is closed in a two-layer fashion, using first a horizontal mattress suture and then a running over and over–type closure [\(Fig. 30.14](#page-14-1)).
- ◆ Note that some surgeons prefer to reinforce the ventriculotomy closure with Teflon strips, as demonstrated; however, this may conceal the sources of any residual hemorrhage ([Fig. 30.15\)](#page-14-2).
- ◆ If severe mitral regurgitation is present, the mitral valve must be repaired. Usually, the mitral leaflet morphology is normal, and the mechanism of regurgitation is secondary to papillary muscle displacement or annular enlargement from a dilated ventricle. These mechanisms are addressed by placement of an annuloplasty ring. The repair is performed through a standard left atrial incision. Interrupted braided 2-0 sutures are placed in a horizontal mattress fashion around the annulus, and the annuloplasty ring is seated to these.
- ◆ Inferior aneurysms are treated using the same principles. However, the defect is often smaller, and the neck can be closed primarily.

# **Step 4. Postoperative Care**

- ◆ Patients may require intraaortic balloon counterpulsation in the initial postoperative period, especially if there is an element of right ventricular dysfunction or a poor preoperative LV ejection fraction (< 25%).
- ◆ Postoperative care is focused on managing heart failure. We use Swan-Ganz catheters in all these cases.

#### **Step 5. Pearls and Pitfalls**

- ◆ Incomplete revascularization, especially of the septum, prevents optimal contractility and recovery of function.
- ◆ Embolism from a ventricular thrombus secondary to ventricular manipulation before the aortic cross-clamp can be placed.
- ◆ Lack of regional basal contraction of the left ventricle portends a poor outcome and should be considered a relative contraindication.
- ◆ The residual ventricular cavity may be too small, resulting in inadequate stroke volume and cardiac output.
- ◆ Severe right ventricular dysfunction is a relative contraindication to the procedure.
- ◆ Significant residual mitral regurgitation portends a poor outcome.
- ◆ Areas of ventricular calcification must be removed.
- ◆ The ejection fraction should be evaluated at 3 months and the need for an automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillator assessed, based on recognized guidelines.
- ◆ The use of carbon dioxide should be considered to decrease the amount of air introduced into the ventricular cavity and decrease residual air bubbles after the cross-clamp is removed.
