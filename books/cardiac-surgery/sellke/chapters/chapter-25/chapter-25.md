# Aortic Arch Aneurysms

Walter F. DeNino and John S. Ikonomidis

# **Step 1. Surgical Anatomy**

- ◆ Academic anatomists refer to the aortic arch as that part of the aorta that begins and ends with a line drawn in cross section across the aorta at a level corresponding to the lesser curve of the aortic arch. This therefore implies that the arch of the aorta starts at approximately the level of the superior reflection of the pericardial sac. However, surgical anatomists and surgeons tend to consider the aortic arch as that portion of the aorta that begins with a line drawn in cross section across the aorta at the level of the proximal origin of the ostium of the innominate artery and ending at the distal margin of the ostium of the left subclavian artery.
- ◆ The aortic arch tapers somewhat from anterior to posterior owing to the takeoff of the three large arterial branches—innominate artery, left common carotid artery, and left subclavian artery. In approximately 5% of patients, this anatomic configuration consists of a double ostium or so-called bovine aortic arch, where the innominate artery and left common carotid artery arise from a somewhat larger, but single, aortic ostium [\(Fig. 25.1](#page-2-0)).
- ◆ Other anatomic structures of importance during aortic arch surgery include the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, left phrenic nerve, and right recurrent laryngeal nerve. These become important when considering separate replacement of the branch vessels in conjunction with aortic arch surgery.
- ◆ Aortic arch aneurysms seldom occur as isolated structures, but rather occur in conjunction with aneurysmal dilation of the proximal ascending aorta or distal aorta. Aneurysmal dilation often causes the aortic arch aneurysm to shift anteriorly and laterally to the right. Because most cases of aortic arch aneurysm surgery are performed through a median sternotomy, this anatomic change brings critical structures more anteriorly and may facilitate the repair ([Fig. 25.2\)](#page-2-1).

#### **Step 2. Preoperative Considerations**

- ◆ Assessment of the patient's fitness for aortic arch replacement has multiple facets. Most importantly, the patient needs to be of an age and physical condition that would withstand a major operation such as this. A careful consideration of noncardiovascular comorbidities such as respiratory and renal disease should be undertaken because these are significant independent predictors of poor outcome.
- ◆ From a cardiovascular point of view, left ventricular function and the presence or absence of significant valvular disease are important variables to consider. The presence of coronary disease does not preclude operation, but it would mandate additional coronary artery bypass procedures that would add to the length of the surgical procedure.
- ◆ The presence of significant peripheral vascular disease in the carotid arteries, subclavian arteries, or femoral arteries is an important consideration in terms of determining cannulation and perfusion strategies during circulatory arrest. Similar anatomic considerations apply to the configuration of the aortic arch anatomy as far as the great vessels are concerned. A history of previous stroke or transient ischemic attacks may indicate the presence of significant cerebrovascular disease, and this must be investigated thoroughly with thin-slice computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or cerebral angiography. A recommended standard preoperative workup for patients undergoing aortic arch replacement is shown in [Box 25.1.](#page-3-0)

#### **Step 3. Operative Steps**

## **1. Pharmacologic Adjuncts**

◆ An important consideration with aortic arch replacement is cerebral preservation. Circulatory arrest in some form is required for aortic arch replacement, so a strategy should be undertaken to minimize the period and extent of cerebral hypoperfusion.

# **2. Cannulation Site and Adjunct Perfusion Strategy**

- ◆ Selection of cannulation site is important. In general, for circulatory arrest times anticipated to be less than 30 minutes, current literature suggests that direct cannulation of the aneurysm distally, cooling the patient down to 18°to 20°C (64.4°–68°F), and discontinuation of the pump with no perfusion adjuncts for 10 to 15 minutes is safe.
- ◆ If it is anticipated that a longer time on circulatory arrest will be required, such as for full arch replacement, a strategy should be used to maintain some form of cerebral perfusion at this temperature. This strategy should provide the best cerebral perfusion while minimizing the clutter in the operative field. Among the currently available techniques of retrograde cerebral perfusion, direct perfusion of the great vessels with separate cannulae, and selective perfusion through the right axillary or innominate artery, we recommend selective antegrade cerebral perfusion, especially if the patient has a bovine aortic arch. We believe that this is the best strategy because of the following:
  - 1. The vast majority of patients have an intact circle of Willis, and therefore selective antegrade cerebral perfusion is usually appropriate for most cases of arch replacement;
  - 2. Retrograde cerebral perfusion has been associated with the development of brain edema and perhaps some neurologic dysfunction, and detailed studies have indicated that very little blood flow given this way actually reaches the cerebral cortex;
  - 3. Insertion of antegrade catheters into the ostia of the arch vessels is cumbersome, complicates the operative field, and may dislodge plaques if the arch is involved with atherosclerosis, possibly contributing to postoperative neurologic sequelae.
- ◆ The arterial side of the pump should be split to provide perfusion for this cannula and to enable a separate cannula to be inserted into the aortic arch graft.

## **3. Arterial Cannulation**

Right Axillary Artery

- ◆ The right axillary artery is accessed through a right infraclavicular incision approximately 2 to 3 cm below the clavicle, inferiorly along the lateral aspect of the clavicle, just before the deltopectoral groove [\(Fig. 25.3\)](#page-5-0). This incision is approximately 5 to 7 cm long, depending on the patient's habitus, through which a portion of the pectoralis major and usually most, if not all, of the pectoralis minor is divided. The axillary artery sits in the brachial plexus and is easily palpable. Electrocautery is not advised during this portion of the dissection to expose the axillary artery because of the risk of thermal injury to the brachial plexus. It is usually straightforward to identify and encircles the axillary artery over a distance of 3 to 4 cm.
- ◆ Cannulation strategies for the axillary artery can include direct cannulation or placement of a side graft. We prefer a 10-mm Dacron side graft because this maintains perfusion to the right arm. There also is evidence in the literature that a side graft strategy for cannulation of the axillary artery may be more beneficial in reducing neurologic injury than direct cannulation. In addition, because the axillary artery is such a friable vessel, once the graft is anastomosed, it is not necessary to repair this artery when the cannula is removed. Instead, the graft can be tied off at the end of the procedure with maintenance of excellent arterial patency.
- ◆ The patient must be heparinized to avoid clotting of the graft during sternotomy and preparation for bypass. Also, a right radial artery arterial catheter should be placed beforehand to monitor arterial pressure during the circulatory arrest period.

## Innominate Artery

◆ If the innominate artery is selected, as is our current preference, the sternotomy incision is extended cephalad approximately 3 cm above the sternal notch, and soft tissue is divided in the midline. The innominate vein is retracted caudad with a vessel loop. The innominate artery is circumferentially dissected and controlled proximally and distally. Heparin is administered, a partial occlusion clamp is placed, and a 10-mm arteriotomy is made with a no. 11 blade scalpel. A 10-mm graft is then anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion without bevel using 5-0 Prolene sutures [\(Fig. 25.4\)](#page-7-0). The partial occlusion clamp is removed. The graft is de-aired and then connected to the arterial limb of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit.

# **4. Establishment of Cardiopulmonary Bypass and Systemic Cooling**

- ◆ Extensive dissection is undertaken around the aneurysm, extending as far into the arch as is thought comfortable before the institution of cardiopulmonary bypass. Double-stage venous cannulation is performed, an antegrade cardioplegia cannula is placed in the aneurysm, and a coronary sinus catheter is placed in preparation for cardioplegia administration ([Fig. 25.5](#page-7-1)).
- ◆ After systemic heparinization and confirmation of an activated clotting time of 400 seconds, cardiopulmonary bypass is instituted. Systemic cooling with an alpha-stat acid-base management strategy is immediately begun, and systemic temperature is monitored by nasopharyngeal and bladder probes. As much of the aortic arch dissection is completed as possible to eliminate its necessity during the circulatory arrest period. It is usually possible to mobilize the arch aneurysm to the level of the left subclavian artery, bearing in mind that this is the region of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, which should be identified and preserved if feasible. The innominate vein should be widely mobilized for easy cephalad or caudad retraction.
- ◆ Ventricular fibrillation usually occurs at a blood temperature around 26°to 28°C (78.8°–82.4°F), but this can be prevented to some extent with a 100- to 200-mg intravenous bolus of lidocaine. If the heart fibrillates, care must be taken to ensure that the left ventricle does not distend. If this happens, the options include cross-clamping and cardioplegic arrest or insertion of a left ventricular vent through the right superior pulmonary vein or left ventricular apex (our preference). To arrest the heart, the cross-clamp is applied across the aneurysm with the pump flows decreased to minimize tension on the dilated aortic wall. Pump flows are then brought back up, and the heart is arrested with cold blood cardioplegia, first given antegrade to bring about a satisfactory cardiac arrest and then switching to retrograde coronary sinus administration. The heart is further protected with a myocardial cooling jacket, and we usually place a cold laparotomy sponge on the right ventricle to preserve the right ventricle further. Cardioplegic infusions of 250 to 500 mL are given every 20 minutes throughout the surgical procedure. We use a myocardial temperature probe placed in the interventricular septum under the left anterior descending coronary artery to maintain the myocardial temperature between 10° and 15°C (50°–59°F) throughout the operation.
- ◆ For patients in whom proximal ascending and aortic root operations are necessary, this cooling period is the time to resect the ascending aneurysm or perform as much of the root replacement as possible. However, once desired cooling is achieved, the proximal operation should not continue but should be deferred for reconstruction of the aortic arch. This avoids unnecessary time on cardiopulmonary bypass; in addition, sufficient time will be available to complete the operation as rewarming is performed after the arch replacement is completed.

## **5. Circulatory Arrest and Preparation for Aortic Arch Replacement**

- ◆ When the bladder temperature reaches 18°to 20°C (64.4°–68°F), the pump is discontinued but the patient is not exsanguinated. A small clamp is placed on the innominate artery proximally, and flow is initiated to maintain a normal arterial infusion pressure (mean radial artery pressure ≈ 60 mm Hg). The main cross-clamp is removed, and blood is cleared from the field with cardiotomy bypass suction.
- ◆ Once selective antegrade cerebral perfusion is begun, back-bleeding from the remainder of the great vessel ostia sometimes necessitates placement of small clamps across these vessels. Once this is achieved, dissection is undertaken, whereby the arch vessels are prepared for implantation, and a distal anastomotic site is prepared ([Fig. 25.6\)](#page-9-0). In the patient with no connective tissue disorder and good tissue in the aortic arch, it is appropriate to replace the aortic arch with the great vessels as a single Carrel patch. However, in patients with known connective tissue disease, the aortic arch should be completely replaced, excluding all aortic tissue to prevent late aneurysm formation at the island site. For this procedure, special branched grafts are available for separate implantation of the great vessels.

#### **6. Aortic Arch Replacement**

- ◆ Once the distal anastomotic site in the descending thoracic aorta is prepared, a four-branch graft is brought into the field and invaginated into itself. This is inserted into the distal descending thoracic aorta, and an anastomosis is performed between the aorta and the cuff, usually with 3-0 polypropylene sutures ([Fig. 25.7A\)](#page-11-0). We do not use felt material for this anastomosis.
- ◆ Once the anastomosis is completed, the inside of the graft is evaginated, and a small amount of surgical adhesive is laid down around the anastomotic site to seal any needle holes. The side branch of the graft is then cannulated and perfusion to the body is resumed, during which time the graft is de-aired; a cross-clamp is then placed just proximal to the branch to allow distal cold perfusion (see [Fig. 25.7B](#page-11-0)).
- ◆ Anastomoses then proceed with the left subclavian, left common carotid, and innominate arteries, with sequential moving of the clamp proximally with completion of each anastomosis to maximize cerebral flow. After completion of all the anastomoses, the clamp is then moved proximal to the innominate artery graft, thus restoring complete perfusion to the head (see [Fig. 25.7C\)](#page-11-0). At this point, the pump flow is increased as appropriate, and rewarming is begun.

#### **7. Closure**

- ◆ During the rewarming procedure, the ascending aorta-to-graft anastomosis is performed, or proximal aortic work or valve replacement or root replacement can be completed, after which a graft-to-graft anastomosis is performed. An ascending aortic vent is inserted and, after appropriate de-airing maneuvers, the cross-clamp is removed and myocardial perfusion is begun ([Fig. 25.8\)](#page-13-0). Atrial and ventricular pacemaker wires are inserted, the heart is allowed to recover on cardiopulmonary bypass, and ventilation is begun, with continued de-airing. All suture lines are inspected for bleeding that requires surgical repair, and the axillary artery graft is tied off and divided.
- ◆ When the bladder temperature has reached at least 36.5°C (97.7°F), de-airing has been completed, normal sinus rhythm is restored, and blood gas and laboratory values have normalized, the patient is weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass. The venous cannula is removed, and protamine is administered through the inflow limb of the arch graft, after which the limb is ligated and divided close to the arch graft ([Fig. 25.9\)](#page-13-1). The innominate graft is ligated with two no. 2 heavy silk sutures and cut three corrugations above the ties.
- ◆ After confirmation of complete hemostasis, drains are inserted, usually a flexible drain posteriorly and one anterior chest tube. The sternum is closed with stainless steel wires, followed by apposition of soft tissues in layers with absorbable sutures.

## **Step 4. Postoperative Care**

- ◆ Patients who undergo aortic arch replacement are critically ill. Important postoperative considerations are maintenance of appropriate hemodynamics and urine output and careful monitoring for bleeding. Hypertension swings are not uncommon in these patients, and a single hypertension swing may trigger bleeding from one of the many suture lines used in this operation.
- ◆ Careful vigilance regarding the patient's filling pressures is mandatory to identify any problems with cardiac tamponade from bleeding. The clinical examination of the patient going into tamponade shows cold and mottled extremities and an abrupt decline in urine output. Early reexploration in these patients is mandatory and lifesaving. After an appropriate period of stability, the patient is weaned from the anesthetic and is allowed to awaken. Extubation then proceeds by standard criteria, predicated on the patient's appropriate neurologic recovery.

## **Step 5. Pearls and Pitfalls**

- ◆ It is important, especially when a branch replacement of the arch is used, to identify and preserve the recurrent laryngeal nerves. There is a possibility with this operation that both nerves can be destroyed, which is irreparably debilitating for the patient.
- ◆ Orientation of the branch graft is important. When the graft is invaginated, it is advisable to mark the graft cuff with a marking pencil on the side where the branches will be oriented to allow appropriate orientation of the cuff in the descending thoracic aorta. This is performed under circulatory arrest; having to revise this anastomosis because of improper orientation can have dire consequences.
- ◆ Another important consideration is suture technique. The vessels being sewn are usually histologically abnormal (especially if involved with connective tissue disease), and great care must be taken with each pass of the needle to avoid microtears, which could translate into troublesome bleeding problems later.
- ◆ Bleeding can seem unstoppable at times with this operation. The best way to deal with this is first, to ensure visually that there are no sites of bleeding that require direct surgical repair while on bypass. Second, make sure that the patient is completely rewarmed (i.e., at least 36.5°C [97.7°F] bladder temperature) before weaning from bypass. Third, reverse anticoagulation with protamine given slowly, pack all surgical sites, and wait 5 minutes. Have platelets and fresh-frozen plasma hanging and dripping in during this time. After this period, most needle holes will seal, and the bleeding will cease or decrease to the point at which sites that need further attention can be easily identified. From here, if the patient remains coagulopathic, keep the patient as warm as possible and correct all coagulation abnormalities with blood products and extra protamine. If bleeding is still troublesome, consider administration of activated recombinant factor VIIa concentrate.
