# **Step 1. Surgical Anatomy and Exposure**

- ◆ The potential donor is placed supine on the operating room table. The standard incision for the multiorgan donor is a midline sternotomy incision extended into a midline abdominal incision to expose the liver, kidneys, small bowel, and pancreas [\(Fig. 33.1](#page-2-0)).
- ◆ The superior vena cava (SVC) lies partly outside the pericardium. It is anterior and to the right of the trachea and its surrounding nodal tissue. The arch of the azygos vein is noted posteriorly as the only branch of the SVC. This is an important landmark because the SVC should be harvested beyond the insertion of the azygos vein and, if possible, to the origin of the innominate vein.
- ◆ Nine vessels are exposed during retrieval—the two cavae, four pulmonary veins, the aorta, and the right and left pulmonary arteries. If the heart is retrieved as the sole thoracic organ, the pulmonary veins are divided, and the pulmonary artery is divided at the level of the bifurcation. The inferior vena cava (IVC) is usually left with the hepatic resection because the inferior anastomosis is donor right atrium to recipient IVC.
- ◆ If the lungs are being simultaneously harvested with the heart, the transverse pericardial sinus is explored in situ. The lung team usually cannulates the distal pulmonary artery at the level of the bifurcation to facilitate organ flushing and the administration of preservative solution. The left atrium is divided halfway between the coronary sinus and the insertion of the pulmonary veins.

### **Abstract**

As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first human heart transplant in December 1967, we marvel at the tremendous medical advances that have taken place. Surprisingly few modifications have occurred since the original surgical technique was described by Shumway and Lower. The following chapter describes the surgical conduct of both the donor procurement and recipient implant for modern cardiac transplantation.

#### **Step 2. Preoperative Considerations**

#### **1. Selection and Management**

- ◆ Risk matching between donor characteristics and recipient needs ensures maximal utilization of the potential donor pool and minimizes the risks associated with longer waiting lists.[1-3](#page-26-0) For example, a heart from a higher risk donor may be used in an older recipient with previous surgery, but not in a younger recipient who is a good candidate for an assist device. The typical risk factors for donor hearts include advanced age, prolonged ischemic time, preexisting ventricular dysfunction and/or coronary disease, and the need for inotropic support.[4](#page-26-1) Furthermore, it is unwise to compound risk (e.g., use an older donor subjected to a prolonged ischemic time).
- ◆ Common causes of brain death include trauma and intracranial bleeding. Suicide remains a common cause, with the mode of death incorporating both anoxic and traumatic brain injuries. Opioid intoxication is an increasingly frequent cause of donor death. Cardiac donations after circulatory arrest have been recently reported and are likely to increase in the future.[5](#page-26-2)
- ◆ Screening for a given recipient begins with confirming blood type compatibility and the approximate size, height, and weight for the patient, as well as gender. Ensuring an appropriatesized donor (> 0.8 of the recipient's size) remains a key component in the selection of donor-recipient matches. The size match guideline may be adjusted if the donor is female and the recipient is male (closer height to weight match). It may be widened if the donor is a younger male or if there is a shorter anticipated ischemia time. Recipient pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) must also be taken into account, and a larger older donor is usually preferred. Some surgeons contend that an 80-kg male donor is adequate for any size of recipient.[2](#page-26-3)
- ◆ The female donor older than 35 years with an intracranial bleed must be evaluated carefully. This cause of death is frequently associated with hypertensive disease and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). LVH as assessed by echocardiographic measurement of septal and posterior wall thickness and electrocardiographic criteria should be judged in the context of the patient's body surface area. The use of hypertrophied hearts can significantly affect graft survival, particularly in the presence of electrocardiographic criteria that reflect a long-standing history.[6](#page-26-4) However, LVH can be overestimated in donors who are hypovolemic.
- ◆ The ideal donor should have excellent cardiac function with appropriate filling pressure and normal anatomy. He or she should not require any inotropic support; however, pressor support to overcome low systemic vascular resistance is usually acceptable. Many centers will accept a heart with a low filling pressure (<10 mm Hg) and no inotropic support, even in the absence of echocardiographic assessment.
- ◆ As donor age increases, the depth of evaluation increases as well. Cardiac catheterization is recommended in all males older than 45 or females older than 50 years.[3](#page-26-5) Donors with known risk factors for coronary disease should also undergo angiography. These risk factors include diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking history, and a history of cocaine abuse.
- ◆ The presence of any coronary artery disease is usually a contraindication to utilization for a standard donor. However, in extenuating circumstances for a recipient at high risk for imminent death, simultaneous coronary bypass surgery can be performed.
- ◆ Hepatitis C has traditionally been a contraindication to heart donation because it may predispose the recipient to liver dysfunction and coronary graft disease. However, newer antivirals are now permitting the successful use of hepatitis C positive donors.[7](#page-26-6) Similarly, hepatitis B core antibody immunoglobulin G (IgG)–positive donors may be used for high-status recipients if immunoglobulin M (IgM) is negative. In such cases, the risk of transmission is considered low (< 5%–10%).

#### **2. Donor Management**

- ◆ The ideal management of the multiorgan donor has been previously published.[3](#page-26-5) β-Adrenergic inotropic support should be avoided if possible. Hormone replacement with thyroxine (T4) infusion, vasopressin, and methylprednisolone should be administered routinely, regardless of baseline LV function. Systemic blood pressure should be titrated to less than 120 mm Hg after appropriate volume resuscitation. Anemia should be corrected because this will cause hypotension. A PCO2 of 30 to 35 mm Hg should be sought to decrease PVR. In the common presentation of systemic hypertension, therapy should consist of sodium nitroprusside or short-acting beta blockers such as esmolol.
- ◆ The retrieval team should strive to keep the donor heart relaxed and undistended. Intraoperative management of the donor includes inhaled anesthetic agents for blood pressure control and judicious volume resuscitation to maintain a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8 to 12 mm Hg. Right ventricular (RV) distention or stress is often noted when the systemic blood pressure rises above 110 to 120 mm Hg.

# **Step 3. Operative Steps**

#### **1. Visualization**

- ◆ On arrival, the retrieval team checks donor blood type against that of the recipient, as well as donor consent, certification of brain death, and other pertinent data.
- ◆ Communication between the donor and recipient surgical teams is essential. A nonscrubbed assistant is preferred who can keep the recipient team apprised as to expected cross-clamp and travel times.
- ◆ A generous median sternotomy is performed and extended into a midline abdominal incision. A short retractor is placed, with the cross bar at the superior aspect of the incision so as not to disturb exposure for the liver transplantation team.
- ◆ A pericardial cradle is created with stay sutures. The lung transplantation team may choose to secure these with clamps so that access to the pleural spaces is maintained.
- ◆ The heart is visualized and inspected for adequate function. The right ventricle is readily visible. One should note a relaxed right atrium, as well as a relaxed outflow tract. The heart should be displaced gently to assess left ventricular (LV) function and to look for a left SVC. When examining the posterolateral wall, hypotension commonly occurs. The rate of return to normal hemodynamics is a good indicator of myocardial function.
- ◆ In older donors, the coronary arteries should be palpated. Usually, a cardiac catheterization study will have been done. Diffuse coronary artery disease may not be obstructive but would still preclude donation. Extensive calcifications, although not necessarily stenotic, also preclude use of the organ. The donor heart is examined for signs of long-standing hypertension such as increased epicardial fat, tortuous coronary arteries, and a shortened ascending aorta with effacement of the sinotubular junction.
- ◆ An estimate of heparin and clamp time is determined with the other organ retrieval teams. The timing of recipient and donor operations is individualized secondary to reoperative status, ventricular assist device (VAD) excision, and anticipated travel times. My team usually allocates 2 hours for sternal reentry and explantation of an implantable VAD. I would time the donor cross-clamp so that arrival of the allograft in the recipient operating room would coincide with the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass. In cases for which total ischemic time is expected to be prolonged, cardiopulmonary bypass is often initiated 10 to 20 minutes prior to anticipated allograft arrival to allow for recipient cardiectomy.

- ◆ The aorta and pulmonary artery are separated to allow for aortic cross-clamping without interfering with pulmonary artery cannulation by the lung team. The SVC is mobilized from the right pulmonary artery. I usually isolate the SVC with a silk tie, which is subsequently tied after the aortic cross-clamp is applied.
- ◆ A back table setup is prepared and checked at this time to allow efficient preparation and packaging. The packing plastic bag is prepared in a large basin filled with iced saline slurry. The bag is filled with 1 L of the same solution that is used for flush cooling. This setup keeps the storage solution cold and prevents ice from coming into direct contact with the heart. An aortic cross-clamp is also selected.

# **2. Organ Recovery**

- ◆ Preparation is made to allow adequate suction and venting into the right chest. The pericardium adjacent to the IVC is divided to allow drainage into the right chest. This drainage can be collected with a pool suction. Another pool suction is prepared for insertion into the IVC, which will be incised.
- ◆ The cardioplegia bag should be kept in a cooler until just before heparin is given. An assistant or preservationist hangs and administers the cardioplegia. Heparin (300 U/kg) is administered intravenously. A cardioplegia cannula is inserted into the ascending aorta, just distal to the fat pad. After securing the cardioplegia cannula, the tubing is passed off to be connected to the preservative solution bag. The line is de-aired, clamped, and connected. Cardioplegic administration can be performed with either a pressure monitoring line or a pressurized infuser. Care should be taken to avoid pressures higher than 200 mm Hg. Measuring cardioplegia pressure is particularly important for pediatric and adolescent donors in whom the aorta is small, and pressure estimation by palpation is unreliable. Flush cooling at supraphysiologic pressures may cause edema of the donor organ, potentially leading to dysfunction.
- ◆ The flush cooling sequence is initiated by the cardiac team in coordination with the abdominal team. The aortic clamp is applied and cardioplegic solution administered. The SVC is ligated and the IVC is hemisected anteriorly to vent the right heart. The left heart is similarly vented by an incision into the left atrial appendage. A suction catheter is placed inside the IVC and in the right pleural space [\(Fig. 33.2](#page-7-0)).
- ◆ I usually infuse 3 L of cold Celsior solution (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) and then store the explanted heart in 500 mL of cold Celsior solution. I avoid topical ice because it can lead to crystallization of epicardial fat and occasional hemorrhage of epicardial microvessels. The heart is usually cooled to a temperature of 4° to 10°C (39.2°–50°F).
- ◆ It usually takes 6 to 8 minutes to flush-cool the heart. During this time, blood is observed clearing from the coronary arteries, and the surgeon ensures that there is no right or LV distention.
- ◆ Once the cardioplegia is given, the aorta should be transected if pneumoplegia is still being given, as is usually the case. This should help further to vent the left-sided cardiac chambers and to prevent the pneumoplegia from washing out the cardioplegia.
- ◆ The IVC is then divided. I usually have the abdominal team provide caudal traction to the liver. As described previously, most of the suprahepatic IVC is kept with the liver resection. The heart is elevated and retracted to the left to expose the right pulmonary veins for division at the pericardial reflection. The heart is then retracted superiorly and to the right to expose the left pulmonary veins. As described previously, if the heart is the sole thoracic organ being procured, the pulmonary veins are divided at the pericardial reflection. If the lungs are also being harvested, a left atrial incision is made between the coronary sinus and the insertion of the pulmonary veins ([Fig. 33.3](#page-7-1)).

**Figure 33.3** Incision lines for combined heart and lung retrieval.

- ◆ The main pulmonary artery is divided proximal to the pneumoplegia cannula site at the bifurcation. Again, the surgeon should look inside to follow the contour of the bifurcation and protect the pulmonary valve. I prefer to separate the heart from the lung block in situ (vs. on the back table).
- ◆ Downward traction is applied to the aorta, and it is divided beyond the clamp site. The azygos vein is divided, as is the SVC above the site of ligation. The heart is then delivered to the back table and placed in the cold preservation solution.

### **Step 4. Postretrieval Care**

- ◆ Donor pericardium and paratracheal lymph nodes are harvested at this point, if this was not done previously. The pericardium is packaged with the donor heart. If needed, this can be used for patches or pledgets during the recipient operation. In congenital cases, this pericardium is also useful for augmentation of native, recipient pulmonary arteries or other great vessels.
- ◆ A rapid assessment is performed to assess surgical damage, valve competency, and the presence of a patent foramen ovale, which should be closed. I inspect the ostia of the coronary arteries to rule out undetected disease or abnormal takeoffs, which may predispose to sudden cardiac death. Finally, the junction of the IVC and right atrium are inspected to ensure that an adequate rim of atrial tissue is present next to the coronary sinus.
- ◆ The remaining back table dissection may be performed before packaging. This dissection includes preparing the left atrial cuff for anastomosis by dividing the pulmonary veins from superior to inferior on either side and incising the posterior left atrium (in case of solitary heart retrieval). The mitral valve is inspected carefully. The pulmonary artery is splayed open and dissected away from the left atrium and SVC on the right. This will already have been done in situ when lung retrieval has been carried out.
- ◆ The heart is placed in 500 mL of preservation solution inside a plastic jar. This jar is then placed into two separate sterile bags. The outer bag is subsequently contaminated during transport, allowing for subsequent retrieval of the inner sterile bag and jar. The jar and overlying bags are then placed in a cooler surrounded by ice.

#### **Step 5. Pearls and Pitfalls**

- ◆ Frequent communication is necessary with the recipient team to convey adjustments in time to optimize donor ischemic time. I instruct the donor team to notify us just prior to anticipated cross-clamping, on departure from the donor operating room, on flight departure and arrival (or estimated ground travel time) and, finally, when they are approximately 10 minutes away from the recipient operating room.
- ◆ Donor blood pressure will rise with stimulation. Inhaled anesthetic agents should be used to keep systolic blood pressure at a maximum of 120 mm Hg. Transfusion of the donor with packed red blood cells should be encouraged to avoid anemia (hemoglobin < 8 g/dL).
- ◆ Often, the initial donor incision is performed by the abdominal retrieval teams because they generally require 1.5 to 3 hours to prepare their organs for retrieval. Careful inspection for hemostasis—particularly thymic and phrenic vessels—can avoid anemia. In general, discourage the abdominal team from contaminating the thorax with intraabdominal contents (e.g., omentum, small bowel). Particularly in cases of trauma, these structures may no longer be sterile and could potentially lead to life-threatening infection in the cardiac allograft.
- ◆ Focused communication with the lung harvest team is needed to avoid cardiac distention, which can be extremely deleterious to the posttransplantation function of the donor heart. It is important to wait until the left atrial appendage is vented and the heart is arrested before

- starting lung perfusion. This also prevents the lung perfusate from displacing the cardioplegia solution from the aortic root. If the cardioplegia has finished infusing before the pneumoplegia, the aorta must be transected and suction carefully advanced toward the aortic valve to prevent the pneumoplegia from washing out the cardioplegia. Pneumoplegia may be toxic to the heart and coronary arteries.
- ◆ In severe chest or abdominal trauma, the surgeon must always be alert to the possibility of hematomas around the aorta or innominate vein, which may be a source of important blood loss on opening the chest.
- ◆ Excessive manipulation of the donor heart during flush cooling may cause transient aortic valve incompetence, with ensuing right and LV distention, and therefore should be avoided.
- ◆ On excision, it is crucial to avoid damage to the coronary sinus during division of the IVC and left atrium. Suboptimal length of the SVC can lead to sinoatrial node damage.

# **Adult Recipient**

# **Step 1. Surgical Anatomy**

- ◆ The recipient's pericardial space is often enlarged, making it prone to postoperative effusions because of the relatively smaller donor heart size.
- ◆ Even during a planned bicaval anastomosis, the SVC and IVC do not need to be mobilized away from adjacent structures. Although I favor transecting the SVC, necessitating separation from the right pulmonary artery posteriorly, many surgeons preserve the posterior wall of the right atrium. Preserving the posterior wall provides greater flexibility in sizing the length of the donor to recipient SVC anastomosis.
- ◆ The right pulmonary artery is often enlarged, thin, and friable owing to heart failure. It is posterior to the aorta and may be injured during aortic clamping or excision of the recipient native heart.

#### **Step 2. Preoperative Considerations**

#### **1. Recipient Selection**

- ◆ The revised listing criteria have recently been updated by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT).[8](#page-26-7) In general, there are few absolute contraindications to heart transplant, and many prior absolute contraindications are now relative. Psychosocial factors increasingly have been recognized as important determinants of long-term outcome, and a history of noncompliance and persistent substance abuse should raise concerns about the recipient's willingness to adhere to the prescribed regimen following transplantation. A recent history of potentially metastatic cancer is perhaps the only other absolute contraindication to transplantation. Many other relative contraindications can be overcome by bridging with a durable VAD, including obesity, pulmonary hypertension, and renal insufficiency.[9](#page-26-8)
- ◆ It is important to perform a right heart catheterization immediately prior to transplantation to verify that the PVR is less than 4 Wood units. The absolute value of the pulmonary artery pressure itself can be misleading with regard to pulmonary hypertension because it may be elevated passively secondary to a high left atrial pressure. I generally target a transpulmonary gradient (TPG—mean pulmonary artery pressure minus pulmonary capillary wedge pressure)

- of less than 12 mm Hg. When this is found to be elevated pretransplantation, I attempt vasodilator therapy with sodium nitroprusside and diuretic therapy with intravenous (IV) furosemide. If the TPG remains higher than 15 mm Hg, I will consider canceling the planned transplantation. This is particularly important in the setting of valvular cardiomyopathy, in adults with congenital heart disease, or in those with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
- ◆ Due to their disease process, a recipient's heart and pericardial cavity are usually significantly dilated. Therefore, apart from acute fulminant myocarditis or acute massive myocardial infarction, oversizing a donor to recipient is rarely problematic. Caution should be exercised with extreme height mismatches because an extended donor SVC-IVC length can lead to obstruction when the recipient is significantly shorter.
- ◆ Due to current organ allocation criteria, most transplant recipients are deemed as high status and inpatients at the time of being offered an organ. It is increasingly rare to admit an outpatient for transplantation unless she or he is supported by a VAD. The most recent ISHLT registry report has suggested that almost 50% of transplant recipients are currently bridged with a mechanical circulatory support device[.4](#page-26-1)

# **2. Preparation, Timing, and Coordination With Donor Operation**

- ◆ If the recipient is anticoagulated, warfarin may be reversed with vitamin K, 2 mg, given intravenously as a slow infusion. Although central venous lines (permitting the insertion of a Swan-Ganz catheter for the assessment of PVR) are routinely inserted preoperatively, the recipient does not undergo induction of anesthesia until the donor heart has been found to be satisfactory.
- ◆ Inotropic agent infusions are continued until cardiopulmonary bypass is initiated. Automatic defibrillators are usually adjusted after entry into the operating room. I favor maintaining pacing and antitachycardiac pacing therapies while deactivating shock therapies. In pacerdependent patients, the device is set to dual chamber sense, dual chamber pace, and 0 response to sensing (DDO) mode to permit the use of electrocautery.
- ◆ I usually allow 1 hour from skin incision to arrival of the donor heart in recipients who have not undergone a previous sternotomy. In patients with a prior sternotomy, this period is extended to 2 hours to allow adequate time for complete dissection of the native heart before heparin administration. In patients with a prior sternotomy, patent internal mammary artery grafts, biventricular failure (with high RV pressure), or assist device, the surgeon may consider exposure of the femoral artery and vein.
- ◆ Most multiorgan donor procedures require 1 to 3 hours from visualization to cross-clamping. An additional 30 minutes is needed for organ perfusion, excision, and back table dissection and packaging. It is advisable to err on the side of the recipient team's being ahead of the donor team. Again, frequent communication between the retrieval and implantation teams is essential

### **Step 3. Operative Steps**

#### **1. Initiation of Cardiopulmonary Bypass and Native Heart Excision**

◆ As with any redo cardiac surgical procedure, after safe sternal reentry, the ascending aorta is mobilized to permit arterial cannulation and subsequent transfusion, if required. I then normally expose the right atrial free wall to again permit urgent cannulation should the need arise. At

- this point, the IVC and SVC are dissected and prepared for direct cannulation. As mentioned previously, in high-risk redo cases, consideration is given to percutaneous femoral cannulation for arterial and/or venous access. The heart is manipulated minimally owing to extreme irritability and possible dislodgment of a left atrial or ventricular thrombus.
- ◆ Ideally, cardiac dissection is completed prior to the administration of heparin. Time permitting, I favor packing the pericardium for 5 minutes to allow for normal coagulation. Heparin is then given when the donor heart is about 30 minutes away. Direct vena cava cannulation is accomplished with low-profile, high-flow cannulae. Cardiopulmonary bypass can be initiated 10 to 20 minutes before the donor heart arrives. VADs are deactivated, and the cannulae and grafts are clamped before cardiopulmonary bypass is initiated. Sometimes it is safer to cannulate the IVC after the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass. The donor heart is kept in its transport cooler during native heart excision. Carbon dioxide is insufflated into the pericardial well at a rate of 4 L/min. Ultrafiltration is routinely used during cardiopulmonary bypass, and the hematocrit is maintained at 28%.
- ◆ The recipient is allowed to drift to 33°C (91.4°F) and the SVC and IVC are snared to isolate the right heart. Cardiopulmonary bypass flow is maintained at an index of 2.4 L/min/m2 . I then routinely clamp the ascending aorta. The recipient heart does not require cardioplegia.
- ◆ The first incision is usually at the superior junction of the SVC and right atrium. This incision is extended inferiorly to approximately 3 to 4 cm from the IVC cannula. This incision allows visualization of the interatrial septum, which is then incised to enter the left atrium.
- ◆ Automated implantable cardioverter defibrillator and pacing leads are cut flush with the SVC after gentle traction is applied so the remnant may retract out of the field. I usually excise the pulse generator at the end of the procedure while waiting for hemostasis to occur.
- ◆ Once the left atrium is entered, the incision is carried superiorly into the dome. At this point, the aorta and pulmonary artery are transected as close to the valves as possible to allow for maximal length. From an immunologic perspective, it is preferable to have more recipient tissue than donor tissue.
- ◆ Once the aorta and pulmonary artery have been transected, the incision in the dome of the left atrium is extended to the left atrial appendage. At this point, I visualize all four pulmonary veins draining into the left atrium. The lateral left atrial incision is then carried down, maintaining an adequate rim of tissue above the orifice of the pulmonary veins. At the inferior border of the left atrium, I focus on the right side and visualize the coronary sinus. The native heart is then excised along the atrioventricular groove, maintaining the coronary sinus with the explanted heart. The edges of the left atrial cuff are cauterized, as is the exposed area of the interatrial septum. Large thebesian veins require suture ligation.
- ◆ If an assist device pump is present, the aorta is excised just caudal to the outflow graft anastomosis. The LV apex can be particularly challenging to mobilize and, if time constraints are worrisome, I will transect the LV apex and explant the VAD following donor heart implant.
- ◆ A small (14 F) vent catheter is placed in the right superior pulmonary vein and advanced into the left inferior pulmonary vein to collect the bronchial return. The most proximal opening must be in the most dependent part of the field. This helps exposure and prevents rewarming of the donor heart after completion of the left atrial anastomosis. Just prior to completion of the LA anastomosis, this vent is repositioned across the mitral valve to decompress the left ventricle.
- ◆ As described previously, I favor transection of the SVC at its junction with the right atrium. The SVC is mobilized away from the right pulmonary artery to provide an adequate sewing cuff. Some surgeons favor retaining the posterior wall of the right atrium [\(Fig. 33.4\)](#page-13-0) and sewing the donor SVC and IVC directly to the posterior wall of the right atrium.
- ◆ At this point, the donor heart is removed from the cooler and brought into the operating field. If the donor surgeon has not done so, the pulmonary artery, left atrial, and aortic cuffs are prepared. The atrial septum is inspected for a patent foramen ovale, which must be closed to prevent right to left shunting in case of transiently elevated pulmonary artery pressures postoperatively.

### **2. Donor Heart Implantation**

- ◆ The traditional order of anastomoses is the left atrium, IVC, SVC, pulmonary artery, and aorta. Many surgeons will do the left atrium and then aortic anastomoses first to allow for aortic cross-clamp removal and reperfusion. This is particularly useful in cases of prolonged ischemic times. The following description refers to the traditional order of anastomoses.[10](#page-26-9)
- ◆ The use of cardioplegia during donor heart implant is variable. Many surgeons prefer a cut and sew technique and simply reperfuse the heart by removing the aortic cross-clamp at the end of the procedure. In most cases, and particularly those with prolonged cold ischemic times, I favor using intermittent cold blood cardioplegia. I usually give a dose prior to implantation, following the left atrial anastomosis, just prior to the pulmonary artery anastomosis, and a so-called hot shot just prior to removing the aortic cross-clamp.[11](#page-26-10)
- ◆ Immunotherapy varies considerably among centers. At my center**,** I use 1 g of IV methylprednisolone prior to recipient incision and an additional 500 mg IV at the removal of the aortic cross-clamp.
- ◆ The key to donor implantation starts with the correct orientation of the left atrial anastomosis. The donor heart is wrapped in a large, cold, saline-soaked gauze and placed in a small basin, with the left atrium exposed and oriented superiorly. I routinely mark the orientation by placing a long 3-0 polypropylene suture at the apex of the remnant left atrial appendage and another at the junction between the IVC and inferior aspect of the left atrium. These sutures are passed through the same locations in the donor heart so that the orientation of the posterior left atrium anastomosis is now fixed in the correct manner.
- ◆ I begin the posterior left atrial anastomosis with forehand suturing patterns from the left atrial appendage caudally to the previously placed IVC marking suture. Usually, after three or four passes of the superior marking suture, the heart must be lowered into the pericardial cavity. It is useful to have a second assistant place traction on the inferior marking suture while placing a suction catheter into the donor's left atrium, exposing the anastomotic line. The inferior marking suture is tied and one arm tied to the suture that closed the posterior wall of the left atrium. One arm is then passed internally to create a mattressed second layer closure travelling back to the left atrial appendage. The advantages of this second layer include hemostasis and burying of the raw cut edges of the left atria. The mattress suture provides endothelial apposition that is less thrombogenic. The mattress suture then exits the left atrium at the level of the left atrial appendage marker and tied to the original arm [\(Fig. 33.5\)](#page-16-0).
- ◆ I then use the longer suture of these two arms to begin closure of the dome and anterior left atrium. At approximately the midportion of the interatrial septum, the inferior suture is brought forward to complete the anastomosis. As noted previously, during the transition from the superior to inferior suture, the left atrial vent is repositioned across the mitral valve into the left ventricle.
- ◆ The use of a bicaval technique is now nearly universally adopted because it has been associated with improved RV function and less tricuspid valve regurgitation[.12](#page-26-11) Many surgeons find it easier to perform the IVC anastomosis immediately after the left atrial anastomosis. This ensures a tension-free connection that remains relaxed as the aorta and pulmonary artery lengths are adjusted accordingly. The biatrial technique is rarely used in my adult practice. It may be required in cases of congenital anomaly, such as a persistent left SVC. In such a case, I still attempt to perform a direct SVC anastomosis in addition to a right atrial cuff anastomosis.
- ◆ The posterior wall of the IVC is anastomosed first, starting with the medial (assistant) side and finishing on the lateral (surgeon) side. I then bring the second arm of the initial suture to complete the anterior wall of the IVC [\(Fig. 33.6\)](#page-16-1).

**Figure 33.6** The inferior vena cava anastomosis.

- ◆ The length of the recipient's native SVC is preserved. Nevertheless, the donor SVC up to the azygos branch point is usually required to produce a tension-free anastomosis. This is because the dome of the recipient native left atrium is usually enlarged, causing the donor SVC to be displaced medially after completion of the left atrial anastomosis. In case of size mismatch, the donor right atrium can be incised at the superior aspect of the IVC and extended appropriately to match the recipient IVC [\(Fig. 33.7](#page-19-0)).
- ◆ The donor pulmonary artery is separated from the aorta. The location of the left main coronary artery, which can be seen posteriorly, is noted.
- ◆ The donor pulmonary artery is trimmed so that there is about 1.5 cm of tissue beyond the pulmonary valve. A double-loaded 4-0 polypropylene suture on an SH or SH-1 needle is used for this anastomosis. It is constructed as described previously. Size mismatch is corrected both posteriorly and anteriorly. If the tissue appears friable, a strip of treated pericardium is incorporated into the suture line ([Fig. 33.8\)](#page-19-1).
- ◆ At the completion of the pulmonary arterial anastomosis, systemic rewarming is initiated. The recipient aorta is trimmed 1 to 1.5 cm proximal to the aortic clamp. The donor aorta is gently pulled superiorly to the right of the recipient's aorta so that the edges overlap. The donor aorta is usually trimmed distal to the aortic fat pad with an anterior to posterior bevel to enlarge the diameter available for the anastomosis. It is common for the donor aorta to be significantly smaller than the recipient aorta. It must be kept in mind that the lesser curve of the aorta is shorter than the greater curve. A 0.5-cm margin is maintained on both the donor and recipient sides to allow for a secure suture line. The surgeon must note the location of the left main ostium, this time by looking into the donor aortic root. A 1-cm margin is needed to avoid distortion of the left main coronary artery.

◆ This suture line is constructed in the same way as that of the pulmonary artery. Size mismatch is corrected mostly anteriorly. [Fig. 33.9](#page-22-0) demonstrates the completed transplantation, with IVC augmentation of the donor right atrium.

# **3. Reperfusion**

- ◆ The LV vent is initially placed on suction, and the heart is filled by partially clamping the venous lines. I also place a de-airing hole in the ascending aorta. Alternatively, a cardioplegia catheter can be inserted into the root to administer the terminal hot shot, as described previously. This then becomes useful as a root vent. The anesthesiologist is instructed to place positive pressure on the lungs (Valsalva maneuver). This maneuver also effectively de-airs the pulmonary veins, which frequently trap air. The aortic cross-clamp is then removed to reperfuse the heart.
- ◆ Once a siphon is established with the aortic root and/or LV vent, they are placed on gravity to prevent air entrainment through the suture holes.
- ◆ During reperfusion, I inspect all anastomotic lines for hemostasis. Filling the heart facilitates inspection of the IVC and SVC anastomoses. This is also the best time to retract the heart and inspect the left atrial suture line.
- ◆ Electrical activity usually returns spontaneously in good donor hearts. Nevertheless, temporary epicardial atrial and ventricular pacing wires are inserted in all patients. Inotropic support is now initiated because it is better to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass with a hyperdynamic state than with a dysfunctional heart that further exacerbates poor RV function. I favor an initial infusion of epinephrine (0.05 µg/kg/min) and milrinone (0.5 µg/kg/min). Although the epinephrine can be titrated based on hemodynamics, I usually maintain the milrinone infusion until the patient is extubated, at which point the right ventricle is no longer stressed by positive-pressure ventilation.
- ◆ It is not unusual for transplant recipients to come to the operating room on amiodarone and/ or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Both these agents have been shown to increase the risk of perioperative vasoplegia[.13](#page-26-12) When vasoplegia has been problematic during cardiopulmonary bypass, I avoid the use of milrinone due to its vasodilatory properties. Arginine vasopressin and/or methylene blue can be used aggressively in the treatment of profound vasoplegia[.14](#page-26-13)

#### **4. Separating From Cardiopulmonary Bypass**

◆ Once an adequate heart rate, higher than 90 beats/min, is achieved (either spontaneous or with pacing) and inotropic infusions are in place, ventilation is initiated. The root vent and LV vent remain on gravity drainage to aid in de-airing, which is verified by transesophageal monitoring. The perfusionist is instructed to decrease forward flow slowly while simultaneously filling the heart to a CVP of 5 mm Hg. At this point, if de-airing is adequate, as verified by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), the LV vent is removed. I keep the aortic vent in situ until the patient has been completely weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass to reduce the risk of air embolizing from the LV cavity to the right coronary artery.

- ◆ It is important to maintain an adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP; > 65 mm Hg) to optimize RV perfusion. Norepinephrine and vasopressin infusions can be titrated as needed. As described previously, if the MAP is higher than 80 mm Hg, epinephrine can be weaned but the milrinone infusion should be maintained. Arterial and/or venous vasodilators are used for persistent hypertension.
- ◆ If RV function is suboptimal, despite high-dose inotropic support (> 0.5 µg/kg/min of milrinone or > 0.1 µg/kg/min of epinephrine), then I usually initiate inhaled nitric oxide or epoprostenol (Flolan) therapy. Many centers routinely use inhalational agents in all transplant recipients in the early postoperative period[.15](#page-26-14)
- ◆ If hemodynamics remain poor, despite maximal medical therapy, consideration should be given to short-term mechanical circulatory support. It is often difficult (even with TEE guidance) to differentiate primary RV dysfunction from secondary RV dysfunction due to a hypokinetic left ventricle. A hypokinetic right ventricle leads to underfilling of the left ventricle, which may mask underlying LV dysfunction. Therefore, the device of choice in this situation is either central or peripheral extracorporeal membrane oxygen (ECMO) support[.16](#page-26-15)

#### **5. Closure**

- ◆ All foreign bodies from assist devices are removed at this time. In the case of paracorporeal devices, the exit sites of the IVC and SVC are excised and closed primarily. The closure may require retention sutures. In the case of an implantable device, the driveline exit site is similarly closed. Peritoneal defects should be repaired because blood is a significant abdominal irritant. All nonbiologic material must be removed.
- ◆ As described previously, during the reperfusion period I routinely pack the pericardial cavity and suture lines with surgical sponges. While protamine is being administered to fully reverse heparinization (even if extracorporeal life support [ECLS] has been used), the pulse generator is removed from its subclavicular location.
- ◆ The mediastinum is drained with a tube anterior to the heart that is positioned along the right pericardial edge to avoid RV compression. An additional drain is used behind the heart.
- ◆ I explore both pleura with small incisions in the apex to drain any preexisting effusions. Usually, the anterior mediastinal tube is adequate to drain air from both spaces.
- ◆ I routinely close the native pericardium (even in cases of redo sternotomy) to achieve two goals[.17](#page-26-16) First, mediastinal bleeding is compartmentalized into the anterior and pericardial spaces. Bleeding from the pericardial tube necessitates reexploration, but bleeding from the anterior mediastinal tubes usually reflects sternal and chest wall bleeding and can observed carefully. Second, in the event of subsequent reoperation (for aortic or valvular pathology), sternal reentry is facilitated.[18](#page-26-17)
- ◆ The sternal edges are covered with vancomycin paste to minimize the risk of infection. Sternal closure is routine as per any cardiac procedure using a median sternotomy.

#### **Step 4. Postoperative Care**

- ◆ Postoperative immunosuppression varies among centers. Some prefer an induction strategy with antilymphocyte therapy, whereas others proceed directly to triple therapy consisting of steroids, a calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine or tacrolimus), and mycophenolate mofetil.[19](#page-26-18)
- ◆ Routine intensive care monitoring is required for all cardiac transplant recipients. In contrast to other patients, transplant recipients should have cautious volume replacement and avoid blood products that may cause subsequent antibody sensitization. The CVP must be monitored

- closely because it may be the first clue of underlying RV dysfunction. A rising systolic pulmonary artery pressure in the setting of a stable or falling CVP is a sign of RV recovery and should not be cause for concern.
- ◆ Oliguria and a rising serum creatinine level is not uncommon and may prompt the use of a calcineurin-free immune strategy during the early postoperative period.[20](#page-26-19) Again, in the setting of worsening renal function, one must pay close attention to volume status because an accumulated positive balance can lead to worsening RV performance and further exacerbation of renal function.
- ◆ If hemodynamics are acceptable, inhalational therapies are weaned to facilitate endotracheal extubation. Often, the best treatment for marginal RV function is extubation, which converts positive-pressure ventilation to negative pressure. If extubation is not possible, switching from positive pressure to negative pressure (pressure support) is preferred.

# **Step 5. Pearls and Pitfalls**

- ◆ Communication between the donor and recipient teams is essential for optimizing both cold and warm ischemic times. In addition, the donor team needs to be aware of any need for donor pericardium, extended aorta (for aneurysmal recipient aorta), branch pulmonary arteries (for congenital cases requiring reconstruction), or a long SVC. When necessary, donor crossclamping is delayed to allow the recipient team to catch up. It is preferable to have the recipient cannulated and heparinized awaiting donor arrival than to have the donor organ remain in storage during recipient dissection.
- ◆ Implanting the donor heart usually takes about 45 to 60 minutes. This is considered warm ischemia time.
- ◆ RV dysfunction is the most common pitfall because of recipient PVR. In addition to the aforementioned treatment plan, one should consider pacing to a rate of 90 to 110 beats/min. This increases cardiac output and helps prevent overdistention of the right ventricle. The latter causes decreased coronary perfusion and poor function.
- ◆ Postoperative bleeding is a major concern because extensive transfusions will cause a transient rise in PVR and secondary RV dysfunction. Along these lines, cardiopulmonary bypass time should be minimized. In recipients with previous surgery, bypass should be delayed until as much of the dissection as possible has been carried out. This must be weighed against the risk of prolonging cold ischemia time, which may be acceptable.
- ◆ Adults with congenital heart disease often present the challenge of pulmonary artery or other great vessel reconstruction at the time of transplantation. This may require the use of additional donor conduit or pericardial patches or polytetrafluoroethylene graft material. Many of these recipients also have a greatly increased bronchial collateral circulation. They may require moderate to deep hypothermia (22°–28°C; 71.6°–82.4°F) to reduce this flow and minimize potential warm ischemia of the donor heart. The increased return to the left-sided chambers also requires a larger donor size than usual, usually 20% greater than the recipient.
- ◆ When performing transplantation in a recipient who has been bridged with a biventricular assist device, removal of the right VAD before cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass should be considered. This is usually well tolerated and allows for a more extensive dissection before anticoagulation.
- ◆ The presence of a left SVC without an innominate bridge warrants preservation of the recipient coronary sinus and performance of a biatrial anastomosis. The SVC should also be cannulated during cardiopulmonary bypass. Alternatively (in cases of redo), a drop vent can be placed in the recipient coronary sinus to return left SVC effluent to the pump circuit.
- ◆ The pulmonary anastomosis is rarely too short and commonly too long, causing kinking and right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction.[21](#page-26-20) When sizing the pulmonary arteries, err on the side of being too short. It is possible to sew the sinotubular junction of the donor to the pericardial reflection of the recipient and still be adequate in length.

- ◆ In patients with high preoperative PVR, donor size mismatch, or prolonged ischemic times, some surgeons advocate a back table tricuspid valve repair. This is achieved via the IVC incision and consists of a DeVega-type annuloplasty[.22](#page-26-21)
- ◆ Most postoperative surgical bleeding comes from the aorta because of size mismatch and friable recipient tissue. Trimming the donor aorta with a bevel that accentuates the natural curve of the ascending aorta, as described previously, helps adjust the size mismatch. The surgeon should observe the left main orifice inside the donor aorta to keep at least 1 cm of tissue distal to this on the posterior aspect. There should be a low threshold for performing a double suture line for the aortic anastomosis; it adds very little time to the warm ischemia and provides great benefit with regard to bleeding.
- ◆ Due to common size mismatch between the donor and recipient vessels, a so-called pseudo-SVC obstruction can occur, as manifested by turbulent flow across the SVC anastomosis. A direct pressure gradient should be determined intraoperatively with a needle transducer. A gradient over 7 mm Hg should prompt revision of the SVC anastomosis, usually requiring pericardial patch augmentation. A percutaneous approach is also possible to correct this problem.[23](#page-26-22)
- ◆ Recently, there has been a trend toward earlier institution of mechanical circulatory support in patients with primary graft dysfunction. This strategy avoids persistent hypotension, which aggravates RV dysfunction and also prevents end-organ injury to the liver and kidney.[24](#page-26-23)
