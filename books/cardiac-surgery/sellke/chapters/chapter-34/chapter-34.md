# **Step 1. Preoperative Considerations**

- ◆ Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is an increasingly recognized clinical entity. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common disease, with an annual incidence of about 100/100,000 in the United States. Many episodes of PE, however, are silent; from 30% to 50% of patients with CTEPH have no history of a PE. Patients with a prior PE who do not have complete fibrinolysis of their clot may go on to have the residual clot remodel into a scar, which can occlude or narrow segmental, lobar, and even main pulmonary arteries with a fibrous plug, leading to pulmonary hypertension. The incidence of CTEPH after a documented PE has been reported in several studies, and a reasonable estimate is in the 4% to 5% range. The classic study by Pengo and colleagues has suggested a 3.8% incidence of CTEPH after a PE.1 A more recent study has suggested a 4.8% incidence of CTEPH after a PE.2 Risk factors for CTEPH are listed in [Table 34.1.](#page-2-0) Although many hypercoagulable states have been documented in CTEPH patients (e.g., antithrombin III deficiency, protein C, protein S, factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation), they are not more prevalent than in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension. However, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is more prevalent in CTEPH patients.
- ◆ The diagnostic evaluation process is relatively straightforward; the most important factor is to consider this process when a patient presents with unexplained dyspnea with a clear chest radiograph and no obvious cardiopulmonary disease.4,5 Common presenting symptoms include dyspnea on exertion, atypical exertional chest discomfort, exercise intolerance, exertional presyncope or syncope, and hemoptysis. Common signs include signs of right heart failure with lower extremity edema, hypoxemia, and occasionally pulmonary artery (PA) flow murmurs.
- ◆ A ventilation-perfusion (V̇ /Q̇ ) scan will show substantial segmental defects in CTEPH, whereas a normal V̇ /Q̇ scan essentially eliminates CTEPH from further diagnostic consideration ([Fig. 34.1](#page-2-1)). An echocardiogram can then confirm significant pulmonary hypertension and screen for other cardiac disease. Complete pulmonary function tests are usually performed in older patients to screen for other pulmonary disease. In the United States, contrast-enhanced, pulmonary embolism (PE) protocol, chest computed tomography angiography (PE-CTA) is also performed to screen for other pulmonary disease and to demonstrate the PA anatomy. Findings on CT suggestive of CTEPH include a mosaic perfusion pattern, peripheral infarcts, a clot within the PA, narrowed pulmonary arteries, webs, and PA cutoffs. Dual-energy CTA is a promising imaging modality that may help better identify good operative candidates and can potentially offer a quantitative estimate of the degree of PA obstruction. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is often used in European centers instead of CTA to evaluate CTEPH patients.

## **Abstract**

Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension is an uncommon but increasingly recognized surgically treatable cause of pulmonary hypertension. Diagnosis is often delayed when patients present with unexplained exertional dyspnea in the absence of obvious cardiopulmonary disease. The standard evaluation process includes an echocardiogram, a ventilation perfusion scan, chest computed tomography angiography, and a right heart catheterization with a pulmonary angiogram. Most patients have surgically accessible disease when evaluated by an experienced hypertension team. The operation is standardized and performed through a median sternotomy, with standard bicaval and aortic cannulation. Hypothermic circulatory arrest is used to ensure a bloodless field. The key to the operation is selecting the proper dissection plane between the intima and the media, which allows the surgeon to dissect the specimen far out into the segmental and subsegmental pulmonary artery vessels. Anticoagulation is started early postoperatively as soon as mediastinal chest tube output is minimal. Most patients have a good result and operative mortality is now under 5% in most centers.

◆ A right heart catheterization is finally performed to measure the hemodynamics of the pulmonary circulation and obtain a two-plane pulmonary angiogram. Typical findings include delayed filling of vessels, branch occlusions, webs, pouches, and narrowed vessels [\(Fig. 34.2](#page-5-0)). A left heart catheterization is performed in those with suspected or reasonably possible coronary disease based on age and atherosclerosis risk factors. Ideally, an experienced multidisciplinary CTEPH team reviews the evaluation and makes an operability decision. In general, the degree of identified PA obstruction should match the pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). The vast majority of patients are operable in experienced centers if there are at least several segmental PA obstructions because imaging studies usually underestimate the degree of disease found at pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE). True distal disease should be avoided but is uncommon. Particularly in patients with acute or chronic PE, it is important to determine if there is still clotting in the deep venous systems of the legs. If vascular ultrasound suggests this, addition of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter should be considered. Although IVC filters are accompanied by some degree of controversy, if used in this setting, consideration should be given to removing them within 6 postoperative months. Although routine IVC filters used to be advocated for all patients with CTEPH, this is an area of unresolved controversy, and we usually do not place them in the typical patient. We have occasionally proceeded to surgery based solely on the V̇ /Q̇ scan and echocardiographic estimation of PA pressure in patients with classic histories who present acutely and are very ill.

#### **Step 2. Indications for Surgery**

◆ The indications to perform a PTE are straightforward—a symptomatic patient, significant pulmonary hypertension, segmental or proximal obstructive disease amenable to clearance with PTE, and the absence of severe comorbid disease. A controversial indication is symptomatic patients with only exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension. The reasons for performing a PTE include not only improving exercise capacity, but also stabilizing the longer term prognosis by preventing progression of distal PA arteriopathy and continued loss of right ventricular (RV) function. Patients with atrial level shunts can also become desaturated, particularly with exercise.

## **Step 3. Operative Steps**

- ◆ Although these patients can be hemodynamically tenuous, generally they can be anesthetized safely. A potential exception is the patient who may have acute or chronic PE, with severe right heart failure. To the extent possible, a PA catheter should be placed before the induction of anesthesia; rising central venous pressure (CVP) during the induction of anesthesia should trigger concern that right heart function is declining. Patients are positioned supine and prepped as per cardiac surgery routine. In the unusual situation in which a concomitant coronary bypass is planned, the preparation should include access for harvesting conduit. Concomitant cardiac procedures can be included and, in general, the operative strategy should include planning the concomitant procedure during rewarming after the period of hypothermic circulatory arrest needed for PTE.
- ◆ The anesthesia technique should take into consideration minimizing right heart afterload. Hypercarbia should be assiduously avoided, and mean airway pressure should be kept to a minimum. The addition of pulmonary vasodilators has not been required. Maintaining generous systemic pressure is key to maintaining stable right heart function. Transesophageal echocardiography is routinely included and, specifically, the following issues are examined:
  - ◆ Is there a clot in transit through the right heart?
  - ◆ Is there any patency of the interatrial septum?
  - ◆ Is there severe tricuspid valve regurgitation with a dilated tricuspid annulus?
  - ◆ Is right heart function impaired and to what degree?
- ◆ Routine median sternotomy is used, and the incision should not be made too short. These patients require generous exposure, particularly in the upper half of the thorax. The pericardium is then opened in the midline and fashioned into a cradle as usual. The superior vena cava (SVC) is then mobilized from under the pericardial reflection and off the right PA. The ascending aorta is mobilized free from the PA. Exposure and patient stability permitting, the right and left pulmonary arteries are mobilized from under their pericardial reflections. If any surgery is required through the right atrium, the IVC is also circumferentially mobilized.
- ◆ In a given cardiac surgery center, the cannulation and perfusion protocol described here can be modified according to institution custom and practice. Aortic cannulation is per routine. Through purse-string sutures placed on the right atrial free wall, angled cannulae are inserted. The SVC purse string should be close to the cavoatrial junction so that the SVC cannula reaches well into the SVC [\(Fig. 34.3](#page-8-0)). For the average-sized patient, a 28-mm, short-tipped cannula is placed in the IVC, and a 24 F, long-tipped cannula is directed into the SVC. The longer cannula is required for retraction of the SVC to avoid SVC obstruction while on cardiopulmonary bypass and while the SVC is being retracted. In patients who are over approximately 100 kg, a 31-mm cannula can be used in the IVC and a 28-mm, long-tipped cannula can be used in the SVC.
- ◆ During the initial setup for the case, the perfusionist should be asked to set the temperature on the heat exchanger jacket at 16°C (60.8°F) and to circulate the prime so cooling will start immediately. Bypass is then instituted. Following initial cooling, 100 mg of lidocaine can be given to prolong the period of cooling time before ventricular fibrillation occurs. When bypass is instituted, a small opening is made in the proximal left PA, and a cardiotomy suction catheter is inserted as a PA vent. A cardioplegia catheter is inserted in the ascending aorta for cardioplegia infusion. As much time as possible is allowed to elapse before it is necessary to cross-clamp the aorta because cooling time is often a limiting factor in the initial phase of the operation. When ventricular fibrillation occurs, the aorta is cross-clamped, and cardioplegia is administered. The cardioplegia cannula in the aorta may also be used as a left ventricular (LV) vent. The SVC and aorta are retracted apart with a Weitlaner retractor ([Fig. 34.4\)](#page-8-1). It is important to monitor the CVP as the retraction is applied to be sure that there is no SVC obstruction.

**Figure 34.3** This is the basic cardiac surgical setup used for perfusion. The long-tipped cannula in the SVC is used to prevent SVC obstruction when the SVC and ascending aorta are retracted apart. Note that in some circumstances (depending on individual patient anatomy), the SVC must be retracted to the left to permit access to the more distal parts of the right pulmonary artery.

**Figure 34.4** Retraction for exposure of the right pulmonary artery.

- ◆ An incision is made in the anterior wall of the right PA and is extended past the pars anterior origin and into the interlobar artery. A reduced-size cardiotomy suction catheter is placed distally to collect back-bleeding from the bronchial circulation. The PTE plane is initiated and, visibility permitting, as much of the initial dissection as possible is done.
- ◆ Selecting the endarterectomy plane is a critical step and may be initiated two ways. It can be either initiated on the back wall of the PA with a small scalpel [\(Fig. 34.5](#page-11-0)), or it can be initiated at the cut edge of the pulmonary arteriotomy with a fine scalpel or coronary endarterectomy instrument [\(Fig. 34.6\)](#page-11-1). The depth of the endarterectomy plane is a key point in this operation. The plane is subintimal and just into the media; if it is too deep, the wall of the PA can be at risk to dehisce, resulting in massive hemoptysis when the PA is repressurized. If it is too thin, the dissection will fail, with premature breaking off of the specimen.
- ◆ Although the endarterectomy specimen may sometimes be quite thin at the point of initiation, it becomes thicker as more pathology is approached distally in the endarterectomy. The correct plane is white and transverse fibers from the media are visible. The intima may have pale yellow plaques from a previous embolic clot. The plane is then continued distally, as much as possible, until back-bleeding limits visibility. Special forceps are used in a hand over hand manner, placing gentle traction on the specimen until the dissection is advanced as far as possible and the specimen gives somewhat. Then the specimen is grasped more distally with another pair of forceps and the first pair of forceps is released, all the time maintaining gentle traction ([Fig. 34.7](#page-11-2)). The endarterectomy plane is developed and extended using special fine,

**Figure 34.7** (A) Forceps especially designed for use in PTE. Four different types are used: regular length, with regular and fine jaws; and extra-long forceps, with regular and fine jaws. Two types of Jamieson dissecting suckers are shown. The straight one is used for most of the dissection, whereas the curved one is useful for the middle lobe and upper lobe at times due to its gentle curve. (B) Detail of tips of PTE forceps. The regular one is used for most work and the fine tip one is useful in small segmental branches.

blunt-tipped suction attached to the cardiotomy return—the Jamieson dissecting sucker ([Figs.](#page-14-0)  [34.8](#page-14-0) and [34.9\)](#page-14-1). The amount of endarterectomy that can be done is limited by collateral blood return affecting visibility.

- ◆ A small-caliber cardiotomy suction inserted into the distal interlobar artery and pars anterior can help extend the dissection. Usually, it is possible to carry an endarterectomy plane into the pars anterior and interlobar artery. When blood return obscures the view too much, hypothermic circulatory arrest should be instituted. Usually, cooling time before cross-clamp application plus cooling time during the initial dissection is adequate. With the perfusion protocol we use, and with the anticipated circulatory arrest times used, we generally cool for at least 45 minutes before instituting circulatory arrest.
- ◆ Cardioplegia is then renewed, magnesium is administered (100 mg/kg), and ice packs are placed around the patient's head, including under the occiput, to maintain local hypothermia. The circulation is then arrested, and several large breaths are given by the anesthesiologist to help exsanguinate the lungs, which improves exposure of the interior of the PA. A request to the perfusionist is made to call out the arrest time, starting 10 minutes into the arrest period and then every 5 minutes thereafter.
- ◆ The right-sided PTE then continues. It is our practice to endarterectomize the entire circulation into each segmental artery because often additional small obstructions are found that were not evident on imaging studies. One important point to keep in mind is that there will be the rare patient with long-standing disease that has calcified. Extreme caution is suggested when endarterectomizing such a territory because the calcified specimen may inadvertently carry the plane deeper than desired, resulting in compromise of the integrity of the PA.
- ◆ As the endarterectomy plane is developed, it is important to maintain gentle traction on the endarterectomy specimen; the hand over hand technique is continued to permit eversion of the artery being cleared. Using the dissecting Jamieson sucker, the remaining artery is gently pushed off the specimen circumferentially, gradually going deeper and deeper into the distal segmental artery. The specimen will eventually break off, ideally beyond the thickened intima, which has a pale yellow color, and into an area of now normal, almost translucent, intima. Depending on the difficulty and exposure, the right side can often be cleared with 15 to 20 minutes of circulatory arrest. If it is predicted that a longer time is going to be required—more than about 25 minutes—hypothermic reperfusion is reinstituted, and cardioplegia is renewed. Once the venous saturation reaches 100%, the circulation can be arrested again.
- ◆ The right-sided PTE is then completed. The small-caliber cardiotomy suction is then placed in the distal right PA, and hypothermic reperfusion is reinstituted. The pulmonary arteriotomy is closed using two layers of continuous 6-0 Prolene sutures ([Fig. 34.10](#page-14-2)). Cardioplegia is renewed.
- ◆ The heart is retracted upward and toward the right, using a retractor-mounted flexible retractor ([Fig. 34.11](#page-14-3)). The opening used for the PA vent is enlarged out on to the left PA. The PA vent catheter is then turned into the right PA origin. As on the right side, a thromboendarterectomy plane is initiated and, visibility permitting, the endarterectomy is carried as far distally as possible.
- ◆ Cardioplegia is renewed and, again, the circulation is arrested. The left PTE usually can be completed with one arrest because the disease is often less severe here. However, if additional time is needed for some reason, the same principle is applied and, rarely, an additional period of circulatory arrest is required.
- ◆ On completion of the left side, hypothermic reperfusion is reinstituted until the venous saturation reaches 100%, and full rewarming is begun; ice packs are removed from around the head. The PA vent is then withdrawn to the main PA. The left PA arteriotomy is closed again using two layers of continuous 6-0 Prolene sutures, starting distally and extending proximally. The suture line is then interrupted, leaving a small proximal opening large enough for the PA vent. The PA closure sutures and their needles are left in place for later closure of the rest of the pulmonary arteriotomy. [Fig. 34.12](#page-14-4) demonstrates a typical specimen retrieved after PTE.
- ◆ In general, we wait until the perfusion temperature reaches 30° to 32°C (86°–89.6°F) before removing the cross-clamp. Accordingly, additional cardioplegia usually has to be administered at this point.

- ◆ If concomitant cardiac surgery is required, such as patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure or the rare patient who needs tricuspid reconstruction or coronary bypass, it is done during the rewarming period so as to use this time effectively. On completion, the cardioplegia cannula in the aorta is placed on low-level suction, and the aortic cross-clamp is removed. Pacing wires are placed and, when appropriate and if needed, the patient is defibrillated. Once a stable rhythm is obtained with stable cardiac activity, the vent is withdrawn from the main PA, the right heart is de-aired by allowing it to fill and eject through the PA vent site, and the remaining small opening in the PA is closed using two layers of continuous 6-0 Prolene sutures, using the ends of the sutures that were left from the initial PA closure.
- ◆ In general, we try to rewarm the patients thoroughly. A warming blanket may be started underneath the patient, largely for maintenance of temperature after bypass. The room temperature is turned up after the cross-clamp is released. Cardiopulmonary bypass and hemodynamic management are routine at this point. Nitrous oxide or epoprostenol sodium (Flolan) have very rarely been required because good patient selection results in substantial PA pressure reduction, with resultant unloading of the right ventricle after PTE. When the right side is initially pressurized is the best time to examine the left and right PA suture lines in the event that any repair stitches are needed. In general, we have accomplished this using horizontal mattress sutures of 5-0 Prolene and pericardial pledgets. Also, the anesthesiologist is asked to check the airway to make sure that there is no blood at this time.
- ◆ Cardiopulmonary bypass is weaned, and the patient is decannulated in routine fashion. Heparin is reversed, as per routine. The mediastinum is drained using a traditional straight anterior chest tube, and a soft Silastic Blake drain (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) is placed posteriorly and brought up along the left side of the main PA. Many of these patients will have a prolonged period of serous drainage from the dissection around the PAs, and this small drain appears to reduce the incidence of troublesome pericardial effusions. Chest closure is per routine.

#### **Step 4. Postoperative Care**

- ◆ Postoperative care and, in particular, the duration of ventilator support, is determined by whether or not patients have a reperfusion injury and an increased alveolar-arterial (A-a) oxygen gradient. Although many patients can be extubated per intensive care unit (ICU) routine for cardiac surgery, attention to the trend in oxygenation and oxygen requirement will dictate the postoperative plan. If the A-a gradient increases, diuresis and positive-pressure ventilation will generally resolve any reperfusion injury in 24 to 48 hours.
- ◆ Anticoagulation is started at a low level the day after surgery. This can be according to institutional routine, using unfractionated heparin (aiming for an initial partial thromboplastin time [PTT] of ~50–55 seconds and increasing to 60–70 seconds over the first 2–3 postoperative days) or enoxaparin given bid in patients with normal renal function. If enoxaparin is used, the initial dose for the first postoperative day is about 0.6 mg/kg bid increasing to 0.9 mg/ kg bid over approximately 2 to 3 days. Overshoot of anticoagulation must be assiduously avoided. Depending on whether or not the patient has a concomitant coagulation disorder, warfarin is started on the first or second postoperative day. The anticoagulation goal for these patients is an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5 to 3.5.
- ◆ Patients are managed as per cardiac surgery routine, with a few minor edits. Cardiac surgical practice guidelines strongly suggest that postoperative patients receive beta blockade. We have generally included this, at least at low dose. The posterior Blake drain is left in until close to the time of discharge to ensure that there is no serous effusion accumulating. We generally obtain a V̇ /Q̇ scan to assess the initial result and provide a basis for follow-up. In addition, postoperative transthoracic echocardiography is performed to estimate RV systolic pressure, estimate RV and tricuspid valve function, and confirm the absence of pericardial effusion.

◆ There are a few additional features of postoperative management that should be kept in mind. If the patient has come to surgery with substantial right heart failure and peripheral edema, the diuretic plan should be appropriately adjusted to achieve diuresis for him or her to well below the preoperative weight. The usual complications of cardiac surgery may occur and are managed as usual, such as atrial fibrillation and pericarditis. Also, if despite opening all lobar and segmental arteries there is still significant pulmonary hypertension suggested by the postoperative echocardiogram, consideration may be given to starting or restarting a pulmonary vasodilator, especially if the patient was on such an agent preoperatively. If required, we generally start with sildenafil 10 mg tid and advance the dose as tolerated by blood pressure. If pulmonary hypertension persists in patients who came to surgery on riociguat (Adempas), this is often restarted. The final PA pressure result is sometimes not known until several months have passed and pulmonary microcirculation remodeling is complete.

## **Step 5. Results**

◆ The results of PTE for CTEPH are in general very good in experienced centers with an operative mortality less than 5%. An average result for PTE is a reduction in PVR of about 2/3 and a reduction in mean PAP of about 1/2.6,7 The incidence of reperfusion edema ranges from 10–40%.8 The incidence of residual pulmonary hypertension after PTE approximates 30% but does not seem to effect long-term survival.9 Six-minute walk test and New York Heart Association functional class improve after PTE.7,8 The 5-year survival rate after PTE is about 80%.6

## **Step 6. Pearls and Pitfalls**

- ◆ Make sure the diagnosis of CTEPH is correct.
- ◆ Starting the proper dissection plane is crucial and the most important step in ensuring a good outcome. Since it is done during cooling or during reperfusion there is no rush to get the proper plane and the surgeon should be certain the correct plane is achieved before beginning distal dissection and proceeding with circulatory arrest.
- ◆ Gentle traction must be maintained on the specimen and the dissecting sucker does all the work pushing/separating the wall of the PA off the specimen. If traction is too firm the specimen will break and disease will be left behind. If traction is too gentle, progress will be too slow risking prolonged circulatory arrest times.
- ◆ Once all the segmental branches have been cleared the surgeon should check each segment one last time to make sure all visible scar is removed.
- ◆ Very occasionally it is helpful to go lateral to the SVC to access the distal right PA if the patient's anatomy prohibits adequate visualization medial to the SVC.
- ◆ Tilting the heart up before dissecting the left PA can provide better access to the distal artery at times and a trial and error approach should be used to adjust retraction to provide the best view of the distal left PA.
- ◆ All patients require extensive diuresis postoperatively to reduce pulmonary edema and reduce preoperative water retention from preoperative right heart failure.
