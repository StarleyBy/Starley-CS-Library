## **Section I Cardiac Transplantation in Adults without Congenital Heart Disease**

## DEFINITION

Cardiac transplantation is a therapeutic procedure whereby the heart of a suitable donor is implanted into a recipient.

## HISTORICAL NOTE

Carrel and Guthrie first reported successful heterotopic cardiac transplantation in dogs in 1905.C5 Little more was done until in 1933 Mann and colleagues at Mayo Clinic reported successful transplantation of the heart into the neck of dogs.M2 This work led to no clinical application because of lack of understanding of immunologic features of organ transplantation.

A somewhat similar history characterized development of renal transplantation. In 1908, after earlier having perfected the method for blood vessel anastomoses, Carrel reported transplantation of kidneys into experimental animals.C5 Little was done in the years after these reports, and the next work on the subject was in two reports from Dederer working in Mann's laboratory at Mayo Clinic in 1918 and 1920.D2,D3 His experiments were not successful, but Williamson later commented that Dederer's short-term success in two members of the same litter of puppies "seems very suggestive that there are biological phenomena which may be instrumental in the failures that have so frequently been attributed to mechanical difficulties."W12 In 1926, Williamson reported further studies on renal transplantation. He noted that autologous kidney transplants functioned satisfactorily for months, but that renal allografts functioned for only days.W13 Although Williamson described the histologic condition of failed renal allografts as representing a form of glomerular nephritis, he also concluded that "the failure of homogeneous kidney transplants seems attributable to a biological incompatibility between the donor and recipient."W13 He went on to state that "the value of kidney transplantation as a clinical measure is questionable with our present knowledge, although under proper conditions it might be worthy of serious consideration."W13 Work continued in Mann's laboratory, but even by 1934, Wu and Mann had not increased the understanding of failure of the transplanted kidney.W16

Twenty-two years then elapsed before report of successful transplantation of the human kidney between identical twins.H7,M10 In the interim, the work of Medawar during World War II revolutionized the understanding of transplantation. Although antigens and antibodies were to some extent understood, at least to the point that they were involved in various types of infectious disease, Medawar was the first to develop concepts of immunology applicable to transplantation. His work was a result of the British government's research program early in World War II directed toward devising new methods of skin coverage for children extensively burned by the bombings of the Battle of Britain in 1939. His first paper in 1944 described his classic experiments with skin transplants in rabbits.W12 He found that reaction of the rabbit to transplantation of skin from another rabbit was very different from the benign reaction to transplantation of its own skin from one site to another, just as Williamson and others had found in the case of the kidney. Medawar determined that the skin transplant from another rabbit developed a cellular infiltrate that destroyed the transplant in 7 to 10 days. Medawar termed this process *rejection*, and it is the analog of cellularly mediated acute rejection of cardiac transplantation as it occurs today. In the same paper, he also described second-set rejection, which occurred when later a second transplant of skin was made to the same rabbit from the same donor rabbit. This second skin graft was destroyed in 5 to 6 days, more rapidly than in first-set rejection. Medawar deduced that preformed antibodies were responsible for second-set rejection, which may be somewhat analogous to humorally mediated hyperacute rejection occurring rarely after cardiac transplantation.

In this and a second classic paper, Medawar developed a number of fundamental concepts.M8 He confirmed his deduction that rejection under some circumstances was mediated by cells (lymphocytes) and in others by humoral antibodies. He recognized that the observed phenomena were the result of enormous genetic diversity among individuals. He hypothesized that second-set rejection implied immunologic recollection of past events. Methods for preventing rejection soon began to be discussed and studied, and Medawar suggested in the early 1950s that the recently discovered corticosteroids may help prevent rejection. However, techniques of immunosuppression developed slowly, and in the interim, at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston in 1955, Merrill and colleagues performed the first successful human kidney transplant. Based on immunologic concepts developed by Medawar, they chose identical twins for this procedure.H7,M10 This successful case had been preceded at Brigham Hospital by extensive investigations and some clinical renal transplantation between genetically diverse individuals, with poor success. This work was summarized by Hume and colleagues in 1955.H18

In 1960, Merrill and colleagues reported successful transplantation with mild immunosuppression between nonidentical twins.M10 It was not until 1962 that Murray and colleagues were able to report successful "kidney transplantation in modified recipients," and in this experience are reported the beginnings of modern immunosuppressive therapy.M18 Caine and Murray showed experimentally in 1961 that azathioprine prolonged the survival of kidney transplant recipients.M18,C1

Subsequently, intensive study has considerably improved immunosuppression techniques, including development of cyclosporine and other agents.

When Shumway completed his training during the late 1950s at the University of Minnesota in the early era of cardiac surgery, he went to Stanford University and began developing an experimental program in cardiac transplantation. Lower and Shumway first reported successful experimental orthotopic cardiac transplantation in 1960, just at the time when renal transplantation was becoming established.L10 This work was confirmed by Kondo and colleagues, who also achieved prolonged survival.K16

In 1964, Hardy and colleagues performed the first heart transplant into a human, using a chimpanzee heart.H3,H5 Hardy's team had pursued laboratory investigations in cardiac transplantation for the previous 8 years.H4,H6,K20,L2,W6 They had planned to use a human donor, but the selected recipient (a 68-year-old man in shock from end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy with respiratory failure, obtundation, and a freshly amputated gangrenous leg) was too close to death to await a donor. Thus, Hardy and his team elected to use a chimpanzee donor (as a *xenotransplant*, a graft from an individual of a different species than the recipient), based on studies of chimpanzee renal transplants in humans.H5 The xenotransplanted heart contracted well on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), but was apparently too small to support the circulation unassisted. The patient died approximately 1.5 hours after discontinuation of CPB.

The first human-to-human heart transplant (allograft) was performed in Cape Town, South Africa, by Christiaan Barnard on December 3, 1967.B4 The recipient was Louis Washkansky, a 53-year-old ex-boxer with end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy. Three days after the Cape Town operation, Adran Kantrowitz performed the second human heart transplant in Brooklyn.K3 The recipient was an 18-day-old neonate with Ebstein anomaly, refractory heart failure, and previous aortopulmonary shunt for severe cyanosis. The patient received the heart of an anencephalic infant, but died 5 hours later of cardiac failure and refractory acidosis. On January 2, 1968, Barnard performed the third human heart transplant on Philip Blaiberg, a 46-year-old dental surgeon with refractory heart failure, severe coronary artery disease, and a large left ventricular aneurysm. He became the first long-term survivor, living for 18 months. Norman Shumway performed the fourth heart transplant 4 days later, and this patient died 2 weeks later. After this, other heart transplants followed rapidly in a number of institutions. By the end of 1968, cardiac transplantation had been performed in 102 patients in 50 different institutions in 17 countries. The results were generally poor, with 60% mortality by the eighth postoperative day and a mean survival of only 29 days.W6

Although cardiac transplantation was then started in yet more centers around the world, few patients were more than short-term survivors. This resulted in reduced clinical use, so by the early 1970s, cardiac transplantation had largely disappeared from clinical practice. An exception to this was the program at Stanford, where clinical and experimental transplantation continued at a steady pace and generated a continuous stream of new information. The report of Caves and colleagues describing a method of transvenous endomyocardial biopsy was an important clinical advance because it allowed monitoring cardiac allograft rejection on a serial basis.C6 As a result, in about 1980, cardiac transplantation began to reappear as a viable therapeutic modality. Another major reason for its greater success was the knowledge of immunosuppression that came from research and from experience with renal transplantation.

Cyclosporine A, introduced for immunosuppression in 1981, accelerated the evolution of cardiac transplantation from the experimental phase to a clinically useful treatment modality for patients with advanced heart failure. Cyclosporine is a fungal metabolite first isolated from *Tolypocladium inflatum Gams* in 1972.B19,B20 Its marked immunosuppressive properties were discovered by Borel in 1972.B19

Distant heart procurement programs also increased activity and improved success in cardiac transplantation. Watson and colleagues in 1977 showed the feasibility of such programs, and he and Thomas reported good clinical results using distant donors.T2,W4,W5

Since 1980, published data on more than 80,000 cardiac transplantations from over 300 cardiac transplant programs have been reported in the voluntary registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT).T1 A declining number of cardiac transplantations have been reported internationally, from a high of nearly 5000 in 1995 to less than 4000 by 2006. Cardiac transplantation in the United States has remained stable at about 2200 per year. At the same time, the number of patients on waiting lists has grown to more than 4100.

## IMMUNOLOGIC BASIS OF HEART TRANSPLANTATION

## Detection of Nonself

Biological variation between individuals occurs at the macro level, cellular level, and molecular level. Analysis of the structure of proteins and the genes that code for them indicates that some molecules can be unique to each individual. Genetically determined differences in the amino acid sequence of proteins result in alteration of their three-dimensional structure and charge; it is variation in the protein peptide components that allows the immune system to distinguish cells originating from nonself. Although individual variability may not alter a protein's function, molecules that vary in this fashion from one individual to another are said to be *polymorphic*. Protein polymorphism is not the only manner by which self can be distinguished from nonself, but it is the predominant feature that drives rejection in clinical cardiac transplantation.G9

The effector mechanisms by which cells of the immune system eliminate nonself are operative during allograft rejection and are part of the immune response that defends humans from invasion by infectious agents or toxins. Two components of the immune system, the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system, participate in responding to nonself molecules themselves.

The innate immune system includes less specific and more immediate immune responses that are not dependent on antigen receptors on T and B lymphocytes. These nonadaptive responses to nonself depend on the process of inflammation and the humoral amplification system (complement, coagulation, fibrinolytic, and kallikrein cascades). Through secretion of soluble factors (cytokines), phagocytes are attracted to sites of infection or injury, accompanied by migration of cells involved in specific immune responses.

The adaptive immune system, involving responses mediated by T lymphocytes (T cells) and B lymphocytes (B cells), requires an interval after initial exposure to nonself before destructive mechanisms are initiated.

The polymorphic self surface proteins, which form the primary basis for distinguishing nonself, are identified by lymphocytes that express (make available on the cell surface) protein molecules called *antigen receptors* that can bind to the nonself polymorphic protein peptides. These nonself peptides that are detectable by the immune system are called *antigens*. The "distinguishing feature" is at the end of the antigen receptor that is outside the cell and thus exposed to the environment. It combines with antigens, after which another portion of the molecule inside the cell initiates a series of biochemical reactions that "activate" the lymphocyte in a way that culminates in a specific immune response. T lymphocytes are the cells that can specifically detect the presence of nonself peptides through their surface antigen receptors.

Activation of B lymphocytes by nonself peptides results in the formation of *antibodies*, which are molecules specifically targeted by the organism against nonself peptides, cells, or portion of cells. In heart transplantation, this mechanism of eliminating foreign cells is the basis of humoral rejection. Antibodies can also facilitate the attachment of cytotoxic T cells on cells targeted for destruction, and serve as points of attachment for phagocytic cells, which also participate in an immune response.

## Specificity of Antigen Receptors

A unique feature of the immune system is that each T lymphocyte carries only one type of antigen receptor on its surface, and each antigen receptor is specific for a single antigen (peptide). A lymphocyte contains an average of about 100,000 antigen receptors on its surface, all identical and specific for a single antigen. Given the huge number of foreign antigens an individual may encounter, survival depends on an adequate variety (repertoire) of lymphocyte antigen receptors to combat invasion by foreign (nonself) peptides.

The actual process by which an antigen receptor identifies a bound peptide as "nonself" is mysterious. Specific receptors apparently do not discriminate between self and nonself in terms of antigen recognition, but rather, self/nonself discrimination is a function of lymphocyte populations that contain a large number of antigen receptors. During the period of immunologic development, the process of selection takes place among T cells while they develop in the thymus, in which potential harmful lymphocytes that could react with self-antigen are usually eliminated. Certain disease states develop when this process is incomplete. A small population of lymphocytes are cross-reactive, their antigen receptors binding to more than one antigen.

## Major Histocompatibility Complex Molecules

The proteins primarily involved in the immune response to organ transplantation are called *major histocompatibility complex* (MHC) antigens. T lymphocytes recognize only antigenic peptides contained within the MHC-binding groove on the surfaces of antigen-presenting cells. In each species, MHC antigens have unique names. Human MHC antigens are termed *human leukocyte antigens* (HLA). The MHC

**Figure 21-1** Simplified map of human major histocompatibility complex, class I (E, H, G, and F), II, and III. The A, B, C, and DR genes are most often routinely typed at transplant centers. Genes for tumor necrosis factor *(TNF)* and complement components can be found in the class III region. (From Kirklin and colleagues.K14)

consists of a group of genes on the short arm of chromosome 6 that code for a number of proteins expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 21-1). These genes are polymorphic in that individuals vary in the exact nucleotide sequence of the genes and therefore the specific amino acid sequence of the protein products. Therefore, for any individual MHC gene, there are likely to be multiple variations (also called *alleles*) of that gene distributed within a population of individuals.

In the context of transplantation, it is important to differentiate between donor and recipient MHC molecules. *Donor MHC molecules* are a source of antigen in that they are ingested by the *recipient antigen-presenting cells* and processed into peptides that are subsequently loaded into recipient MHC molecules for presentation to recipient T cells. The more extensive the difference in amino acid sequence between donor and recipient MHC molecules, the more likely it is that the donor MHC molecule will be broken into peptides that are recognized as nonself. In the special case of *direct antigen presentation* (see "T Lymphocytes" in later text), intact donor class II MHC molecules on donor antigen-presenting cells or donor endothelial cells within the transplanted heart may play an important role in T-cell activation.

The functions of MHC molecules are closely related to their three-dimensional structure and high degree of polymorphism. Within their three-dimensional structure, there is a distinct groove formed by two α helices that lie on top of a β-pleated sheet.B31 This groove represents the domain in which peptides are processed when they are presented to a T cell by an antigen-presenting cell. A T cell will respond only to an antigenic peptide contained in the MHC peptidebinding groove of an antigen-presenting cell. The polymorphism of the MHC molecule lies in and around the protein-binding groove, creating differences among individuals by different side grooves that may project into and out of the MHC groove for processed peptides.

The MHC complex proteins are broadly subdivided into groups called *class I, class II*, and *class III*. Class I and class II proteins are most commonly considered in the context of transplantation and have similar overall threedimensional shapes.

The human MHC class I molecules routinely typed for solid organ transplantation are called *A, B*, and *C*. Class I molecules are expressed on the surface of virtually all nucleated cells, although with varying levels of expression. The highest surface density is found on lymphocytes, with lower expression on fibroblasts, muscle cells, and endothelial cells. However, certain cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-γ can increase the level of MHC expression on these other cells. This inducibility of MHC molecules likely plays an important role in initiating and perpetuating a rejection episode. As inflammatory mediators are released during a rejection

**Figure 21-2** Schematic of a major histocompatibility (MHC) class I molecule. It consists of two polypeptide chains. The α chain has three immunoglobulin-like domains designated α1, α2, and α3. The α3 domain also serves as the binding site for the CD8 molecule. The α chain has an α-helical transmembrane portion that connects to signal transduction machinery in cell interior. Noncovalently linked to the α chain is β-microglobulin; this is required for expression of the MHC molecule on the cell surface. Key: *S–S,* Disulfide bonds. (From Kirklin and colleagues.K14)

episode, it is likely the level of MHC expression on donor vascular endothelial cells and muscle cells increases further, augmenting the antigenic stimulation.D11,E1,R10

MHC class I molecules consist of two polypeptide chains: a larger highly polymorphic α chain coded by a gene in the MHC complex on chromosome 6, and a smaller nonpolymorphic β chain called *β2-microglobulin* that is coded by a gene on chromosome 15 (Fig. 21-2). The α1 and α2 domains form a peptide-binding region in which they interact three dimensionally to form a platform of eight strands forming a β-pleated sheet flanked by two long α-helical regions forming the floor and walls of the peptide-binding groove. Within this region, peptide fragments of eight or nine amino acids present in the peptide-binding groove. The α3 domain is highly constant among class I MHC molecules, and the interaction between the α3 domain and that of β2-microglobulin helps maintain the correct confirmation of the MHC molecule for cell-surface stability. The α3 domain interacts with the CD8 molecule on the surface of T cells,G1,G5 which generally restricts the recognition of antigens displayed in the groove of class I HLA molecules to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.

The primary class II molecules related to solid organ transplantation are called *HLA-DR, HLA-DP*, and *HLA-DQ.* These molecules are composed of an α chain and a β chain, each of which contains two domains designated α1 and α<sup>2</sup> and β1 and β2, expressed as transmembrane proteins (Fig. 21-3). The α1 and α2 domains form the structure of the antigenic peptide-binding groove. The β2 domain interacts with CD4 molecules, which generally restricts the presentation of antigen in the groove of class II MHC molecules to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.

## Antigen Processing

Two basic pathways exist for the processing of antigen that subsequently is displayed on the cell surface in the

![](_page_5_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Figure 21-3** Schematic of a major histocompatibility (MHC) class II molecule composed of an α and β chain, each with two immunoglobulin-like domains designated α1, α2, and β1, β2, respectively. Majority of polymorphism in MHC class II molecules is in the β chain. The α chain is nearly invariant. Key: *S–S,* Disulfide bonds. (From Kirklin and colleagues.K14)

peptide-binding groove of a MHC molecule. The exogenous pathway involves proteins originating from outside the cell that present with MHC class II molecules (Fig. 21-4).B10,L11 This pathway is the principal vehicle for processing and presenting alloantigens following organ transplantation. It is initiated when the antigen binds to the surface of the antigenpresenting cell, which then internalizes the protein via receptor-mediated endocytosis or phagocytosis. Once the peptide (which may be either MHC class I or II) is loaded into the binding groove of the class II molecule, it is transported to the cell surface for presentation to T cells.G15 Any protein from the donor organ can serve as an antigen.

The *endogenous pathway* involves proteins that originate inside the cell, in which proteins complex with MHC class I molecules and are presented to T cells (Fig. 21-5).H10,H17 This pathway appears to have a minor role in transplant rejection, and theoretically any cell (not just antigen-presenting cells) can use it in the presentation of internal peptides on MHC class I molecules. This pathway is typically used in the body's defense against intracellular pathogens, such as viruses whose proteins can be degraded and presented on the cell surface, resulting in the cell's destruction by cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.

## T Lymphocytes

T lymphocytes represent the most important component of the immune response to transplanted organs (Box 21-1). They are defined by presence of a CD3 molecule (part of the T-cell antigen receptor) on their surface and generally

![](_page_5_Picture_11.jpeg)

**Figure 21-4** Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule synthesis and processing of exogenous antigens. An exogenous antigen can be phagocytized or endocytosed (either receptor-mediated endocytosis or pinocytosis) by an antigen-presenting cell. Once internalized, the antigen is degraded into a series of acidic compartments (including lysosomes) to produce peptides that are 13 to 18 amino acids long, which can then be situated in the peptide-binding groove of a class II MHC molecule. At the same time, newly synthesized class II molecules are assembled and associated with the invariant chain in the endoplasmic reticulum. When the complex enters the endosomal compartment, the invariant chain is degraded, leaving a fragment called *class II-associated invariant chain peptide* (CLIP) that occupies the peptide-binding groove of the class II molecule. The class II-like molecule HLA-DM catalyzes release of CLIP and loading of the antigenic peptide into the peptide-binding groove of the class II molecule. (From Kirklin and colleagues.K14)

**Figure 21-5** Synthesis of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and processing of endogenous antigens. Class I molecules are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum with calnexin, a membrane-bound protein. β<sup>2</sup> Microglobulin is then substituted for calnexin, and the class I molecule binds to the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). Proteins in the cytoplasm are degraded to peptides by proteasomes. Peptides are transported into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum by the TAP, and a peptide is loaded into the peptide-binding groove of the class I molecule. Molecule is then released from the TAP and exported to the cell surface via the Golgi complex. (From Kirklin and colleagues.K14)

#### **Box 21-1** T-Cell Facts

- The thymus is required for T-cell development.
- When mature, all T cells express CD3 surface molecules.
- Peripheral T cells express CD4 or CD8 molecules, but not both.
- CD4 and CD8 surface markers identify T-cell populations with different immunologic capabilities.
- T cells regulate antiviral and antifungal cellular immune responses.
- T cells regulate activation and differentiation of B cells and switching of antibody secretion from IgM to other classes.

with either CD4 or CD8 surface molecules. The two basic subtypes of T lymphocytes are *T helper (TH) cells* and *cytotoxic T cells.* The TH lymphocyte expresses CD4 molecules on its surface and functions primarily to detect nonself antigens by means of its T-cell receptors. When activated, it can also recruit other cells (CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, other CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, B cells, phagocytes, neutrophils, and other inflammatory cells) into the immune response (Table 21-1).

*Cytotoxic T lymphocytes* differ from TH cells in that they express CD8 molecules on their surface. The cytotoxic T lymphocyte functions primarily as an effector cell that kills target cells (cells that express nonself antigens in the groove of a class I MHC molecule), and under special circumstances may suppress other cells (prevent their activation). The T-cell receptor allows the T lymphocyte to detect the presence of a nonself antigen by providing the capability of binding to antigen and MHC molecules in a specific manner. This receptor allows detection of nonself MHC antigens in the transplanted heart. Each T-lymphocyte clone has a T-cell receptor that is unique with respect to the receptors of other T-cell clones and has a unique T-cell genetic sequence. The pool of unique T cells constitutes the *T-cell*

*repertoire*, which includes more than 1012 unique T-cell receptors in a given individual.

The portion of the T-cell receptor that interacts with the antigenic peptide–MHC complex is a heterodimer of two covalently linked polypeptide chains designated α and β (Fig. 21-6). The α and β chains each have a variable region (V-region) that contains a highly variable amino acid sequence.

**Figure 21-6** Schematic of T-cell receptor (TCR). The TCR is a multichain complex consisting of a heterodimer that, in the majority of T cells, consists of an α and β chain, each of which has immunoglobulin-like domains, as indicated by the loops held together by disulfide *(S-S)* bonds. These chains constitute the portion of the molecule that binds the antigen–major histocompatibility complex on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell. The α and β chains are noncovalently linked to the CD3 complex, which consists of chains called *γ*, *δ*, and *ε*. The two additional chains can be either of two pairs composed of two ζ chains, or of a ζ chain and a η chain. The CD3 complex transmits a signal through the plasma membrane *(shaded in gray)* into the interior of the cell. (From Kirklin and colleagues.K14)

![](_page_7_Picture_3.jpeg)

The α and β chains are associated with membrane-bound proteins called the *CD3 complex.* It is required for expression of T-cell receptor on the cell surface and is responsible for transduction of a membrane signal when the T-cell receptor complex interacts with antigen. Ability of a lymphocyte to respond to the presence of a specific antigen is termed *recognition.*

T cells recognize antigen only in the presence of self-MHC. TH cells, which initiate the cellular response to transplant antigens, respond to antigen that is associated with an MHC complex on the cell surface through a process called *antigen presentation.* This process is limited to certain cell types called *antigen-presenting cells*. A presenting antigen must first be internalized within the antigen-presenting cell, broken down into 7 to 13 amino acid polypeptides, which are physically associated with MHC molecules, and exported to the cell surface as a complex. TH cells respond only to those cells that express class II molecules on their surface. Cytotoxic T cells (CD8<sup>+</sup> ) respond to cells that have class I MHC molecules on their surface.

## Antigen-Presenting Cells

Because cytotoxic T cells recognize antigens only on the surface of other cells that have class I MHC surface molecules, a functionally distinct class of cells has been identified that presents antigen to T lymphocytes. These antigenpresenting cells process antigens by breaking them down into individual peptides, inserting the peptides into the MHC molecule, and transporting them to the cell surface (Box 21-2). Cells that function as antigen-presenting cells are dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. Dendritic cells are the most efficient antigen-presenting cells because they have a large surface area, increasing the probability of contact with T lymphocytes. Dendritic cells are present throughout most lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues and possess a high density of surface MHC class II molecules. Antigen-presenting cells also provide a *second signal* that is necessary for T-cell activation, which is the binding of another molecule on the surface of the T cell in addition to the binding of the T-cell receptor by an antigen-MHC complex.

## **Box 21-2** Antigen-Presenting Cells

- Derived from bone marrow
- Process peptides and present antigen to T cells
- Transport foreign antigens to lymph nodes for interaction with T cells
- Express adhesion molecules that facilitate T-cell receptor
- binding to the peptide/major histocompatibility complex ● Provide co-stimulatory "second signals" to activate the T cell

From Kirklin and colleagues.K14

## B Lymphocytes

B lymphocytes arise from bone marrow and do not express CD4 or CD8 molecules on their surface. They use surface immunoglobulins rather than T-cell receptors for detecting antigen, and the end product of B-cell activation is differentiation into antibody-secreting *plasma cells* and *memory B cells* (B cells capable of generating an immune response when there is subsequent exposure to the same antigen). Immunoglobulins (antibodies) are produced by B cells that have differentiated into plasma cells. They consist of four polypeptide chains in two pairs, each consisting of a heavy chain and a shorter light chain (Fig. 21-7). The end of the molecule is called a *variable region* because the genes that code for the heavy and light chains are composed of segments that join together imprecisely. The other end of the heavy chain, called the *constant region*, contains sites for biologically important activity such as complement activation. The heavy chain constant regions form the basis for classifying immunoglobulins into isotypes IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE.

#### Natural Killer Cells

Natural killer (NK) cells are structurally similar to T and B lymphocytes, but are not antigen specific and do not express either a T-cell receptor or immunoglobulin.K2 These cells are called *natural killer cells* based on their ability to spontaneously lyse tumor cells in vitro. In vivo, they can lyse target

![](_page_8_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 21-7** Schematic of structure of an immunoglobulin molecule. An individual antibody molecule consists of two heavy and two light chains. Each heavy and light chain combines to form a single antigen-binding region for a total of two antigenic binding sites. Both chains contain a series of sequence motifs about 100 amino acids long that can fold into globular forms called *immunoglobulin domains*. The two constant region domains in each heavy chain that are farthest from the variable domains constitute the Fc receptor and complement-binding portions of the molecule. Variable domains constitute the antigen-binding site. (From Kirklin and colleagues.K14)

cells without the requirement for prior immunization. They can lyse cell targets that lack surface expression of MHC molecules. NK cells represent about 15% of peripheral lymphoid cells.

## Cytokines

Soluble molecules called *cytokines* play an important role in the immune response by stimulating secretion of proteins that alter the behavior or property of cells and facilitate recruitment of immunologic cells from distant locations. Unlike hormones, cytokines generally act locally and are not usually found in circulation in large quantities because of their short half-life. Although numerous cytokines have been identified that have diverse biological actions (Table 21-2), cytokines in transplantation are particularly important in mediating inflammatory processes and regulating T-cell responses. Cytokine production is one of the hallmarks of T-cell activation. Prominent cytokines in the immunologic response to transplantation include interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and IFN-γ.

## Adhesion Molecules

Adhesion molecules are proteins formed within cells and secreted into the environment of these cells. They function to maintain structural integrity and position of body cells and promote adhesion of leukocytes to surrounding structures. Adhesion molecules include integrins (adhesion molecules that maintain cells in position by attaching one end of the integrin to the cytoskeleton of the cell and the other end to molecules of the extracellular matrix), selectins (adhesion molecules that mediate rolling of leukocytes along the vascular endothelium), and Ig superfamily adhesion molecules. Adhesion molecules mediate the initial interaction of T cells with antigens, their migration, and their retention within a transplanted organ.

## Activation of Immune System Following Cardiac Transplantation

The inciting event is placing the donor heart into the recipient and perfusing it with native blood elements following aortic clamp removal. Within minutes, large quantities of donor cells, protein (some of which is soluble MHC molecules), and cellular fragments are carried to the spleen and lymph nodes, which are highly efficient in filtering antigen and trapping antigen within resident antigen-presenting cells. These cells enter the paracortex of the lymph node, which is populated by T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. If the T cells have a receptor capable of binding to MHC molecules containing a particular peptide, they will be activated, after which they interact with B cells, inducing the initial stages of B-cell activation. In addition, donor antigenpresenting cells migrate from the heart and encounter T cells as they circulate through the lymphoid tissues. Donor antigen-presenting cells also line the endothelial surfaces of the donor heart vasculature. Donor alloantigens containing foreign MHC complex molecules can be presented to the recipient T cells in two ways: directly and indirectly (Table 21-3). Direct recognition of donor antigens by T lymphocytes involves direct engagement between the recipient T-cell receptor and the donor antigen-presenting cell (also called *passenger lymphocytes*). Even though these antigenpresenting cells are nonself, the structural similarities are sufficient to allow binding with either helper or cytotoxic T lymphocytes, because both MHC class I and II molecules will be expressed. In this method of donor antigen presentation, the specific antigen presented in the groove of the complex is often unimportant because the donor antigenpresenting cell will be identified as nonself.

When shed MHC molecules from the donor organ are processed and presented by recipient antigen-presenting cells to recipient T cells, the process is termed *indirect allorecognition.* The exogenous pathway of processing and presenting alloantigens is generally operative in the indirect allorecognition process.

The presentation of donor antigen to T lymphocytes results in T-cell activation. T-cell activation occurs in concert with changes in the expression of various cell surface molecules, secretion of soluble factors, and a change in cell morphology. Once activated, the TH cell clone proliferates and releases cytokines that expand the immune response.

#### *B-Cell Activation*

B-cell activation begins with capture of antigen by immunoglobulin molecules on the B-cell surface. The antigen is then internalized, degraded, processed into peptides, and loaded into the groove of MHC class II molecules delivered to the cell surface.

When the B-cell encounters a CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell that has the appropriate T-cell antigen receptor for binding to the antigen-MHC complex on the B-cell surface, the T cells engage in a process termed *mutual activation*. P1 B-cell differentiation into immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells

requires antigen-specific signals through B-cell receptors (immunoglobulin) expressed on the cell surface and antigenspecific T-cell help in forming a co-stimulator signal and cytokine stimulation.

#### *Cellular Rejection*

Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8<sup>+</sup> ) that are specific for graft antigens play an important role in the effector phase leading to acute rejection. Like TH cells, cytotoxic T cells are not activated with a single signal, but rather require the binding of multiple surface molecules that transmit additional signals through the cell membrane. This process requires engagement by allogenic histocompatibility molecules or by an antigenic peptide MHC complex, with an additional signal via a co-stimulator molecule such as CD28. This series of signals serves to activate cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursors that then proliferate and differentiate into cytotoxic T lymphocytes in response to IL-2. Once a cytotoxic T lymphocyte receives the appropriate signals, it can administer a lethal hit to a target cell that results in cell death either through exocytosis (release of destructive granules into the target cell) or induction of apoptosis.

## **Humoral Rejection**

Humoral rejection refers to production of antibodies or activation of complement in response to exposure to an alloantigen. B lymphocytes mediate the response, and antibodies can react with antigens in solution or on the cell surface. Antibodies associated with humoral rejection are generally IgM and IgG. Effector mechanisms associated with humoral responses include neutralization (blocking of relative sites or binding of receptors on a target cell), opsonization (antibodies acting as a "tag" that can be recognized by phagocytic cells), and complement activation. The most extreme form of humoral rejection is hyperacute rejection, mediated by preexisting antibodies that, upon entry into the donor heart vasculature following aortic clamp removal, rapidly bind to the vascular endothelium. These antibodies fix complement, which causes direct lyses of endothelial cells, and elaboration of complement components induces a massive infiltration of granulocytes. The subsequent massive cell necrosis and tissue swelling can lead to organ destruction within minutes.

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

## Recipient Evaluation and Selection

The general approach to patients referred for possible cardiac transplantation is listed in Box 21-3. If patients were selected primarily on the basis of highest expected posttransplant survival and quality of life at 1, 5, and 10 years, transplantation would be recommended for less ill patients whose survival is acceptable with medical or nontransplant surgical therapy. Alternatively, if transplantation were reserved only for patients closest to death from end-stage heart disease, the associated noncardiac organ dysfunction would drastically reduce patient and graft survival, compromising effective use of organs. Thus, some balance must be achieved between survival benefit to the recipient and maximal use of donor organs (in terms of organ survival).

Because of ongoing controversies, experts in the field have periodically convened to promote standardization of selection criteria. C16,M17,O1 There is general consensus that the prognosis for survival and quality of life of patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV heart failure

## **Box 21-3** Approach to Potential Candidate for Heart Transplantation

- Address potentially reversible causes and components of heart failure
- Evaluate severity of heart failure and functional capacity
- Tailor medical therapy to improve symptoms and reduce mortality
- Assess risks of deterioration or sudden death
- Identify indications for transplantation
- Exclude contraindications to transplantation
- If heart transplantation is recommended, continue heart failure management with periodic reevaluation

symptoms who do not improve with medical or surgical therapy are sufficiently poor that transplant should be considered. The major dilemma in decision making involves patients who are converted from class IV to class III/II by appropriate medical therapy. The decision-making process for this large group of patients is critically important because (1) the available supply of organs is inadequate to provide even a small fraction with transplantation, (2) allocation of a donor heart to a patient with a relatively better prognosis would deprive a more seriously ill patient with a short life expectancy (but preserved noncardiac organ function) the opportunity for transplantation at a time when his or her benefit would still be maximal, and (3) cardiac transplantation is not curative, is associated with its own chronic morbidity and survival limitation, and should therefore not be offered to patients with intermediate- or long-term survival approaching that of transplantation.

Identifying factors that predict mortality in ambulatory patients with advanced heart failure has been hampered by the complexity and variability of the heart failure syndrome, evolving nature of medical treatment for heart failure, retrospective nature of most studies, infrequent application of appropriate multivariable analysis, and almost uniform lack of patient-specific predictive models. Nevertheless, numerous risk factors<sup>B27</sup> have been identified (but poorly quantified) that are associated with adverse outcome in ambulatory patients with advanced heart failure (Box 21-4). Despite many clinical studies of heart failure, few variables *consistently* predict duration of survival (or freedom from rapid deterioration) in advanced heart failure patients undergoing transplant.

## *Evaluation of Comorbid Conditions*

Noncardiac comorbidity may adversely affect longevity or quality of life after transplantation, independent of, or as a complex interaction with, graft function (Box 21-5). Of particular interest is the effect of chronic immunosuppression on natural history of these comorbid conditions. For many such conditions, there is a paucity of secure information upon which to base rational decisions about so-called relative contraindications, owing to the small numbers of patients available for analysis and reluctance to allocate a limited resource to those whose comorbid conditions constitute a major part of their disease complex. The general contraindications to heart transplantation are listed in Box 21-6.

**Age** In the absence of other life-limiting noncardiac conditions, the appropriate upper age limit becomes an ethical rather than medical decision. In properly selected patients, recipients older than age 60 years have a survival similar to younger patients.B8 Nonetheless, some programs limit heart transplantation to patients younger than age 65. Older patients may be selected if their noncardiac organ systems are normal, their cognitive function is totally intact, they have a strong will to live, their family support system is well developed, and they have the potential for good quality of life if normal cardiac function is restored. A few programs have addressed this issue by allocating only older donor hearts (>50 years) to elderly recipients.

Transplantation may also be advisable as combined heart–kidney transplant. *a* May be relative or absolute, depending on severity or program philosophy.

*<sup>d</sup>*These apply only if the increased resistance is largely nonreactive (fixed). Requires liver biopsy to exclude cirrhosis or other intrinsic liver disease. Key: *FEV1,* Forced expiratory volume in 1 second; *FVC,* forced vital capacity.

**Pulmonary Vascular Resistance** The critical feature of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (Rp) is pulmonary systolic pressure at completion of CPB during the transplant operation. The donor right ventricle generally poorly tolerates a systolic afterload of more than about 50 mmHg, and overt right ventricular dysfunction usually occurs above a pressure of 55 to 60 mmHg, potentially resulting in acute right ventricular failure and death. Tolerance of the donor right ventricle to elevated afterload conditions (secondary to increased Rp) is partly a function of donor right ventricular reserves, ischemic/reperfusion injury, and possibly donor/ recipient size ratio.

The majority of adult patients with advanced heart failure secondary to ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy have a reactive component of elevated Rp that is directly responsive to left atrial (or pulmonary capillary wedge) pressure. When elevated Rp is primarily reactive, it falls rapidly after transplantation. If the donor heart left atrial pressure is normal, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, transpulmonary gradient, and Rp return to near-normal levels within 1 week of transplant, with little further change during the coming year.B25

It is generally recognized that operative risk progressively increases as Rp rises. Other risk factors interact with Rp to create a higher or lower risk for a given level of resistance. In general terms, an Rp greater than about 5 Wood units (WU) or a transpulmonary gradient (mean pulmonary artery pressure minus pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) above 14 mmHg that is unresponsive to pulmonary vasodilators and inotropic agents (used to test reversibility of pulmonary vascular hypertension) is a major contraindication to orthotopic cardiac transplantation.B25 To define the reactive component of any elevation of pulmonary resistance, a standard part of the cardiac transplant evaluation is right heart catheterization to document cardiac and pulmonary pressures (and Rp).C10 If Rp is elevated, a sustained favorable hemodynamic response (Rp < about 4 WU) to pulmonary vasodilator therapy (e.g., milrinone, prostaglandin E1, nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, nitric oxide) suggests a suitable risk for cardiac transplantation.

When Rp remains elevated and medical therapy (sometimes over days to several weeks on continuous intravenous [IV] infusions) fails to reduce pulmonary artery systolic pressure below about 60 mmHg, secure conclusions about pulmonary reactivity cannot be made. In that instance, implanting a left ventricular assist device may be warranted to force reduction of left atrial pressure and promote reversal of the reactive component.

**Renal Dysfunction** Multiple studies have shown that preexisting renal dysfunction is a major risk factor for mortality after cardiac transplantation. A serum creatinine level of 2 mg·dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and a creatinine clearance of less than 50 mL·min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> portend a worse prognosis in adults following cardiac transplantation, particularly because of the necessity for cyclosporine or tacrolimus immunosuppression, with their associated nephrotoxic effects. A major dilemma often exists in estimating the likelihood that renal dysfunction is secondary to severe low cardiac output and aggressive diuretic therapy, or whether it is secondary to intrinsic renal disease. There is no specific level of serum creatinine or creatinine clearance that differentiates between these.

Effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), obtained by nuclear medicine techniques, is a useful adjunct to creatinine clearance. An ERPF of less than 200 mL·min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> generally indicates important underlying intrinsic renal disease affecting the distribution of renal blood flow and likely represents a major risk factor for cardiac transplantation.

**Infection** Presence of active infection is a traditional absolute contraindication to cardiac transplantation if the infection is life threatening and not readily reversible with antibiotic therapy. Clearly, transplantation would be ill advised in the presence of an important pneumonia, central nervous system (CNS) infection, intraabdominal sepsis, or active bloodstream septicemia, because the likelihood of these infectious conditions progressing to a life-threatening state following the immunosuppression of transplantation would be high. However, certain infections, such as mediastinitis following implantation of a ventricular assist device, driveline infections, or in some cases, partially treated endocarditis,B29 are consistent with good outcome following cardiac transplantation, albeit at a higher risk of posttransplant mediastinal infection and fatality.

**Prior Malignancy** All patients should be screened appropriately for malignancies by a chest radiograph, mammogram, prostate-specific antigen, abdominal ultrasound, and complete physical examination. A history of malignancy increases the risk of a subsequent fatal malignancy following cardiac transplantation.H17 However, if there is no evidence of residual, recurrent, or metastatic disease for a sufficient period to consider the malignancy cured, cardiac transplantation should be considered. Although the suitable period differs among malignancies, in general, a malignancy-free interval of 5 years is considered long enough to proceed with transplantation. Rarely, patients with cardiac neoplasms may undergo successful transplantation if there is no evidence of metastases or extension of the cancer beyond the surgical resection areas necessary for transplantation (see Chapter 18). This is, however, a contentious subject because malignant cardiac neoplasms can metastasize during the waiting period for organ allocation.

Squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma of the skin represents a curable condition with a low probability of metastasis if completely excised. Thus, this malignancy, if completely excised, does not require an extended wait prior to cardiac transplantation.

## Donor Evaluation and Selection

The donor becomes available when brain death has occurred, and criteria enumerated by the Ad Hoc Committee of the Harvard Medical School are generally used.A6,C4 The donor must be completely unresponsive, without reflexes or movements of breathing. Two flat electroencephalograms obtained 24 hours apart are sometimes required.

Once a potential donor has been identified, other criteria apply. The donor should be younger than about age 60 years (although occasionally hearts from older donors are used for elderly recipients) and without documented prior myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography is recommended in all potential donors older than age 45 years; the heart is generally not used for transplantation if there is important arteriosclerotic coronary obstruction. A history of smoking also prompts coronary angiography as part of the process of donor selection.

There should have been no prolonged episodes of profound hypotension or cardiac arrest after injury, because poor donor heart function after transplantation is likely to follow such an event. However, echocardiography often allows the heart to be used if ventricular performance is good. Important ventricular arrhythmias usually eliminate a donor.

Two-dimensional transthoracic or, occasionally, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is performed to evaluate cardiac morphology, ventricular performance, and cardiac valve function. The heart should have good contraction and be free of any segmental wall motion abnormalities. Global or regional hypokinesis and valvar heart disease preclude use of the heart. Severe left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac contusion with wall motion abnormality disqualify the donor. Minor cardiac malformations such as patent foramen ovale or a small ventricular septal defect may be corrected and the heart used.

Any evidence of sepsis must be sought, and if found, the heart is rejected. Hearts from donors who are positive for human immunodeficiency virus are not used. Hearts from donors who test positive for hepatitis C are not used unless the recipient is also positive. Active malignancy in the donor disqualifies use of the heart for transplantation except in cases of primary malignant brain tumor. Death resulting from carbon monoxide poisoning, with a carboxyhemoglobin level greater than 20%, eliminates the donor heart from use. History of IV drug abuse usually disqualifies the donor, but occasionally exceptions are made. There should not be a great disparity between size of donor and recipient, although donor hearts from males of about 75 kg or greater are usually suitable for larger recipients up to about 110 kg.

Findings on physical examination relative to the heart should be normal, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram is examined to exclude the possibility of preexisting Q-wave abnormalities and conduction defects. Nonspecific ST- and T-wave changes may be caused by head injury, hypothermia, and vasopressor agent, and do not per se contraindicate use of the heart. If there is any suggestion of hypotension or cardiac injury, serum cardiac enzymes are obtained and should be normal or at most mildly elevated.

Once this screening has been performed and the heart found acceptable, managing the donor becomes intense. Hypotension, hypothermia, and diabetes insipidus are frequent physiologic results of brain death and make careful attention to volume replacement essential, but excessive crystalloid infusion can produce right ventricular distension and lung damage from extravascular water. Active warming may be required to counteract hypothermia.

The decision to use a specific donor is based in part on the feasibility of keeping cardiac ischemic time to less than about 6 hours, because prolonged ischemic time is a risk factor for acute graft dysfunction.

#### *Effect of Brain Death on Myocardial Function*

The effect of brain death on the myocardium has been of considerable interest for two important reasons: (1) there is a low but important prevalence of primary graft failure following cardiac transplantation, and (2) many potential donor hearts are not used because of donor heart dysfunction. Successful strategies to improve dysfunctional donor hearts would increase the number of hearts available for transplantation.

Myocardial injury by catecholamine infusion and stress stimulation of the nervous system are central to understanding donor heart dysfunction. Epinephrine infusion can cause cardiac hypertrophy, and experimental catecholamine infusion produces a characteristic histologic appearance of myofibrillar degeneration, also known as *contraction band necrosis*. Its histologic features are distinct from coagulation necrosis, the predominant histologic pattern seen in acute myocardial infarction.B7 In coagulation necrosis, myocardial cells die without obvious contraction bands, calcification appears late, and a predominant polymorphonuclear cell response occurs. Coagulation necrosis is not seen histologically for many hours or even days after the onset of the infarction. In contrast, myofibrillar degeneration is histologically detectable early after onset, and the myofibers die in a hypercontracted state with obvious contraction bands.B17,M4,S2 This lesion can also be seen in humans when the mode of death involves considerable stress, such as physical assault in which death occurred from the assault but not from lifethreatening injuries. This suggests an association between catecholamine release and myofibrillar degeneration.C7 Experimental intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhages can also produce these myocardial lesions.S2

Brain death is frequently accompanied by massive release of endogenous catecholamines.B9,N7,R11 In animal models, blood epinephrine and norepinephrine levels may increase 100- to 500-fold within 10 seconds of experimental brain injury,R11 with a correlation between magnitude of catecholamine release and severity of injury.B9,R11 In humans, catecholamine levels after brain death have been highly variable,P8 likely related to individual variability in neurohumoral response and the mechanism and rapidity of the catastrophic intracranial event. In Novitsky's baboon model, rapid increase in intracranial pressure was accompanied by marked increases in mean arterial, pulmonary wedge, and central venous pressure within 15 minutes, and by a threefold to sevenfold increase in blood norepinephrine and epinephrine levels.N7 A relationship between noradrenaline levels and increases in the plasma level of creatine kinase (CK)-MB has been demonstrated after acute head injury in man.C23

The physiologic response to this post–brain death catecholamine storm may result from the interplay between coronary vasoconstriction and reperfusion in association with oxygen-derived free-radical generation. Oxidation products of catecholamines may induce myocardial injury,B15 probably resulting from peroxidation of membrane phospholipids. Catecholamine storm may also induce myocardial injury by oxygen-derived free radicals generated by reperfusion of myocardium that has been rendered ischemic by severe coronary vasoconstriction.

## Immunologic Aspects of Transplant Testing

## *ABO Compatibility*

The ABO blood group antigens are carbohydrate structures carried on glycoprotein and glycolipid components of cell surfaces and tissues throughout the body, most notably on the surface of erythrocytes. In the human heart, blood group antigens are confined to the vascular endothelium and mesothelial cells on the surface of the epicardium. In individuals who lack one or more of the ABO antigens, natural antibodies against the absent antigen appear during the first 6 months of life and are present permanently thereafter.

An accepted requirement for successful cardiac transplantation is identical or compatible blood groups between donor and recipient. If an allograft containing A or B blood antigens on its endothelial surfaces is transplanted into a recipient who has naturally occurring anti-A or anti-B antibody, hyperacute rejection or accelerated aggressive acute rejection will likely occur. When a donor and recipient display ABO incompatibility, circulating antidonor hemagglutinins rapidly bind to endothelial cells and promote platelet deposition, granulocyte activation, and thrombosis, resulting in hyperacute rejection. Although transplantation in the presence of ABO incompatibility (donor heart A into recipient blood group B or O, B into A or O, AB into A, B, or O) would be expected to produce universal hyperacute rejection, there are notable exceptions (see also "ABO-Incompatible Infant Heart Transplantation" in Section II). Considerable variability exists among individuals in the level of blood group antigen expression in tissues, such as on cardiac endothelium.

A specific exception to ABO incompatibility may be donors of A2 blood group. Blood group A contains subgroups A1 and A2. Subgroup A1 acts like blood group A in its propensity for producing hyperacute rejection when transplanted into an ABO-incompatible recipient. However, donor subgroup A2 may be less prone to producing hyperacute rejection because the A2 antigen is not readily displayed on the endothelial surfaces of the heart. Skin grafts from A2 donors are not hyperacutely rejected when transplanted into B or O recipients.H7 A clinical trial of A2 kidneys transplanted into O recipients produced graft outcome similar to ABOcompatible transplants.B29,B32 The mechanism may relate in part to the two different galactosaminyltransferases produced by A1 and A2 genes,S4 resulting in a qualitative difference in the type of core saccharide-based A antigens.

## *Tissue Typing*

HLA antigens play a central role in the immune response, and the HLA genes are the most polymorphic known in the human genome. *Haplotype* refers to the set of genes on any one chromosome. Every individual has two haplotypes (one from each parent) for the genes on the short arm of chromosome 6 that code for the MHC complex. Each haplotype contains antigens determined by the HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DR, and other loci. The two haplotypes for an individual make up the HLA phenotype, which is the complete list of HLA antigens possessed by that individual. Studies of kidney graft survival have demonstrated a substantial survival benefit when the HLA antigens are matched between donor and recipient.D8-D10 Some benefit in freedom from rejection has also been demonstrated for heart transplantation related to the number of HLA mismatches.

Some studies suggest a higher probability of rejection with HLA-DRD6,F2,J1,K4 and HLA-DQ mismatching in heart transplantation.D10,F1 However, because of the time limitations imposed by the current state of cardiac preservation during organ procurement and the scarcity of organs, donor hearts are currently not selected on the basis of prospective histocompatibility testing.

## *Panel Reactive Antibodies*

In addition to HLA typing, the transplantation evaluation process includes routine examination of serum from a prospective transplant recipient for presence of circulating anti-HLA antibodies, also called *humoral sensitization*. Sensitization is established by documenting the presence of circulating anti-HLA antibodies by the panel reactive antibody (PRA) test. The most common cause of sensitization is pregnancy.S9 Other common causes include prior blood transfusion, prior transplantation, or insertion of a ventricular assist device. Occasionally a patient will demonstrate a positive PRA with anti-HLA antibodies and no obvious sensitizing event. These antibodies may represent cross-reactivity between bacterial or viral epitopes and HLA antigens.

## *Crossmatching*

The crossmatch at transplantation is typically the final test of immunologic compatibility between donor and recipient prior to making the decision to transplant. The goal of the crossmatch is to prevent hyperacute rejection and accelerated severe acute rejection during the first 5 to 7 days after transplantation. The crossmatch tests the reactivity of recipient sera (with its potential anti-HLA antibodies) against donor lymphocytes obtained from peripheral blood or lymph node. With current crossmatch techniques, hyperacute rejection is extremely rare. ln practice, a pretransplant *prospective crossmatch* is often omitted when a recent PRA is 0% because of the very low probability of hyperacute or accelerated acute rejection in that setting and because of the additional time prior to transplantation needed to obtain a crossmatch. In that instance a *retrospective crossmatch* is usually obtained in the hours following transplantation to make a final determination of the presence of antidonor antibodies.

A positive complement-dependent lymphocytotoxic T-cell and B-cell crossmatch is a strong predictor of hyperacute or severe accelerated acute rejection. However, presence of a negative cytotoxic crossmatch does not guarantee protection against hyperacute or severe early rejection. It has been hypothesized that minimal clonal expansion of TH1 and TH2 subsets of T cells plus B cells is sufficient to produce a brief IgM (or IgM followed by IgG) response that is promptly down-regulated, and detectable levels of IgG may not be present (thus producing a negative crossmatch).N5,S7,S8 However, with sustained stimulation following transplantation, B-cell clones expand and express increased affinity for the HLA antigen. Substantial clonal expansion then occurs with TH1, TH2, and B-cell proliferation and the production of antibody. Serum anti-HLA antibodies become predominantly IgG with sustained levels, and further antibody response is readily inducible with reexposure to even small amounts of these HLA antigens.E3

#### *Virtual Crossmatch*

With the current precision of flow cytometry technology in identifying circulating anti-HLA antibodies in potential recipients, many transplant centers omit formal crossmatching (with the considerable time requirement) in the presence of low PRAs, and rely instead on a comparison of HLA typing of the donor with identified anti-HLA antibodies in the recipient. If there are no donor antigens against which recipient antibodies are likely to react, it is generally safe to proceed with transplantation.

## TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

## Donor Heart Procurement

Most donors are donating multiple organs including the heart. Therefore, the donor is prepared from neck to midthigh. Preferably, a central venous line and an arterial catheter are placed because marked hypotension may occur while mobilizing the abdominal organs.

A long midline incision is made from jugular notch to pubis. Volume replacement continues as needed because considerable bleeding from incisions is frequent as a result of the donor's vasodilated state. After median sternotomy, a self-retaining retractor is inserted. While other organ procurement teams proceed, the pericardium is opened and usual stay sutures applied. The heart is examined for evidence of cardiac injury, congenital anomalies, coronary arteriosclerosis, or other acquired heart disease. The ascending aorta is dissected and mobilized as far as the brachiocephalic takeoff. The superior vena cava (SVC) is completely mobilized, including any pericardial reflection onto it. A pursestring suture is placed on the ascending aorta for cardioplegia infusion.

When cardiectomy is ready to begin, 200 units· kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> of heparin are given, and the cardioplegia needle is inserted into the ascending aorta and secured. In this setting, the cardioplegic solution is infused by gravity. Cold University of Wisconsin (UW) solution is commonly used as the myocardial preservation solution, but other intracellular- or extracellulartype solutions provide effective preservation.

If a central line is in place, it is withdrawn. The SVC is clamped and later divided as far distally as possible. The right or left superior pulmonary vein (or left atrium above the entrance of the left pulmonary veins if lung procurement is planned) is partially divided to permit escape of blood from the heart (Fig. 21-8). If lungs are also being harvested, the left atrium is incised for egress of pulmonary preservation solution, and later a cuff of left atrium is left around the right and left pulmonary veins for the lung allografts. The inferior vena cava (IVC) is divided, leaving part of it with the liver. After several cardiac ejections to completely empty the heart, the aorta is occluded just proximal to the brachiocephalic artery. Infusion of the cardioplegic solution is begun. Cardioplegic infusion pressure is monitored digitally while 1 to 2 L of solution is infused. Ice-cold saline or slush solution is poured into the pericardium.

Coronary sinus effluent is allowed to escape into the pericardial sac through the open IVC. Cardiectomy proceeds by dividing the right pulmonary veins at the pericardial reflection. The heart is retracted superiorly and to the right to expose the left pulmonary veins (Fig. 21-8, *B*), which are divided at the pericardial reflection. Downward traction alongside the aorta and pulmonary trunk exposes the maximal length of these vessels. The aorta is divided distal to the origin of the brachiocephalic artery (Fig. 21-8, *C*). The left pulmonary artery is divided at the pericardial reflection. The right pulmonary artery is divided. All that remains to be divided is connective tissue behind the left atrium at the pericardial reflection and lymphatic tissue, which lies between the left atrium and the tracheal bifurcation.

The heart is removed from the body and immersed in cold preservation solution. A few minutes are spent to trim the heart and prepare it for implantation. The right pulmonary veins are joined by incision, as are left pulmonary veins. The left atrium is opened posteriorly between the pulmonary veins to provide maximum length for the left atrial suture line. The aorta is separated from the pulmonary trunk. The pulmonary trunk is opened at its bifurcation to preserve maximum circumference that may be needed to match a dilated recipient vessel. The cardiac chambers are thoroughly irrigated with cold isotonic solution and inspected to ensure absence of debris or anatomic anomalies. The organ is placed in triple sterile plastic bags filled with preservation solution and transferred to an ice chest for transport.

## Orthotopic Cardiac Transplantation

#### *Biatrial Technique*

In addition to the usual preparations for cardiac operations (see Chapters 2, 3, and 4), a large-gauge triple-lumen catheter is placed through the left internal jugular vein after anesthesia induction. The right internal jugular vein is left undisturbed if possible to preserve it as access for future endomyocardial biopsies. After endotracheal intubation, a TEE probe is placed for later monitoring during de-airing maneuvers and for assessing ventricular function. The heart is exposed through a median sternotomy. In the presence of previous cardiac operations, femoral artery and vein catheters are inserted percutaneously in case acute cardiac decompensation requires insertion of an intraaortic balloon pump or emergency institution of CPB.

When arrival of the donor heart is imminent, CPB is established with separate caval cannulation. Additional time is allotted if extensive dissection is necessary. The aorta is clamped and the caval tapes secured. The right atrium is incised just above the level of the entrance of the IVC, anterior to the sulcus terminalis. The incision is carried around to the IVC, leaving the cava below the cut surface of the right atrium. The interatrial septum is incised and carried superiorly until it meets the roof of the left atrium. The left atrial incision is then carried leftward, leaving a generous cuff of left atrium above the entrance of the left pulmonary veins. A cardiotomy sump is placed into the left atrium when the interatrial septum is incised, and the great arteries are divided proximally to expose the underlying left atrium. These arteries are accurately dissected free from one another to facilitate great vessel anastomoses.

The donor heart is removed from the ice chest, and fluid from the inner bag cultured. The roof of the left atrium is dissected free from the posterior aspect of the right and left pulmonary artery segments. The aorta is dissected from the pulmonary trunk, which is then divided just proximal to its bifurcation unless additional pulmonary artery is necessary for reconstruction. A cuff of left atrium is created by incising through the pulmonary vein orifices (Fig. 21-9, *A*). The right atrium is prepared by incising through the inferior vena caval orifice and extending the incision toward the base of the right atrial appendage approximately equidistant from the sulcus terminalis and the atrioventricular groove (Fig. 21-9, *B*).

During implantation, perfusate temperature is generally 28°C, with intermittent topical cooling using 4°C saline ice slush. No additional cardioplegic solution is infused. The left atrial anastomosis is constructed first using continuous 3-0 polypropylene suture (Fig. 21-9, *C*). When constructing it, the first few stitches are placed "at a distance" before lowering the donor heart into the pericardial space. The remainder of the entire left atrial anastomosis is constructed in an everting fashion to provide endothelium-to-endothelium apposition, thereby reducing the chance of thrombus formation along the suture line. Construction of the far-leftward portion of the anastomosis along the left pulmonary veins is often facilitated by retracting the donor ascending aorta inferiorly with a traction suture. The right atrial anastomosis is also constructed with continuous 3-0 polypropylene suture. In the area over the interatrial septum, the suture lines are partially overlapping (Fig. 21-9, *D*). Each chamber is filled with cold saline before securing the suture lines.

The aortic anastomosis is constructed with continuous 4-0 polypropylene suture after the donor and recipient aortas are cut to appropriate length. A cardioplegia catheter to be used as a "needle vent" for aspirating air is placed in the donor ascending aorta. Air is evacuated from the heart through the aortic suture line, and the suture line secured. The aortic clamp is removed with strong suction on the needle vent.

This is a critical period during the operation because the donor heart is being reperfused after a prolonged period of global ischemia. It is useful to infuse one or two ampules of adenosine just prior to aortic clamp removal to facilitate maximal dilatation of the subendocardial arterioles during early reperfusion. In most instances, the donor heart will

**Figure 21-8** Donor cardiectomy for orthotopic cardiac transplantation. **A,** Inferior vena cava is divided at its junction with right atrium. Most of the intrapericardial inferior vena cava is left behind attached to the liver, because nearly all these operations are for multiorgan procurement. Right pulmonary vein is incised to vent the left heart. (When lungs are being harvested, left atrioventricular groove is generously incised to provide egress of the pulmonary preservation solution). Aorta is occluded when the heart empties. Cold cardioplegic solution is administered through the catheter to the aortic root to achieve total electromechanical arrest. **B,** Heart is retracted superiorly, exposing pulmonary veins and left pulmonary artery.

It is packed in saline solution in triple sterile bags for transport.

begin rhythmic contractions within 1 to 3 minutes of clamp removal. If ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia occurs, the heart should be promptly defibrillated. An esmolol hydrochloride infusion is initiated temporarily if marked sinus tachycardia or frequent ventricular arrhythmias occur during early reperfusion. Esmolol is particularly useful in this setting because it reduces myocardial oxygen consumption when the heart is recovering from the period of ischemia, and its duration of action is very short; thus, its effects will have dissipated before discontinuation of CPB.

When a gentle sinus rhythm is established, preparations are made for the pulmonary artery anastomosis. (Some surgeons prefer to complete this anastomosis before removing the aortic clamp.) The pulmonary artery segments are cut to an appropriate length and the anastomosis constructed, usually with 4-0 or 5-0 polypropylene suture (Fig. 21-9, *E*).

The remainder of the operation is conducted as usual during rewarming, and CPB is gradually discontinued after thoroughly de-airing the heart through the aortic needle vent while examining it for residual air with TEE. Immediately before and after discontinuing CPB, the function of each ventricle is assessed with TEE, and appropriate interventions made if necessary to improve function.

**D,** Right atrial anastomosis is commenced on interatrial septum. This suture line overlaps the atrial septal portion of the left atrial anastomosis. **E,** Aortic and pulmonary trunk anastomoses are completed. (From Kirklin and colleagues.K14) **Figure 21-9, cont'd**

## *Bicaval Technique*

Preparations for and initiation of CPB are identical to those for the biatrial technique. The SVC cannula should be placed 1 cm or more superior to the cavo–right atrial junction to facilitate the SVC anastomosis. If multiple implantation techniques are used at a given institution, clear communication to the donor procurement team is necessary to ensure the harvesting of all available donor SVC up to entrance of the brachiocephalic vein.

General conduct of the operation is the same as for the biatrial technique. Following aortic clamping, caval tapes are secured, and an incision made in the left atrium anterior to the right pulmonary veins as for mitral valve surgery. The incision is extended under the IVC and superiorly to the level of the right pulmonary artery. A cardiotomy sump is placed into the left atrium, and a generous cuff of right atrium adjacent to the IVC opening is retained. Within the right atrium, this cuff usually involves an incision through or immediately inferior to the coronary sinus orifice. With the cautery on a low setting, pericardial attachments are freed up from the IVC cuff, and this area is separated from the cut edge of the left atrium to facilitate implanting the donor heart.

Similarly, a cuff of right atrium adjacent to the entrance of the SVC is created, and its attachments to the underlying pulmonary trunk are divided to facilitate ease of later anastomosis. Commonly, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator leads are present in the recipient heart and are frequently densely adherent to the interior surface of the SVC. These should be freed up, mobilized, pulled as far as possible into the surgical field, and divided. This allows them to retract back into the upper SVC (where adhesions to the leads are uncommon) for ease of later extraction through the defibrillator pocket. The great arteries are divided proximally, and the remainder of the incisions along the inferior, superior, and left lateral aspects of the left atrium are as for the biatrial technique. A cuff of left atrium should be preserved above the entrance of the left pulmonary veins (Fig. 21-10, *A*).

Implantation begins with the left atrial anastomosis, which starts inferiorly, moving toward the left pulmonary veins (Fig. 21-10, *B*). Whenever possible, an everting suture technique should be used to promote direct endothelial apposition and avoid potential thrombus formation that might be more likely with an inverting anastomosis. When the suture line approaches the left atrial appendage in the donor heart, the geometry should be briefly reevaluated to ensure that the donor SVC will lie appropriately for the SVC anastomosis. If the recipient's left atrium seems considerably larger than the donor's, the base of the donor's left atrial appendage can be incised slightly to lengthen it. When this suture line reaches the area of the right pulmonary veins, it is generally completed with the second arm of a 3-0 polypropylene suture. The left atrium is filled with cold saline solution and the suture line secured. Throughout implantation, cold saline slush is applied to the donor heart to minimize the tendency for metabolic activity.

The IVC anastomosis is constructed next, usually with 4-0 polypropylene suture. If the donor heart is considerably smaller than the recipient heart, it is particularly important to retain a sizeable cuff of right atrium near the IVC to prevent tension on that anastomosis.

Although various strategies have been used for the remainder of the anastomoses, we recommend proceeding with the aortic anastomosis next, after appropriately trimming lengths of donor and recipient aorta to allow nice geometric reconstruction of the new ascending aorta. Using continuous 4-0 polypropylene suture, a standard end-to-end anastomosis is constructed (Fig. 21-10, *C*). A double suture line technique, in which the first line is a continuous everting mattress suture followed by a simple running suture, is particularly hemostatic. Before securing the suture line, air is evacuated from the heart by vigorous expansion of the lungs, and the suture line is secured.

During rewarming, after a stable sinus rhythm has been established, the SVC anastomosis is constructed with

![](_page_19_Picture_2.jpeg)

continuous 5-0 polypropylene suture. It is important to avoid excessive redundancy in creating the new SVC, because any kinking of the caval pathway can result in a venous pressure gradient. The pulmonary end-to-end anastomosis is constructed as in the biatrial technique.

## General Intraoperative Considerations

In patients with a previous sternotomy, particularly with previous bypass surgery, the likelihood of acute severe cardiac decompensation is greatly increased if there is inadvertent injury to the patient's saphenous or internal thoracic artery graft. In this situation, routine insertion of a percutaneous trunk anastomoses. (From Kirklin and colleagues.K14)

femoral artery catheter for arterial pressure monitoring is advantageous. Should decompensation occur, a guidewire for inserting an intraaortic balloon pump can be rapidly accomplished, or CPB established with a percutaneously inserted arterial cannula. In situations in which sternotomy is considered very high risk, a guidewire can also be placed in the femoral vein for percutaneous venous cannulation if necessary.

In preparing every donor heart prior to implantation, the area of the fossa ovalis should be specifically examined. If a patent foramen ovale is identified, it must be surgically closed. Failure to do so has resulted in severe hypoxemia and rightto-left shunting early after cardiac transplantation in a situation of right ventricular dysfunction, particularly in the presence of elevated pulmonary artery pressure.S6

Tricuspid regurgitation detected by Doppler echocardiography is common after orthotopic cardiac transplantation. This may relate to geometry of the newly constructed right atrium; an association has been suggested between larger relative size of the donor right atrium to the recipient's and the likelihood of tricuspid regurgitation.S1 Thus, consideration should be given to excising excess right atrial tissue, particularly on the lower side of the anastomosis, without jeopardizing the sinoatrial node. Less commonly, mitral valve regurgitation has been observed, associated with the "snowman" configuration formed by the donor-recipient left atrial anastomosis.S15

During construction of the left atrial suture line, the orifice of the left pulmonary vein should be observed. Excessive protrusion of tissue from the suture line with an inverting technique can potentially obstruct pulmonary venous inflow and may also be thrombogenic. In extreme cases, surgically induced cor triatriatum secondary to anastomotic obstruction of pulmonary venous inlet has been reported.B16

Sinus node dysfunction occasionally occurs. Therefore, specific attention to avoiding damage to the sinoatrial node is important during harvesting and implantation. The ligature on the SVC should be placed 1 to 2 cm above the superior cavo–right atrial junction. The incision in the donor right atrium should be kept well above the sulcus terminalis to avoid damaging the sinoatrial node while constructing the lower right atrial suture line.

Kinking of the pulmonary trunk may occur if the length of the newly constructed pulmonary trunk is redundant.W14 Therefore, care must be taken to trim sufficient donor and recipient pulmonary trunk to avoid redundancy after constructing the anastomosis. The newly constructed pulmonary trunk is particularly vulnerable with an oversized donor heart relative to the size of the recipient's pericardial space. Redundancy that results in kinking of the pulmonary trunk can produce an important gradient across the pulmonary anastomosis with resultant severe right ventricular hypertension.

Adverse neurologic events can occur. Mural thrombus may be potentiated by an excessively inverting suture line, particularly in the left atrium. Effective and complete deairing of the heart is extremely important to minimize the risk of cerebral air embolism. When systemic vascular resistance is low following heart implantation, flow rates during CPB must be adequate. Although the precise level of perfusion pressure and flow rate that contribute to neurologic events has not been clearly defined, systemic mean perfusion pressure should be maintained at 40 mmHg or greater during rewarming, with a perfusion flow rate of 4.2 to 4.8 L·min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> .

In the presence of important right ventricular dysfunction during rewarming, a second left atrial catheter is placed for infusion of inotropic agents, and prostaglandin E1 and other vasodilator agents can be infused into the central venous lines. If this is not successful and pulmonary hypertension is present, nitric oxideB3,K5,W11 can be used as an inhalational agent.

## SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Usual care given to patients after cardiac surgery (see Chapter 5) is applied to patients who have received a cardiac transplant. Generally, subsystems function normally, and little or no special therapy is required. Cardiac function of the donor heart is usually good but is subject to influences of total denervation and consequences of myocardial ischemia attending explant and transplant. Cardiac denervation may temporarily lower heart rate; consequently, a chronotropic catecholamine agent may be indicated. Isoproterenol in doses of 0.01 to 0.1 µg· kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ·min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> or atrial pacing can be used to maintain an appropriate heart rate for patient age and size. Generally, the effects of β-adrenergic agents are unchanged. Cardiac ischemia results in reduced diastolic compliance, so somewhat higher cardiac filling pressures may be required for optimal function. Impaired systolic function and contractility may also be observed, manifested by increased left atrial or pulmonary artery wedge pressure. Inotropic support is often required for 2 to 5 days, depending on function of the donor heart.

Acute distention and failure of the right ventricle resulting from excessive right ventricular afterload is occasionally observed, most commonly in the presence of preexisting recipient pulmonary hypertension or reactive pulmonary vasoconstriction from CPB or protamine administration. Various agents may dilate pulmonary vasculature, but the most effective combination appears to be milrinone at 0.3 to 1 µg·kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ·min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and nitric oxide. Rarely, right ventricular mechanical support is required.

Aspirin, 325 mg daily, is given as soon as oral intake is begun and is continued indefinitely to counteract (at least in part) the tendency of the donor heart to develop coronary arteriosclerosis. Iron supplementation (ferrous sulfate 325 mg three times daily) is given until hematocrit is stable. A histamine H2-receptor antagonist is administered routinely to counteract adverse effects of steroids on the gastric mucosa.

## Immunosuppressive Modalities

Immunosuppressive modalities in transplantation are designed to reduce intensity of the immune response to a degree that allows acceptance of the allograft, yet provides sufficiently low toxicity to permit prolonged survival. Pharmacologic agents have evolved from general suppression of the recipient's immunologic defenses to selective blockade of intracellular immune events that maximize graft acceptance while minimizing toxicity.

Three situations require specific combinations of immunosuppressive therapies: (1) *initial* high-dose immunosuppression to facilitate graft acceptance, minimize the chance of early rejection, and potentially favor induction of tolerance; (2) *maintenance* therapy for chronic acceptance of the allograft; and (3) *augmented* immunosuppression to reverse episodes of acute rejection. Specific immunotherapeutic modalities are being evaluated to prevent or reverse chronic rejection in the form of allograft vasculopathy.

The immune response to transplantation is highly dependent on T-cell activation and proliferation.G9 The cellular events of T-cell activation are of great importance because many current immunosuppressive drugs target specific intracellular pathways of T-cell activation. A summary of modalities that interfere with specific phases of the allograft-induced immune response is given in Table 21-4.

Although there is considerable variability among institutions, the general strategy involves induction therapy

followed by maintenance therapy with initial "triple-drug" immunosuppression followed by gradual tapering or withdrawal of the steroid component. Induction therapy generally includes one of two approaches:

- 1. Daclizumab or basiliximab, which block IL-2 receptors
- 2. Antithymocyte globulin or OKT3, which targets the T-cell receptor and causes it to be removed from the cell surface or induces destruction of the entire cell through multiple mechanisms

Maintenance immunosuppression generally includes immunosuppressive agents from three general classes, comprising the triple-drug strategy:

- 1. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus interfere with calciummediated signaling via calcineurin, which blocks production and release of IL-2, which is essential for proliferation of cytotoxic TH cells.
- 2. Mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide are often referred to as *antiproliferative agents* because of their basic action of interfering with T-cell proliferation.
- 3. Adrenocorticosteroids, usually methylprednisolone or prednisone, have multiple mechanisms of action. In addition to an antiinflammatory effect, they inhibit transcription of multiple cytokines, impair macrophage function, and decrease circulating lymphocytes.

## *Adrenocortical Steroids*

Corticosteroids are generally administered intraoperatively before cardiac transplantation and constitute a portion of the maintenance strategy. Some centers continue at least lowdose prednisone therapy indefinitely, but an effective alternative strategy is to rapidly reduce and withdraw steroids in the early postoperative period. A summary of the important features and dosing of corticosteroids is found in Box 21-7.

#### *Cyclosporine*

Viability of heart transplantation as a therapeutic option for end-stage heart disease is directly linked to clinical availability of cyclosporine in 1979.B33,G17 Clinical features and dosing of cyclosporine are summarized in Box 21-8. Animal studies suggest that cyclosporine may be most effective when given before the antigenic challenge, a situation perhaps related to lower serum lymphokine concentration before onset of rejection. Absorption of cyclosporine is somewhat variable, but peak blood levels are achieved by about 3.5 hours. Bioavailability of the oral solution at steady state is about 30%. Approximately 90% of circulating cyclosporine is protein bound, and half-life is about 20 hours. Cyclosporine is eliminated primarily by the liver, with only about 6% by the kidneys. Cyclosporine blood concentration can be importantly affected by administration of other drugs, as summarized in Table 21-5 and Box 21-9.

Renal toxicity, the major toxicity of cyclosporine, occurs in 25% to 38% of patients, manifested in the acute phase by

oliguria and elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. These effects are largely initiated by renal arteriolar vasoconstriction, which occurs mainly at the level of the preglomerular arterioles.E2,N4 The intrarenal renin-angiotensin system may contribute to both nephrotoxic and hypertensive effects of cyclosporine, because cyclosporine stimulates renin synthesis and release from renal juxtaglomerular cells and afferent arteriolar vessel wall.K21 Chronic cyclosporine nephrotoxicity is characterized by patchy glomerular sclerosis with interstitial fibrosis and thickening of capillary basement membranes. Once chronic renal damage has occurred, it is usually unresponsive to a decrease in cyclosporine dosage or drug withdrawal. Common drugs that increase nephrotoxicity of cyclosporine are listed in Table 21-6.

Less severe adverse side effects include reversible hepatotoxicity, fluid retention, hirsutism (20%-45%), gum hypertrophy (9%-16%), hypertension (53%), tremor (20%-50%), and rarely, late development of lymphoma (although this may result from overimmunosuppression with multiple agents).

#### *Tacrolimus*

Tacrolimus (initially called *FK506*) was first isolated in 1984 from the bacteria *Streptomyces tsukubaensis.*K6 It was first used clinically in 1989 as replacement therapy for cyclosporine in liver transplantation.F7 Tacrolimus is a macrolide compound unrelated to cyclosporine and with different binding sites. However, their basic immunosuppressive effects are similar. Tacrolimus gains its immunosuppressive effect by binding to a protein called *FKBP-12*, and it is the FKBP-12–tacrolimus complex that blocks calcineurin. In general, both the immunosuppressive effects and toxicity of tacrolimus exceed that of cyclosporine, possibly related to its binding affinity to FKBP, which is much greater than the binding affinity of cyclosporine to cyclophilin, the binding protein for cyclosporine.

From Kirklin and colleagues.K14

A major side effect of tacrolimus that differs from cyclosporine is its marked tendency to induce diabetes. Unlike cyclosporine, gingival hyperplasia and hirsutism are rare with tacrolimus. Although unproven, there appears to be a higher propensity for lymphoproliferative malignancies with tacrolimus. Clinical features and dosing of tacrolimus are listed in Box 21-10.

## *Azathioprine*

Azathioprine was thought to be only of historical interest when cyclosporine became available, but it was soon shown that triple-drug therapy was advantageous. Azathioprine again became part of the immunosuppression protocol along with cyclosporine and adrenocortical steroids. It is an imidazole derivative of 6-mercaptopurine. Mycophenolate mofetil has largely replaced azathioprine as the antiproliferative component of triple-drug immunosuppression. Clinical features and dosing of azathioprine are listed in Box 21-11.

## *Mycophenolate Mofetil*

Mycophenolic acid, the immunologically active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil, potently inhibits guanine synthesis, a critical enzyme in de novo synthesis of purines, by producing reversible noncompetitive inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. Blockade of this pathway for de novo DNA synthesis is unique to human lymphocytes, because most human cells can also synthesize purines for DNA through an alternative salvage purine pathway. Thus, human lymphocytes are uniquely susceptible to the action of mycophenolate mofetil.

Mycophenolate mofetil has greater antiproliferative potency than cyclosporine and has a potentially favorable effect on preventing allograft vaculopathy.O3 Its clinical features and dosing are summarized in Box 21-12.

#### *Cyclophosphamide*

Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent derived from nitrogen mustard; it interferes with DNA replication by alkylating and cross-linking DNA strands. Both B cells and T cells are affected, with greater toxicity on B cells. This feature has prompted substitution of cyclophosphamide for other antiproliferative agents (mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine)

#### **Box 21-10** Tacrolimus

#### **Clinical Use**

Chronic maintenance immunosuppression (alternative to cyclosporine), either as primary choice or conversion from cyclosporine due to recurrent or hemodynamically compromising rejection

#### **Mechanism**

Calcineurin blockade, inhibition of IL-2 production, inhibition of T-cell proliferation

#### **Dose**

Initial oral or sublingual dose early posttransplant is 1-2 mg every 12 hours. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary while doses are progressively increased to achieve target blood levels.

When converting from cyclosporine to tacrolimus with normal renal function, discontinue cyclosporine and begin tacrolimus at approximately 5 mg PO twice daily (adults) and adjust dosage according to trough levels.

In the presence of renal dysfunction (creatinine > 1.7), begin with very-low-dose tacrolimus both early after transplant and when converting from cyclosporine (1-2 mg twice daily in adults).

in the presence of antidonor antibodies and recurrent rejection. Its clinical features and dosage are listed in Box 21-13.

#### *Methotrexate*

Methotrexate is primarily an antineoplastic agent that has proved effective in treating leukemia, psoriasis, and adult rheumatoid arthritis. It is an analog of folic acid and binds competitively to the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. This folic acid antagonist inhibits purine synthesis, resulting in inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation as well as other rapidly dividing cell lines. Methotrexate has important effects on both humoral and cellular immunityG16,K1,L8 and has been used as an effective adjunct to standard immunosuppression for recurrent or persistent acute rejection.C19,H16 Clinical features and dosing are summarized in Box 21-14.

## *Sirolimus*

Sirolimus is a natural product of the actinomycete *Streptomyces hygroscopicus*, first isolated from a soil sample collected on Easter Island in 1965.F8,V5 Sirolimus is a macrolide antibiotic with a structure similar to tacrolimus but with a different mechanism of action. It belongs to a new class of immunosuppressive agents called *target of rapamycin* (TOR) inhibitors. TOR is a cytoplasmic enzyme that plays a critical role in converting signals from the T-cell surface to the cell nucleus for stimulation of growth and proliferation of

lymphocytes.A5 TOR appears to play an important role in both cellular and humoral effector functions.A1 Like cyclosporine and tacrolimus, sirolimus is a prodrug that binds to an immunophilin to exert its immunologic effects. In contrast to cyclosporine and tacrolimus, sirolimus inhibits neither calcineurin phosphates nor production of T-cell cytokines. Instead, it inhibits cell proliferation stimulated by growth factors. The net effect is selective blockade of cytokine signalmediated cell division and proliferation with arrest of the cell cycle in the G1 phase. Thus, sirolimus acts synergistically with cyclosporine and tacrolimus.

Sirolimus can be combined with cyclosporine or tacrolimus in place of azathioprine or mycophenolate, or it can be added as a fourth agent to control recurrent or refractory rejection. In the presence of important renal dysfunction, it may be substituted for either cyclosporine or tacrolimus and used in combination with steroids and mycophenolate, although risk of rejection is likely increased with this combination. Caution should be observed in administering sirolimus in the first few weeks after transplantation because it may importantly impair wound healing. Its clinical features and toxicity are summarized in Box 21-15.

#### *Antithymocyte Globulin*

Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is a polyclonal antilymphocyte preparation containing variable amounts of specific antibodies directed against T-cell molecules. Antibodies with activity directed against HLA class I and II antigens as well as adhesion molecules (CD11a/C18) have been identified.B18

ATG is used clinically either as prophylactic induction therapy during the first 5 to 7 days after transplantation or as an immunosuppressive modality to treat recurrent or persistent rejection. In the presence of early renal dysfunction (particularly with serum creatinine in excess of 2 mg·dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), ATG can be substituted for the calcineurin inhibitor until renal function normalizes. The associated profound lymphopenia that results predisposes immunosuppressed patients to

viral infections, particularly cytomegalovirus. Therefore, prophylactic valganciclovir should be administered following a course of ATG therapy.

The current available commercial preparation in the United States is a rabbit ATG (thymoglobulin). The reconstituted preparation contains 5 mg of thymoglobulin, of which greater than 90% is rabbit gamma immune globulin. The standard dose of 1.5 mg· kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ·day<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> is infused through a central venous catheter over 4 to 6 hours and administered for 5 to 14 days. Clinical features and dosing of ATG are summarized in Box 21-16.

## *Monoclonal Antibodies*

Monoclonal antibodies offer a potential advantage over polyclonal preparations (which lack specificity) because their specificity provides a means by which certain cell surface molecules can be targeted. The mechanism by which immunosuppression and associated side effects occur depends on the target of the antibody and isotype and species used to generate the antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are typically derived from mice or rats, but some antibodies, such as the current anti-IL2 receptor drugs, are "humanized" in that the portions of the genes that do not code for the antigenbinding regions of the mouse monoclonal antibody have been removed and replaced with portions of a human antibody molecule. This tends to decrease the allergenic side effects of the monoclonal preparation.

**OKT3 (Anti-CD3)** The CD3 antigen is present on essentially all mature T lymphocytes and is closely linked to the antigen recognition site of the T-cell receptor. Following engagement of the T-cell receptor to an antigen outside the cell, the CD3 complex transmits an intracellular signal that initiates T-cell activation.

From Kirklin and colleagues.K14

OKT3 is a murine monoclonal antibody specific for the portion of the CD3 complex involved in transmembrane signaling following binding of an antigen-MHC complex. Because CD3 is expressed only on T cells, administration of OKT3 depletes CD3 cells from the peripheral blood in 30 to 60 minutes. Although some of the cells undergo phagocytosis with subsequent removal by the reticuloendothelial system, many T lymphocytes undergo modulation, in which shedding or capping of the CD3 complex occurs without cell death. When OKT3 is discontinued and antibody level falls below therapeutic levels, T lymphocytes can reexpress the CD3 molecule on the T-cell receptor complex within a few hours. This phenomenon of rapid reappearance of CD3<sup>+</sup> cells soon after discontinuation of therapy (which does not occur after treatment with polyclonal ATG), coupled with clinical observations of occasional acute rejection within 1 week of ending OKT3 therapy, have prompted some programs to routinely augment steroid doses for several days after completion of OKT3 therapy.

OKT3 is used primarily as induction therapy or in treating acute or refractory rejection. Its clinical features and dosing are summarized in Box 21-17.

**Anti-CD25 (Basiliximab, Daclizumab)** The two anti-CD25 antibodies currently available, basiliximab and daclizumab, are humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibodies that bind specifically to the α chain (Tac subunit) of the highaffinity IL-2 receptor on activated T lymphocytes. They contain approximately 90% human and 10% murine antibody sequences. These antibodies compete with the cytokine IL-2 for occupancy of the IL-2 receptor. Secretion of IL-2 by an activated T cell serves to recruit other T cells by stimulation and clonal expansion of a specific T-cell population. These

anti–IL-2 receptor monoclonal antibodies are designed to be used with a calcineurin blocking agent (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) to decrease the amount of IL-2 that would be available for any unblocked IL-2 receptors. Clinical features and dosing of anti-CD25 monoclonal antibodies are presented in Box 21-18.

#### *Plasmapheresis*

Plasmapheresis involves removing blood from the patient, separating plasma by centrifugation or membrane filtration, and reconstituting the remaining blood to the original volume with fresh plasma or 5% albumin.

In treating acute rejection, plasmapheresis has been effective in removing antibodies (antibody-mediated rejection) as well as soluble mediators potentially released during acute rejection, including IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, B4,S12 and the anaphylatoxin C3a. Some of these mediators, such as TNF-α and IL-1, have a direct depressant effect on myocyte contractility, and improved ejection fraction following plasmapheresis has been observed frequently in the setting of hemodynamically compromising rejection.

The technique of plasmapheresis requires a large-bore indwelling catheter inserted into the internal jugular, subclavian, or femoral vein. Although complement-mediated reactions occasionally occur during plasmapheresis, side effects are generally mild. The potential for bleeding complications appears to be low as long as the fibrinogen level is maintained above 100 mg·dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> .

When used clinically to treat rejection with hemodynamic compromise, plasmapheresis is generally performed for 3 successive days as long as the fibrinogen level remains above 100 mg·dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> .

When antidonor antibodies are identified in the recipient, plasmapheresis is also used following cardiac transplantation, usually at weekly intervals until these antibodies are no longer detectable.

#### *Immunoadsorption*

Whereas plasmapheresis is a passive process in which immunoglobulins pass through the filtration membranes with the

Some centers use immunoadsorption techniques in the presence of recipient anti-HLA class I antibodies against the donor heart.A8,I1,K17 Improved ejection fraction and decrease in PRA following acute vascular rejection have been reported with this therapy.O5

## *Photopheresis*

Photopheresis is an immunomodulatory therapy based on leukapheresis. It involves drawing blood, separating the whole blood by centrifugation, and returning the red cells and plasma to the patient. Leukocytes are treated with 8-methoxypsoralen, a photosensitizing agent, and exposed to ultraviolet light in the photoactivation chamber. These treated leukocytes are then returned to the patient (Fig. 21-11).

The mechanism of action of photopheresis has not been clearly delineated, but available evidence suggests that photopheresis induces apoptosis of leukocytes that, when reinfused into the patient, are phagocytized by dendritic cells in the circulation and in lymphoid tissue. The photoactivation process induces cross-linking of DNA, which is known to induce apoptosisJ6,Y2 of lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and B cells. Recent data suggest that virtually all cells become apoptotic following extracorporeal photopheresis, even terminally differentiated and slowly proliferating or nonproliferating cells such as antigen-presenting cells.G10,L1,M1 Studies of extracorporeal photopheresis in a mouse heart transplant study by George and colleaguesG10,L1,M1 suggest that photopheresis alters the composition of recipient T lymphocytes toward a greater preponderance of T-regulatory cells, which promote down-regulation of graft-infiltrating T cells. In the mouse model, the majority of photopheresistreated cells are phagocytized in the spleen and liver within 24 hours. Extracorporeal photopheresis reduces the infiltration of graft-specific T cells without affecting the frequency of graft-reactive T cells in the peripheral lymph nodes. Thus, based on these studies, extracorporeal photopheresis appears

to alter the composition of recipient T cells toward a greater preponderance of T-regulatory cells, down-regulating a greater proportion of graft-infiltrating T cells.

A clinical study of photopheresis indicated that among patients at high risk for rejection, risk of hemodynamically compromising (potentially fatal) rejection or rejection death was substantially reduced following photopheresis therapy (Fig. 21-12).K10 These studies have generated the hypothesis that the apoptotic cells undergo phagocytosis by antigenpresenting cells. The phagocytized apoptotic cell fragments induce antigen-presenting cells to activate T-regulatory cells, which in turn induce down-regulation of T-effector cells against the allograft. The result is an increase in the proportion of natural regulatory T cells in the cardiac allograft.

## *Total Lymphoid Irradiation*

Total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) is low-dose radiotherapy that targets lymphoid tissues, including the cervical, axillary, mediastinal, periaortic, and iliofemoral lymph nodes, thymus, and spleen. Nonlymphoid tissue is shielded during treatment. The exact mechanisms by which TLI induces the immune response remain unclear, but it is known that radiation induces cell death from alterations in configuration of DNA, producing chromosomal breakage, translocations, and damage to purine and pyrimidine base pairs. Both T cells and B cells are susceptible to radiation injury.

TLI therapy, usually in combination with other immunosuppressive modalities, induces an initial depression in lymphocyte count that recovers after 3 to 4 months. However, the distribution of T-cell subpopulations and their expression of surface antigens show long-term changes. Some have hypothesized that TLI induces a population of natural suppressor cells that have similarities to NK cells.

TLI dosage includes three separate fields that provide radiation to all major lymphoid-bearing areas. These areas are treated with a total target dose of 800 cGy using twice-weekly doses of 80 cGy each. Azathioprine or other myelosuppressive agents are discontinued just prior to initiation of TLI to reduce radiation-induced bone marrow suppression. The treatment schedule is adjusted according to white blood cell and platelet counts.

TLI has been used extensively for refractory or severe rejection in both cardiac and renal transplantation. Donorspecific unresponsiveness to donor antigens has been demonstrated 18 to 30 months following renal transplantation with pretransplant TLI and ATG.C14,S19 TLI therapy has been effective in decreasing rejection frequency in adultsB11 and childrenK11 following cardiac transplantation.

The most common toxicity includes leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, which are usually reversible with temporary cessation of therapy. An unknown long-term risk of malignancy may exist.N1 A specific risk of fatal acute megakaryocytic leukemia was noted in one large series of patients treated with TLI after cardiac transplantation, with actuarial prevalence of 9% at 5 years.K14

## RESULTS

## Rejection

## *Mechanisms*

Cardiac allograft rejection represents the histologic and clinical result of the immunologic response (see "Immunologic Basis of Heart Transplantation" earlier in this section) to cardiac transplantation. Potential target cells within the heart include, among others, myocytes and endothelial cells of the coronary vasculature. Donor peptide antigens provide the stimulus for the recipient alloimmune response through their presentation by donor antigen-presenting cells (donor vascular endothelial cells and so-called passenger leukocytes) and recipient antigen-presenting cells. Multiple redundant immunologic pathways exist for activation of the immune response and subsequent attack on the donor organ. The presentation of donor antigens (by antigen-presenting cells) to the appropriate recipient T cells leads to T-cell activation and clonal proliferation in the presence of appropriate co-stimulatory molecules. The vascular endothelium participates directly in the rejection process by recruiting immune cells to the allograft. Up-regulation (increased concentration on the cell surface) of endothelial molecules induces circulating activated lymphocytes to stick to the endothelial surface and migrate into the interstitial spaces of the allograft. Activated T cells generate and release cytokines, which together with up-regulation of T-cell surface receptors induces proliferation of immune cells and recruitment of macrophages. If unabated by immunosuppressive agents, these events result in release of powerful biological effectors of myocyte injury and necrosis, recognizable by histologic examination.

Success of cardiac transplantation (and organ transplantation in general) is based on the premise that immunosuppressive modalities can effectively suppress those aspects of the immune system that, when stimulated by donor HLA antigens, ultimately lead to destruction of the donor heart. The process of controlling and potentially preventing otherwise fatal allograft rejection to promote long-term survival and function of the transplanted heart involves initial immunosuppression, chronic maintenance immunosuppression, and augmentation or adjustment of immunosuppression during episodes of identified acute rejection. Because immunosuppressive agents have considerable toxicity, long-term patient survival requires a combination of immunosuppressive agents that act in concert or even synergistically against those aspects of the immune system that threaten the allograft, while minimizing their toxic effects on the overall immune system (which would set the stage for infections and malignancies) in other organ systems.

The difficulty of this task is confounded by considerable variability among patients with respect to the intensity of their immune response against the allograft and their susceptibility to immunosuppression-related morbidity.

Despite the current profound understanding of the immune response to transplantation and the myriad drugs available for targeted immunosuppression, many details of the precise inciting factors for acute rejection remain enigmatic. Patients can experience long periods (sometimes years) of apparent immunoquiescence (clinical and histologic absence of rejection criteria), only to suddenly experience a vigorous and potentially fatal immunologic attack, with no known precipitating event. The tendency for patients to display overt evidence of rejection only episodically is incompletely understood, but extensive clinical experience supported by surveillance endomyocardial biopsies indicates that the rejection process occurs in "waves" of heightened immunologic activity within the allograft. Although infectious agents (particularly viral) and possibly stress have been implicated at times, an inciting stimulus is usually never identified.

## *Pathology of Allograft Rejection*

The technique of endomyocardial biopsy, based on techniques first described by Caves'K9 histologic examination of myocardial tissue, has provided the gold standard for diagnosing rejection since 1972. The histologic grading system for rejection initially developed by BillinghamB13 at Stanford was further refined in 1990 by the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT), most recently in 2005 (Table 21-7).S16 Rejection grades are based mainly on amount of inflammatory infiltrate and presence of myocyte damage (see Table 21-7).

categories of acute rejection are *cellular, humoral*, and *hyperacute* rejection.

**Acute Cellular Rejection** Histologically, acute cellular rejection is a mononuclear inflammatory response, predominantly lymphocytic,B30 directed against the cardiac allograft. Usually both ventricles are equally involved,R9 and thus sampling of the right ventricular septum is usually representative of histologic changes occurring elsewhere in the heart. The key identifying histologic feature of cellular rejection of sufficient severity (moderate) to warrant augmentation of immunosuppression is the presence of myocyte damage.

**Humoral (Microvascular) Rejection** In heart transplantation, *humoral rejection* refers to rejection resulting from immunoglobulin (antibody) directed against donor antigens located on the endothelial surface of the allograft coronary microvasculature.B28,T4 Immunoglobulin and complement are localized in the microvasculature of the transplanted heart arterioles, capillaries, and venules. The resulting inflammatory process with neutrophils and macrophages involves the vessel wall. These inflammatory changes can be seen on endomyocardial biopsy. The hallmarks of microvascular rejection are endothelial cell activation, increased vascular permeability, and in severe forms, microvascular thrombosis and myocardial cell degeneration. Immunofluorescence studies are currently the primary modality for identifying fibrinogen, IgG, IgM, and complement components in the endomyocardial biopsy,H2 which indicates humoral rejection. Histologic and immunofluorescence criteria for identifying humoral rejection are summarized in Table 21-8. S16 However, it should be noted that the reproducibility of these studies is considerably less than the standard histologic methodology for identifying acute cellular rejection.

**Hyperacute Rejection** Hyperacute rejection (currently rarely observed) consists of a violent lethal immunologic attack on the allograft triggered by preformed antibodies against HLA epitopes in the donor heart or antibodies against the ABO system (in the event of inadvertent transplantation across a major blood group incompatibility). Rarely, hyperacute rejection may result from antiendothelial antibodies.B28 Activation of the complement cascade produces severe endothelial cell damage, platelet activation, initiation of the clotting cascade, and widespread microvascular thrombosis,

all of which leads uniformly to graft loss. The process begins within minutes of graft reperfusion in the operating room. With current techniques of identifying preformed anti-HLA antibodies and crossmatching, hyperacute rejection is rarely observed.

## *Other Diagnostic Modalities*

Although electrocardiographic analysis,L5 cytoimmunologic monitoring,H1 and a variety of radionuclide techniques have been investigated, echocardiography is the primary modality (other than endomyocardial biopsy) routinely used for rejection surveillance.

The most important application of echocardiography is identifying systolic dysfunction. Even though left ventricular ejection remains within normal limits during 95% of histologic rejection episodes,M13 acute rejection is overwhelmingly the major cause of acute reduction in systolic function of the transplanted heart after initial recovery from transplantation. Other causes include advanced allograft vasculopathy, nonspecific unexplained graft failure without rejection or vasculopathy, and rarely infection. When acute depression of systolic function (ejection fraction < 50%) is observed without another clearly identified cause, acute cellular or humoral rejection should be assumed to be present and appropriately treated, with or without confirmation from endomyocardial biopsy.

transplantation, an understanding of the temporal pattern and risk factors for rejection is handicapped by the time of onset and resolution as well as the actual presence of rejection. Although endomyocardial biopsy is the gold standard for identifying rejection, it only allows intermittent sampling rather than continuous surveillance. The potential for sampling error, the reality of rejection episodes that spontaneously resolve and are never identified histologically, and the general practice of decreasing the frequency of endomyocardial biopsies after the first year complicate our understanding of this event. For practical purposes, most clinicians and investigators define a *rejection episode* as a clinical event that is usually, but not always, accompanied by an abnormal myocardial biopsy and results in acute and temporary augmentation of a patient's immunosuppression.K15

The frequency of rejection episodes tends to decrease with increasing time from transplantation, related in part to the acquired state of partial unresponsiveness achieved with current maintenance immunosuppression. Approximately two thirds of patients have one or more identified rejection episodes within the first year (Fig. 21-13).K19 The hazard function (instantaneous risk) for initial rejection peaks at 1 to 2 months, then rapidly decreases thereafter, merging with a low constant risk of rejection after about 1 year.K19

Of greater concern are those patients who suffer recurring rejection, with the need for repeated augmentation of immunosuppression, possibility of hemodynamic compromise secondary to graft dysfunction, increased risk of infection, and potential contribution to allograft vasculopathy. Risk factors for earlier initial rejection and for increased cumulative rejection during the first year are listed in Tables 21-9 and 21-10. Risk factors for recurrent rejection during the first posttransplant year are listed in Table 21-11. K19

## *High-Risk Forms of Rejection*

The highest-risk form of rejection is hyperacute rejection, discussed in the preceding text. Certain other forms of acute rejection are associated with risk of graft loss and death. These

forms may be primarily cellular or humoral, with considerable overlap because they are categorized by the method of identifying rejection (Box 21-19).

When vasculitis (transmural anterior wall infiltration of lymphocytes and monocytes with or without neutrophils) is identified on endomyocardial biopsy, or when there is evidence of humoral rejection by immunofluorescence studies, an increase in subsequent mortality has been identified, with 1-year mortality exceeding 30% in some studies.H2,L7,Z1 Similarly, when aggressive histologic grades of cellular rejection (Grade 3B or 4) are identified on endomyocardial biopsy, the likelihood for progression to hemodynamic compromise and graft loss is high without prompt aggressive immunosuppressive intervention.

Approximately 5% of rejection episodes are accompanied by hemodynamic compromise, as evidenced by clinical signs of low cardiac output, decreased ejection fraction on echocardiography, or decreased cardiac output. When inotropic agents are required to support the circulation, this serious form of rejection can be rapidly fatal if not promptly reversed. Although the mechanism of depressed systolic function is unclear, experimental studies indicate that IL-1, IL-2, and TNF may contribute.G18,H15,Y1 When hemodynamic compromise is associated with acute cellular rejection histology, mortality from rejection within the subsequent 2 years is about 20%. Prognosis is particularly ominous when clinical rejection with hemodynamic compromise is associated with absence of cellular rejection on biopsy, because it indicates a higher likelihood of humoral rejection. Such patients have a risk of death exceeding 50% within 2 years (Fig. 21-14).H12,M13,S12

In the presence of circulating antidonor HLA antibodies, the probability increases that acute rejection will involve humoral components,C11 which increases risk of subsequent rejection-related death or graft loss.G11

## *Identifying a Rejection Episode*

A major part of care after cardiac transplantation is directed toward identifying rejection. Endomyocardial biopsy remains the most important method of identification and, along with echocardiographic evaluation, is generally performed every 7 days for the first 4 to 6 postoperative weeks. Thereafter, biopsy frequency is gradually reduced to every 3 to 4 months. However, physicians caring for these patients must be aware that subtle symptoms may be the only clue to the beginning of a rejection episode. These include unexplained fever, joint pain, personality change, and any symptom that can result from cardiac failure. These are an indication for emergency endomyocardial biopsy and immediate institution of therapy if results are positive.

## *Treatment of Acute Rejection*

When a rejection episode is identified during the first postoperative month, particularly when accompanied by any hemodynamic deterioration, treatment includes hospitalization. Otherwise, treatment can be accomplished on an outpatient basis with close surveillance.M11 Decision about an inpatient or outpatient setting for treatment and the details of the treatment itself need to be made by experienced transplant physicians.

Augmenting steroid therapy is the mainstay of treating an acute rejection episode (see "Immunosuppressive Therapy" in text that follows). When the patient is treated as an outpatient, the daily prednisone dosage is increased to 100 mg in adults for 5 days. Generally, the dose is then reduced by 10 mg·day<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> until the previous maintenance dose is reached.

When treatment is given in the hospital, methylprednisolone is administered IV (usually into a peripheral vein) for 3 days in a dose of 1000 mg·day<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (or 15 mg· kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> if the patient weighs < 50 kg). This is followed by prednisone 100 mg by mouth (PO) for 2 days, which is reduced thereafter by 10 mg daily until the prior maintenance dose is reached.

If the rejection episode is unresponsive, recurrent early after transplantation, or associated with high-risk features, ATG for 5 to 7 days may be added. Other measures that may be used for an unremitting episode include changing from azathioprine to mycophenolate mofetil, changing from cyclosporine to tacrolimus, treating with pulse steroids without a taper, methotrexate, plasmapheresis, photopheresis, and even total lymphoid irradiation. Decisions regarding treatment modality depend on histologic grade of biopsy, left ventricular dysfunction, time since transplantation, and prior modalities used.

When the rejection episode is believed to have been resolved, another endomyocardial biopsy is obtained. If only mild rejection is present, the episode is considered to have resolved, but this is confirmed by frequent biopsies over the next 3 months.

When the hemodynamic state becomes unstable and the rejection episode is severe and unremitting, maximal treatment must be directed toward the immunosuppressive modalities described earlier while simultaneously supporting the circulation with inotropic agents. A general therapeutic strategy for rejection with hemodynamic compromise is outlined in Box 21-20. When treating recurrent or severe rejection with augmented immunosuppression, the increased risk of infection and of tumor formation, particularly lymphomas, must be appreciated and surveillance methods heightened.

heart transplant recipients to unusual organisms that may induce aggressive and sometimes fatal infections. A broad range of organisms may be involved, including the usual pathogens, organisms that are not usually a cause of infection except in immunocompromised hosts, and endogenous and donor-transmitted organisms. A proactive policy to detect infection is necessary because of the frequent blunting of usual infection signs and symptoms secondary to blunting of the normal inflammatory response by immunosuppressive medications. Infectious complications are closely linked to other posttransplant adverse events, such as malignancy (Epstein-Barr virus), allograft vasculopathy (cytomegalovirus), and acute rejection.

## *Risk Factors, Prevalence, and Evaluation*

Approximately 40% of recipients suffer one or more infections requiring IV antibiotics, hospitalization, or both during the first year after transplantation.M12 In the current era, most infections are successfully treated, with an overall mortality from infection of less than 5% during the first year.A9,R4 Risk factors for developing posttransplant infection are listed in Table 21-12.

The time course differs for various categories of infectious agents, with bacterial infections predominating during the first month and viral infections predominating thereafter (Fig. 21-15). Bacterial and viral infection each account for about 40% of infections during the first year, whereas about only 5% are fungal or protozoal.M12,M16 The periods of greatest risk for bacterial, viral, protozoal, and fungal infections have particular relevance in terms of diagnostic procedures and expectant therapy. Because of the tendency for febrile responses to be attenuated in the early phase of infectious diseases by corticosteroids (frequently part of maintenance immunosuppression), even low-grade fevers should precipitate thorough investigation for infectious etiologies.

Lung and urinary tract are the most common sites of infection during the first year, accounting for about 35% and 25% of infections, respectively.M16 Despite the prevalence of certain disease types or locations, unusual organisms, locations, and

modes of presentation must always be considered in the immunocompromised patient. Initial investigation should include a careful and thorough history and physical examination, chest radiogram, complete blood cell count, and bacterial, fungal, and viral blood cultures. Other cultures should be directed by the initial evaluation. Any new or worsening pulmonary infiltrate should prompt early bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy. *Pneumocystis carinii* and cytomegalovirus are the most common nonbacterial pathogens detected on bronchoalveolar lavage.L3 If biopsy and lavage do not produce a likely etiologic organism, open lung biopsy should be considered. Fever during the first posttransplant month should also prompt thorough evaluation of the sternotomy wound, including computed tomographic scanning. The risk of sternal infection is increased with use of a ventricular assist device as bridgeto-transplant therapy.F3

## *Bacterial Infections*

The most common bacterial infections in the early postoperative period are pneumonias, indwelling IV line infections, and (less commonly) wound infections. Patients requiring ventilator support immediately before transplantation are at high risk for posttransplant pneumonia. Central venous catheters should be removed within the first 5 days posttransplant when feasible, because bacteremia is common with prolonged indwelling central catheters. Sternal wound infections account for about 5% of serious early infections, and the risk of mortality associated with mediastinal infection approaches 20%.F3 Early, aggressive sternal débridement and pectoralis muscle coverage play a critical role in controlling infection, enabling early mobility and reducing mortality.

## *Viral Infections*

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the predominant viral pathogen causing disease in the first 3 months after cardiac transplantation. Prevalence of a positive CMV serology ranges from 40% to 80% in transplant recipients prior to transplantation.S10 Risk factors for development of posttransplant CMV infection include use of a heart from a donor positive for CMV serology when transplanted into a CMV-negative recipient, and use of induction therapy with monoclonal antibodies or ATG. Risk of CMV transmission is reduced by using leukocyte filters when transfusing blood and by using prophylactic valganciclovir for the first several months after transplantation.M9

CMV infection can affect multiple organs, resulting in many clinical presentations, including a symptomatic rise in antibody titer, a systemic febrile illness with malaise and lethargy, identification of CMV antigenemia in an asymptomatic patient, or localized disease in a specific organ. The most common site for localized disease is the lung (usually with pulmonary infiltrate, shortness of breath, and hypoxemia), followed by the gastrointestinal tract (fever, diarrhea, ulceration, and occasionally major gastrointestinal bleeding). Hepatic involvement is manifest as hepatitis. Opthalmic involvement may result in chorioretinitis with possible subsequent blindness. CMV infection is associated with accelerated rates of allograft vasculopathy and rejection.G14,M5,P7 Any CMV infection should be considered life threatening and requires specific aggressive therapy. The therapy of choice for preserving renal function and reducing bone marrow suppression is valganciclovir.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is discussed later in this section under "Malignancy."

Parvovirus infection requires special mention because of its association with bone marrow depression and development of pancytopenia in children. Parvovirus may result in fifth disease, with a typical blotchy maculopapular rash and mild systemic symptoms. The diagnosis may be confirmed by use of polymerase chain reaction studies of the parvovirus gene in circulating lymphocytes or bone marrow tissue. Treatment with hyperimmune globulin is usually effective.

#### *Fungal Infections*

Opportunistic fungal infections account for a small percentage of infections, but invasive fungal infection carries a mortality of 30% or more. Although there is an early posttransplant peak of risk (see Fig. 21-15), invasive fungal infection can occur at any time following transplantation. Its development usually results from breakdown of specific and nonspecific host defenses, such as breaching of skin and mucosal barriers, immunosuppression with impairment of nonspecific defenses (phagocytic cells), disruption of humoral and cellular immunity, and fungal overgrowth in the presence of prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotic administration. The most frequently occurring fungal infections are due to *Candida, Aspergillus, Pneumocystis jirovecii* (carinii), and *Cryptococcus neoformans.*M12 *Candida* is more commonly involved in sternal wound or bloodstream infections from breakdown of mucosal barriers. *Aspergillus* infections are primarily pulmonary, and cryptococcal infections involve the CNS (but can be disseminated). *P. jirovecii* is an organism of low virulence in non-immunocompromised patients, found in the lungs of humans and a variety of animals. The taxonomy of *P. jirovecii* has been controversial, but it is currently grouped with fungi rather than protozoa. It remains unclear whether patients with pneumocystic pneumonia represent primary or reactivation infections, because no reliable skin test or serology assay is available. Therefore, continuous prophylaxis may be indicated for patients with prior pneumocystic infection.A12 Patients typically present with worsening diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, progressive hypoxemia, and marked dyspnea. Silver stains of pathologic specimens from bronchoalveolar lavage are diagnostic. The preferred therapy is high-dose trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for 4 to 6 weeks. Pulmonary support with mechanical ventilation may be required, and renal function must be closely observed during treatment. A CMV infection commonly occurs with *Pneumocystis* pneumonia, and therefore empirical therapy is warranted while results of CMV stains of pathologic specimens and CMV cultures are pending.

## *Protozoal Infections*

Although protozoal infections can occur in any immunocompromised patient, toxoplasmosis is of specific importance in heart transplantation, because it most often occurs as a donor-transmitted disease when a seronegative recipient receives an infected organ. Disease onset occurs 4 to 8 weeks after transplantation and may be manifested as myocarditis, fever, pneumonitis, or (rarely) encephalitis.K18 Therapy of choice includes pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine. Untreated symptomatic toxoplasmosis in cardiac transplant recipients is usually fatal.

#### *Infection Prophylaxis*

Antimicrobial prophylaxis after heart transplantation is an integral part of infection prevention, and the benefit has clearly outweighed the disadvantages (toxicity and antimicrobial resistance). A recommended antimicrobial prophylaxis for heart and heart lung transplantation is outlined in Table 21-13.

Prevention of infection by active immunization is recommended for specific conditions, using killed vaccine only.C13

#### Malignancy

Neoplastic disorders after cardiac transplantation arise from three major causes: preexisting malignancies, transmission of malignancy from donor to recipient, and de novo malignancy arising after transplantation. As noted in Box 21-6, preexisting malignancy is a relative contraindication to cardiac transplantation unless there is a prolonged malignancy-free interval and strong clinical evidence of cure.

However, incomplete information is available to clearly predict the likelihood of recurrence of a preexisting malignancy based on malignancy-free interval and type of malignancy. In a compilation of nearly 150 heart and heart-lung transplant recipients with preexisting malignancies treated an average of 7 years prior to transplantation, persistence or recurrence of the malignancy occurred in nearly 20%.H9 Tumors most likely to recur in heart transplant recipients are carcinoma of the lung, lymphoma, skin cancer, and carcinoma of the bladder.H9

The incidence of de novo recipient malignancy is approximately 100 times that of the non–age-controlled general population.C22,O4 The prevalence and risk (hazard function) for various malignancies related to the interval following transplantation is depicted in Fig. 21-16. D7 Less than 5% of patients develop malignancy during the first year after cardiac transplantation, with the vast majority being either lymphomas (one third) or skin neoplasms (one third). However, in the setting of chronic immunosuppression, risk of fatal malignancy gradually increases over subsequent years (Fig. 21-17).D7

Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) requires separate discussion because of its unique relationship to organ transplantation. PTLD is believed to originate from EBV infection of the recipient's B lymphocytes.H13,N3 EBV may originate from the transplanted organ (an EBV serology– positive donor), through blood transfusions or community contacts, or through replication of latent EBV in a recipient in the presence of chronic immunosuppression. The abnormal EBV-specific susceptibility induced by immunosuppression allows the increased burden of EBV to infect recipient B cells and induce their transformation into expanding B-cell clones, which can become neoplastic.P3 A number of risk factors have been identified for development of PTLD (Box 21-21). Among heart transplant recipients, risk of a pretransplant EBV-seronegative patient developing PTLD is 25 to 30

times greater than in patients who are seropositive prior to transplantation.W2,W3 Of particular importance is the increased risk of PTLD that has been documented with prolonged use of cytolytic therapy such as OKT3C20 (and likely antithymocyte globulin). Although unproven, it has been hypothesized that OKT3 results in generation of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, which may promote EBV transcription and reactivation from a latent state.V6

Various histologic classifications of lesions in PTLD have been publishedP3 and include a disease spectrum ranging from plasmacytic hypoplasia (preservation of lymph node architecture and usually a benign course) at one end to monoclonal non-Hodgkin lymphoma, with clearly malignant

implications, at the other. Diagnosis of PTLD requires tissue biopsy, with sufficient tissue to allow assessment of cell type, clonality, biological studies, and architectural background.P3 Clinical presentation of PTLD is widely variable, ranging from an infectious mononucleosis–like illness to specific symptoms related to the organ system involved. Symptomatic lymphadenopathy is a common presentation. PTLD involving the gastrointestinal tract may result in necrosis, bleeding, proliferation, and obstruction.C8 CNS involvement can be either a localized disease or a result of dissemination of systemic PTLD. Pulmonary involvement frequently manifests as multiple nodules.

Optimal treatment of PTLD remains controversial because of absence of consensus in defining the pathology, a clear relationship between morphologic features and clinical course, large treatment trials, and relatively small numbers at any one institution. The basic options for treatment include (1) reduction of immunosuppression, (2) surgical extirpation, (3) chemotherapy, (4) antivirals, (5) anti–B-cell antibodies, and (6) cell-based therapies. The cornerstone of primary therapy involves reducing immunosuppression, with close subsequent monitoring of allograft function and frequent surveillance endomyocardial biopsy for rejection. Isolated disease amenable to surgery should be treated with extirpation. Disseminated disease usually requires additional chemotherapy or anti–B-cell monoclonal antibody administration.

Expected survival after diagnosis of PTLD is highly variable, depending on interval after transplantation,

morphologic features, and anatomic location(s).C8 It ranges from approximately 45% to 80% at 2 years. Multivisceral disease, late PTLD, and CNS involvement are associated with worse outcome.B12

#### Survival

Survival at 1 year has gradually improved over the past several decades and currently approaches 85% (Fig. 21-18).T1 Risk of death is greatest during the first 3 months after operation. After 1 year, there is a constant mortality of about 4% per year. Survival at 5 years is approximately 70%, at 10 years 50%, and at 15 years 30%.T1 Median survival is 10 years. For patients alive at 1 year, median survival is 13 years. Survival after retransplantation is discussed under "Cardiac Retransplantation" later in this section.

The most dramatic improvement in survival after heart transplantation over the past 25 years has been during the first 3 to 6 months (see Fig. 21-18). Despite the obvious importance of long-term survival to patients and their families, survival at 1 year has been a benchmark for comparison of institutions as well as eras.

## *Modes of Death*

Mode of death during the first year and thereafter differ considerably and therefore merit separate discussion. During the first 12 months after transplant, early graft failure, rejection, and infection account for more than 60% of deaths. This is reflected in the hazard functions for specific modes of death during the first 3 months (Fig. 21-19) and cumulative mode-specific mortality during the same period (Fig. 21-20).Y3

After the first year, infection and rejection account for less than 25% of primary causes of death, and allograft coronary disease and malignancy for nearly 50% (Figs. 21-21 and 21-22).

### *Risk Factors for Death*

**General Risk Factors** Among adult transplant recipients, multiple conditions or factors have been identified that are associated with increased risk of mortality during the first posttransplant year (Table 21-14). Temporary circulatory support is a major risk factor, producing a threefold increase in early mortality. In contrast, the incremental risk associated with long-term pulsatile left ventricular assist device use was

**Figure 21-20** Competing outcomes analysis of specific modes of death during first year after transplantation in the Cardiac Transplant Research Database *(CTRD)*. (From Young and colleagues. Y3)

statistically significant, but clinically of small importance. When survival was adjusted for covariables, an analysis of patients undergoing transplantation from 2002 through 2006 predicted only a 1.3-fold increase in 1-year mortality with pretransplant support using a long-term durable device. The Cardiac retransplantation is a major risk factor (see later text in this section), but few such operations are performed.

In reviewing this list of risk factors, it is important to note that some powerful risk factors not identified in large multivariable analyses are apparent in other studies. Further details about additional risk factors are included in text that follows.

a clear overall risk factor for premature death after cardiac transplantation. Survival after cardiac transplantation is highest among patients with a negative flow cytometry crossmatch to both HLA class I (T- and B-cell) antigens and HLA class II (B-cell) antigens (Fig. 21-23). B14

Risk of death appears to be less when the blood type of the recipient and donor is identical, but the effect is a weak one. There is evidence that donor and recipient gender do not affect outcomes, but when there is donor-recipient size mismatch (e.g., smaller female donor into larger male recipient), 1-year survival may be adversely affected. P10 Improvement in survival that occurred when triple-drug immunosuppression began ( $\approx 1983$ ) supports the idea that the immunologic response is a dominant determinant of outcomes.

Each symbol represents a death; vertical bars, 68% confidence limits; and numbers in parentheses, patients at risk. Class I antigen mismatch is against both T and B cells, class II antigens against B cells only. (From Bishay and colleagues.B14)

**Recipient Age** Patient age has been a risk factor for death after cardiac transplantation, particularly at very young age and advanced age. An age of 1 to 60 years is a weak determinant of survival.

**High Pulmonary Vascular Resistance** High Rp has also been a risk factor for death, usually early after transplantation.K12 The nature of the relationship between elevated Rp (or increasing transpulmonary gradient) and mortality risk is a continuous one, with progressive increase in risk as Rp rises. Preoperative response of Rp to vasodilator therapy has additional predictive value.B25,C21 (For details of Rp, see "Evaluation of Comorbid Conditions" earlier in this section.)

**Preoperative Status of the Patient** Patients whose cardiac output is importantly depressed before operation are at increased risk of death after transplantation. When organ dysfunction is substantial and does not recover from the effects of the low cardiac output state sufficiently rapidly after transplantation, mortality is markedly increased. The kidney is particularly vulnerable to even brief periods of low cardiac output.

The lung also appears to recover slowly from preoperative damage. Being on a ventilator up to the time of transplantation is a risk factor for death after transplantation.

When inotropes or mechanical circulatory assistance before transplantation bring the patient to operation in a reasonably good hemodynamic state, survival is similar to that of other cardiac transplant recipients.O2 Nevertheless, having a left ventricular assist device implanted before cardiac transplantation raises the risk of death during the first year by about 25% (*P =* .02).T1

**Global Myocardial Ischemic Time (Donor Heart)** With current techniques of donor heart preservation, global myocardial ischemic time does not become an important risk factor until it exceeds about 240 minutes. Risk of death is increased considerably with ischemic times of 5 to 6 hours. Speculatively, the explanation for the much longer safe ischemic time in the setting of cardiac transplantation than in reparative cardiac surgery may be the uniformly cold temperature of the globally ischemic donor heart and possibly its complete lack of collateral circulation.

Current information suggests that the safe global myocardial ischemic time for donor hearts is considerably prolonged by preparing and storing the heart in UW solution,J2,S14 which has an ionic concentration similar to intracellular fluid and contains antioxidants and high-molecular-weight molecules.W1 Use of this solution for both cardioplegia and cold storage appears to result in maintenance of high levels of high-energy phosphates and decreased lactate production.S14 Strategies for the initial phase of reperfusion may further increase safe ischemic time of donor hearts (see "Cold Cardioplegia, Aortic Root Reperfusion, and [When Needed] Warm Cardioplegic Induction" in Chapter 3).K13

**Era** The risk of cardiac transplantation decreased during the 1980s following introduction of cyclosporine and adoption of protocols that included triple-drug therapy.R8 Further improvement in early and late survival after cardiac transplantation and has been attributed to more precise immunosuppression agents and regimens, less severe graft coronary disease, statin drugs, and better understanding of infection complications, with greater choice of antibiotic and antiviral agents.M3

**Risk Factors for Late Mortality** When assessing the risk of mortality during the first year following transplantation, most studies have examined recipient variables that can be identified before the transplant procedure. However, late mortality is also affected to a major extent by events occurring after transplantation. Thus, each patient carries a unique risk profile going into the transplant operation, but additional events related to rejection, infection, graft function, and other issues heavily influence late survival (Table 21-15).

When specific causes of death are considered, the risk factor profile changes somewhat for each cause of death. For example, risk factors identified during the 1990s for patients surviving at least 1 year after transplantation have been specifically analyzed for death from allograft coronary artery disease (Table 21-16).C17 Cause-specific risk factors provide an opportunity for tailoring immunosuppression as well as risk factor modification to lower the risk of death from specific causes during long-term patient follow-up.

#### Allograft Coronary Artery Disease

Accelerated coronary artery disease is the third most common cause of death after cardiac transplantation, following only infection and acute rejection.J3 Furthermore, about 60% of retransplantation procedures are performed because of advanced coronary artery disease.G4 Most patients with this disease fail to experience typical angina, which may be related to the likelihood that the cardiac allograft remains denervated permanently (see "Cardiac Function" later in this section). Life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure from myocardial ischemia, silent myocardial infarction, and sudden death are usually the first signs of progression to advanced coronary artery disease in a transplanted heart.J3

Coronary artery disease begins to develop early after the recipient receives the transplanted heart; virtually all patients who survive more than 1 year have some histopathologic evidence of coronary artery disease.J4 The first step in the process appears to be concentric intimal thickening from myofibroblast proliferation and fibrosis. Within 1 to 2 years, aggregates of lipid-filled cells accumulate within the intima, and well-formed lipid cores consisting of cholesterol clefts and free-lying lipid debris (arteriosclerotic plaques) can be seen.J4 These arteriosclerotic lesions are indistinguishable from those of spontaneous arteriosclerosis. Coronary vasodilator reserve is well preserved as long as the diffuse coronary artery disease has no areas of narrowing greater than about 30%.M6 This may explain occasional occurrence of sudden death in cardiac transplant patients who have had good exercise capacity until the fatal event. However, during rejection episodes, coronary vasodilator reserve is severely impaired.P5 Speculatively, the resulting myocardial ischemia may play a major role in producing myocardial changes and symptoms during rejection episodes. The reduction appears to be reversible in most instances.

Pathogenesis of these important lesions is uncertain, but the etiologic factors likely include a major immunologic component as well as nonimmunologic factors. The frequency with which lymphocytes are seen within the intima and adventitia of the coronary arteries of transplanted hearts supports an immunologic component. Also, patients who produce anti-HLA antibodies after cardiac transplantation have reduced survival and a greater prevalence of coronary artery disease than those who do not.P4 A strong tendency to arteriosclerosis in the patient, as evidenced by important coronary artery disease in the native heart, may be a risk factor for this problem, as may hyperlipidemia and hypertension.G2,H11 Vascular endothelial damage in the cardiac allograft, perhaps beginning as early as at the time of donor brain death, may set up an inflammatory response that primes the endothelium for cumulative injury during the subsequent stages of ischemic cold storage,

thickening and infrequently are associated with thrombi. It is this aspect of accelerated coronary artery disease that is most prevalent and most insidious.O6 Small vessels of the coronary tree, 100 µm or less, are usually not involved.D1 By angiographic assessment, the incidence of allograft coronary artery disease has been estimated at 10% to 15% per year, with a prevalence of about 50% by 5 years after transplantation.G3 Freedom from mild, moderate, and severe coronary artery disease over 5 years in a large cohort of patients in the 1990s is depicted in Fig. 21-25. B26

Coronary artery disease in the transplanted heart has decreased over time,A11 even though more than 70% of patients remain on adrenocorticosteroids 4 years after transplantation.G3 This is attributed in part to a decrease in incidence of rejection and death resulting from rejection. Graft coronary artery disease appears to be reduced by better immunosuppression regimens.A11 It has also been suggested that coronary artery disease may have been stabilized or retarded by use of diltiazem, other medications to control hypertension (which occurs in 67% by 1 year), and lipidlowering agents for control of hyperlipidemia (which occurs in 39% by 1 year and 41% by 4 years).G3

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is often used as a palliative intervention, with midterm results similar to those of the nontransplant population for more proximal and discrete lesions. Multiple PCI procedures are often necessary as the disease progresses, and atherectomy and intracoronary stents are increasingly applied to allograft vasculopathy.C18,V4 Coronary artery bypass grafting has a limited role, except with left main or isolated proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis. With diffuse and severe coronary involvement, retransplantation is the best option to prolong survival (see "Retransplantation" later in this section).

## Other Complications

## *Renal Dysfunction*

Renal dysfunction following cardiac transplantation has two distinct manifestations: acute posttransplant renal failure and chronic renal dysfunction. Acute renal failure generally occurs in the setting of reduced renal reserves before transplant (generally associated with a glomerular filtration rate < 50 mL·min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in the adult) with superimposed early graft dysfunction or introduction of posttransplant calcineurin inhibition with either cyclosporine or tacrolimus. Initial administration of cyclosporine or tacrolimus can induce a rapid and intense vasoconstriction of preglomerular afferent arterioles, which is likely mediated by an increase in sympathetic tone, activation of the renin-angiotensin system, decreased production of vasodilator molecules, and increased production of vasoconstrictor molecules.I1,R6 Initial vasoconstriction results in a decrease of renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, both of which are dose related and reversible. Specific vasoconstrictors linked to cyclosporine administration include endothelin and thromboxane.

Chronic renal dysfunction following cardiac transplantation is primarily related to chronic administration of either cyclosporine or tacrolimus. Data from the ISHLT Heart and Lung Registry indicate that approximately 20% of patients have renal dysfunction at 1 year, and 25% of patients exhibit important renal dysfunction by 4 years.A11 At 4 years, about 7% of patients have a serum creatinine level greater than 2.5 mg·dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , and about 2% are on chronic dialysis.V2 Proximal tubular cells appear susceptible to injury from calcineurin inhibitors, induced by either sustained ischemia secondary to drug-related vasoconstriction or direct toxic effects of cyclosporine on tubular cells.C2 These effects promote the influx of inflammatory cells into the interstitium, with resultant fibroblast proliferation and chronic scar formation. The afferent arteriolar lesions associated with cyclosporine or tacrolimus affect not only the glomeruli, but also tubules and interstitium.A2,A3,H14

Treatment of persisting renal dysfunction (serum creatinine > 2 mg·dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) should include reducing levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus to the lowest levels consistent with freedom from rejection. Patients with important renal dysfunction who have a history of minimal allograft rejection should be considered for conversion to a sirolimus-based immunosuppressive regimen, which may have a renal-sparing effect if initiated before renal dysfunction is progressive. However, conversion from cyclosporine or tacrolimus late in the progression of renal dysfunction rarely reverses renal damage. When chronic dialysis is required, consideration for renal transplantation is advisable if allograft function is good and other nonrenal subsystems are intact.

## *Glucose Intolerance*

Hyperglycemia is the direct result of adrenocorticosteroid use for immunosuppression. Reducing or eliminating corticosteroids is the most helpful intervention. Glucose intolerance is also a common complication of tacrolimus therapy. It may be necessary to use oral hypoglycemic medications and occasionally begin insulin therapy in some patients.

## *Hypertension*

Hypertension occurs in 70% to 90% of patients on cyclosporine immunosuppression. Occurrence of hypertension is somewhat less (30%-50%) when tacrolimus is used. Its relationship to renal insufficiency and graft arteriosclerosis is not known. Blood pressure consistently measured in excess of 140/90 mmHg should be treated. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or calcium channel blockers are employed in conventional doses. Use of ACE inhibitors may have an additive effect with cyclosporine or tacrolimus to cause hyperkalemia. Calcium channel blockers decrease metabolism of cyclosporine and must be used judiciously and with monitoring of cyclosporine levels and appropriate dose adjustment. Diuretics may also be used in addition to primary antihypertensives. Other medications may be required in combination for patients not controlled by ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers.

#### *Hyperlipidemia*

Hyperlipidemia is common after cardiac transplantation and requires treatment in about 50% of patients.G6 An abnormal lipid profile has been associated with increased risk of coronary events.D5 Diet and exercise pattern modification are firstline treatments of abnormal lipid metabolism. Reduction of prednisone dose is helpful. Total cholesterol level greater than 220 mg·dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol greater than 120 mg·dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> should be treated using a statin drug such as lovastatin; 10 mg daily is the usual starting dose, recognizing that in combination with cyclosporine, there is increased risk of rhabdomyolysis.

#### *Osteoporosis*

Osteoporosis begins before operation in patients having cardiac transplantation and may be due to their prolonged inactivity or prolonged use of heparin.G7 Corticosteroid administration in the form of high-dose prednisone accelerates the problem after transplantation. Bone loss is greatest in the lumbar vertebrae and is rapid during the first 6 months. Vertebral compression fractures may result from this bone loss. Aseptic necrosis of the femoral head has also been noted. Patients at high risk should be treated before transplantation. High-risk factors for osteoporosis include female gender, older age, white or Asian race, thin or small body frame, prolonged immobility, early menopause (<40 years), postmenopause, glucocorticosteroid use, family history, low calcium intake or deficiency, excessive alcohol or caffeine intake, tobacco use, scoliosis, and use of a variety of drugs commonly taken by patients waiting for cardiac transplantation, including furosemide, warfarin, and heparin. Postmenopausal women are given estrogen replacement. Calcium salts (calcium carbonate 1000 to 2000 mg·day<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) and calcitrol beginning at 0.25 µg every other day and increasing to 0.5 µg·day<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> are given before transplant and thereafter. Calcitrol (10 mg daily) may also increase bone density.G12

## *Biliary Disease*

Biliary disease can affect as many as 8% of patients after cardiac transplantation, a prevalence 17 times higher than in the general population.V3 Increased risk of cholelithiasis is explained by reduced gallbladder emptying related to vagotomy and use of cyclosporine, which is both cholestatic and cholelithogenic. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy solves this problem and is well tolerated.

## Cardiac Retransplantation

There is general agreement that survival after retransplantation is inferior to that following primary transplantation.J5 Risk factors for death include early retransplantation (within 6 months of primary transplant) and retransplantation for acute rejection or early allograft failure. The incidence of infection and rejection are similar following primary transplant and retransplantation.

## Cardiac Function and Quality of Life

## *Cardiac Function*

Successful cardiac transplantation allows dramatic functional improvement in most patients with advanced heart failure. The cardiac allograft affords profound circulatory rehabilitation that is often immediately apparent. Yet cardiac allografts do not function normally, even though more than 90% of surviving recipients have no activity limitation.H14 In the absence of recurring rejection, important allograft vasculopathy, or poorly controlled hypertension, the transplanted heart performs at rest in a similar (although not identical) manner as a healthy age- and sex-matched normal heart, but major physiologic abnormalities manifest during exercise.

Multiple factors contribute to reduced exercise reserves. Normal heart cardiectomy for transplantation severs both afferent and efferent nervous system connections. Afferent denervation affects sensory receptors in the cardiopulmonary region that exert a tonic restraining influence on sympathetic outflow to the heart and peripheral circulation.A4 Absence of these afferent fibers in the transplanted heart produces a reduced augmentation of peripheral vascular resistance and blunted plasma norepinephrine response to an abrupt decrease in central venous pressure (circulating blood volume).M15,T5 Afferent nervous pathway interruption also impairs renninangiotensin-aldosterone regulation, which normally acts to decrease renin antidiuretic hormone secretion when blood volume is increased.G6,G8 Interruption of these afferent neural fibers results in a loss of this feedback mechanism, which normally counterbalances sympathetic renal stimulation. Chronically increased stimulation of the rennin-angiotensinaldosterone axis creates a chronic volume-expanded state. The general decrease in vagal inhibitor effect on sympathetic output may also aggravate the hypertensive tendency after transplantation.S5

#### **Box 21-23** Mechanisms for Increasing Cardiac Output in the Transplanted Heart

- Increased venous return during initial exercise is accompanied by increased ventricular end-diastolic pressure volume and stroke volume (Starling mechanism)
- Increased circulating adrenal catecholamines produce increased heart rate and contractility
- Increased heart rate contributes to increased cardiac output
- Increased heart rate leads to increased contractility (Bowditch effect)
- Release of atrial natriuretic peptide promotes arteriolar vasodilatation (decreased systemic vascular resistance)

From Kirklin and colleagues.K14

Efferent innervation mediates sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system on the heart directly. Eliminating the vagal-mediated parasympathetic influences results in a higher than normal resting heart rate. Loss of autonomic signaling from the CNS also attenuates the usual rapid changes in heart rate and contractility normally noted during exercise. Hypovolemia or peripheral vasodilatation in the transplanted patient results in less compensatory autonomic adrenergic effects on cardiac action.

Intrinsic myocardial contractility remains unaffected by denervation, but diastolic compliance is typically somewhat impaired.Y4 Diastolic dysfunction early after transplantation is common, but usually resolves over time.S17 Occasionally an occult restrictive hemodynamic state may persist permanently and is identifiable in 10% to 15% of long-term survivors, particularly in the presence of recurrent cellular rejection.G13,V1 Diastolic dysfunction during exercise, although usually not progressive, can be documented in most transplanted hearts.B21 Mechanisms for increasing cardiac output in the transplanted heart (Box 21-23) allow most transplant recipients to engage in essentially all physical activities, especially after proper training.

#### *Quality of Life*

Cardiac transplantation produces prompt and sustained improvement in the health status and perception of general well-being among most patients with advanced heart failure. The effect of cardiac transplantation on quality of life during the first 5 years has been examined in all four of its major domains (Table 21-18).

## INDICATIONS FOR ADULT CARDIAC TRANSPLANTATION

In the final analysis, cardiac transplantation is advisable if the expected survival, quality of life, and functional outcomes are superior to other therapeutic options for advanced heart failure. The generally accepted indications for adult cardiac transplantation are listed in Box 21-24.

Heart transplantation is recommended for selected patients with advanced heart failure whose life expectancy with medical or other surgical therapies is less than 50% at 2 years. Rarely, cardiac transplantation is recommended for patients with longer expected survival but whose quality of life related to the heart failure syndrome is particularly poor despite optimal medical or surgical therapies.

#### **Donor Allocation**

Cardiac transplantation should be reserved for those patients most likely to benefit in terms of both life expectancy and quality of life. When allocating a scarce resource such as a donor heart, a balance must be achieved between appropriate use of the resource to maximize graft survival and maximizing patient survival in those with the poorest expected outcome with other available therapies.

The stated goals of organ allocation embrace two basic concepts: fairness and utility. The concept of fairness is complex, but basically states that all patients with end-stage heart disease of equivalent severity have an equal chance of obtaining a heart transplant. Unfortunately, quantifying the probability of death for various patient subsets is currently not possible, and specific criteria for listing are not uniform among institutions.

The concept of utility must also be considered in judging any allocation algorithm. This concept embodies the notion that a precious resource like transplant organs should be used to maximally extend life. Inherent is the notion that transplantation should only be offered to patients for whom transplantation would substantially and importantly improve survival over other therapeutic options. Thus, if likely duration of survival is importantly reduced by the presence of major noncardiac organ dysfunction or comorbidities (which would either be unaffected or worsened by therapies required following transplantation), then the utility of transplantation would be unfavorable.

Based on these concepts, national organ procurement agencies establish algorithms for selecting recipients when an organ donor is identified. In the United States, this agency is the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), which includes committees of transplant experts who work together to establish the rules for organ allocation.

The current allocation system in the United States gives strong priority to those patients whose heart failure is severe enough to require continuous inotropic therapy or mechanical circulatory support. Because of poor survival in higher-risk subsets and paucity of available organs, current indications for cardiac retransplantation are generally limited to (1) chronic severe cardiac allograft vasculopathy with symptoms of ischemia or heart failure or asymptomatic moderate or severe left ventricular dysfunction, and (2) chronic graft dysfunction with symptoms of progressive heart failure in the absence of active rejection. T3

#### SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

#### Cardiac Transplantation for Cardiac Neoplasm

Complete excision of cardiac sarcoma or other cardiac neoplasm may be difficult to achieve because of anatomic location. Resection of the entire heart and orthotopic cardiac transplantation have been described for treating an otherwise unresectable cardiac tumor. Cardiac explantation, extracorporeal resection of the tumor with cardiac reconstruction, and cardiac autotransplantation are described in Chapter 18.

Another approach to consider for these patients is cardiectomy and replacement with total artificial heart, either as a permanent implant or as a bridge to transplantation after several months, to determine freedom from metastatic disease (see Chapter 22).

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>a</sup>Based on responses from quality of life questionnaires

## Cardiac Xenotransplantation

The continuing shortage of cardiac allografts has focused attention and research on using a species other than human as a source of hearts for transplantation. Adams and colleagues reviewed past clinical experience with cardiac xenotransplantation, including the highly publicized Baby Fae transplant performed by Bailey in 1984 (baboon to human) and the xenotransplant reported by Czaplicki in 1992 (pig to man after cross-circulation removal of preformed antibodies).A7 They concluded that improved understanding of the immunologic barriers to cross-species transplantation has narrowed the gap between laboratory research and clinical application.A7

Hearts from nonprimates are destroyed within minutes after transplantation into humans because of hyperacute rejection by expression of α-galactose disaccharide (Gal) carbohydrate on vascular endothelium. Humans have circulating natural antibodies against this antigen. Once anti-Gal antibodies bind to the xenograft, the complement cascade is activated, triggering endothelial cell dysfunction, platelet aggregation, and vascular thrombosis, referred to as *acute vascular rejection*. P6 In addition, there is absence of complement regulatory proteins and mechanisms to control complement activation in xenografts. Donor organs from primates do not express Gal on the endothelium and thus do not undergo hyperacute rejection in human recipients. Rejection, however, occurs within days to weeks after transplantation. Research in developing transgenic pigs has been directed toward genetically altered animals that express human complement regulatory proteins (CRP)M14 and down-regulation of Gal expression on the porcine endothelium.S3 Recipient strategy research has been focused on reduction of anti-Gal circulating antibody levels using extracorporeal immunoadsorption, IV injection of Gal carbohydrates to bind and neutralize circulating natural antibodies, and total lymphoid irradiation or porcine bone marrow transplantation to induce tolerance.

A number of scientific and ethical obstacles remain. Even though primate transplantation is not accompanied by hyperacute rejection, these grafts ultimately fail by acute vascular rejection, a process that is poorly understood. There are no effective therapies to control acute xenograft vascular rejection, but the complex immunologic responses are being elucidated and may allow development of specific therapeutic strategies to prevent xenograft rejection.L4 Animal rights issues have moved xenograft transplant away from primate donors toward transgenic pig donors, which seems to cause less public disfavor, presumably because pigs have been domesticated for dietary consumption, can be grown to appropriate size, and have been used for other medical purposes.A10 Xenosis, the possible transmission of infectious diseases from animal to human,F4 could in turn expose the general population to disease previously unknown to humans. This threat is not easily dismissed. Porcine endogenous retroviruses are particularly important because these viruses have been shown to infect human cells in vitro. No human disease, however, has yet to be associated with these viruses.

Cardiac xenotransplantation remains a dream, but the goal may eventually be achieved.P6 It is anticipated that initial clinical experiments will be as bridge to allotransplantation and probably will be applied as a heterotopic placement of the graft.

## **Section II Cardiac Transplantation for Congenital Heart Disease and Pediatric Patients**

## HISTORICAL NOTE

On December 6, 1967, 3 days after Christiaan Barnard performed the first human-to-human heart transplant, Adrian Kantrowitz performed the second, in Brooklyn, New York, for an 18-day-old neonate with Ebstein anomaly, refractory heart failure, and previous aortopulmonary shunt for severe cyanosis.K3 The donor was an anencephalic infant. The recipient died 5 hours after the transplant of heart failure and refractory acidosis. Bailey and colleagues at Loma Linda transplanted a baboon heart into a newborn infant, "Baby Fae," with hypoplastic left heart syndrome on October 26, 1984. The baby survived 20 days.B1,B2 This single experience renewed intense scientific interest in the possibility of xenotransplantation, while at the same time arousing intense public debate over the issue of primate donors for human transplantation. Ironically, the Baby Fae experience did not lead to another cardiac xenotransplant procedure in the coming decade, but it did signal the emergence of neonatal heart transplantation as an option for end-stage neonatal heart disease. Over the following decade, the Loma Linda group generated a landmark experience with superb survival after infant cardiac transplantation.

## CLINICAL FEATURES

Many clinical features noted for adult cardiac transplantation (see Section I) pertain to young patients with some exceptions.

## Infant ABO-Incompatible Heart Transplants

Infants in the first few months of life manifest a deficiency in certain types of B-cell responses. Although such responses to protein antigen stimulation are generally competent early in life, antibody production to T-independent carbohydrate antigens is notably deficient.F5,W10 This finding is particularly relevant to development of natural antibodies directed against nonself A or B blood group antigens. Available evidence suggests that these natural ABO antibodies develop as a crossreaction to similar carbohydrate epitopes on intestinal *Escherichia coli* in normal gut flora.S13 This deficiency in the ability to produce antibodies against carbohydrate antigens is manifest during early infancy by the absence of natural anti-A or anti-B blood group antibodies until approximately age 4 to 6 months.F5

The paucity of available donors for neonates and small infants requiring cardiac transplantation and this relative neonatal immune deficiency stimulated West and colleagues in Toronto to consider the possibility of ABO-incompatible cardiac transplantation to expand the donor pool for neonatal transplantation.W10 In 2001, they reported successful application of this strategy in 6 infants who received ABOincompatible hearts.W9 Most underwent transplantation before onset of isohemagglutinin anti-A or anti-B antibody production. Standard immunosuppressive strategies were used, and hyperacute rejection was not observed. For those patients in whom anti-ABO antibodies were detected, plasma exchange was performed during CPB.F6

Successful application of ABO-incompatible neonatal and infant heart transplantation has now been adopted by many pediatric transplant centers worldwide, with over 80 ABOincompatible infant heart transplantations reported, and survival equal to ABO-compatible transplantation.R1,W8

## TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

For certain forms of congenital heart disease, special adaptations of basic techniques of transplantation discussed in Section I are necessary to accommodate anatomic variations. These are described separately. If the bicaval technique is used, it is important to avoid excessive redundancy in creating the new superior vena cava (SVC) because any kinking of the caval pathway can result in a venous pressure gradient. In small infants and children, a beveled anastomosis is recommended to minimize narrowing at the suture line with growth.

In general, mean systemic perfusion pressure should be maintained at 40 mmHg or greater during rewarming after heart transplantation with a perfusion flow rate of 2.5 to 3.0 L·min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ·m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> in pediatric patients.

## Venous Cannulation

In the presence of multiple previous operations and difficult venous cannulation, some surgeons prefer to use initial cannulation of the right atrium and subsequent direct venous cannulation while cooling, particularly if a left SVC is present. Individual caval cannulation eliminates the need for prolonged periods of circulatory arrest during transplantation. In patients with separate hepatic drainage, these veins are allowed to drain directly into the pericardium for collection by a cardiotomy sucker. Care must be taken to avoid obstructing hepatic venous drainage by a snare around the inferior vena cava (IVC). In patients with heterotaxy syndrome and azygos continuation of the IVC, the right and left hepatic veins often drain separately, and it is important to leave a cuff of atrium around the entrance of the hepatic veins to facilitate connection of the right atrium to the donor graft.

## Arterial Cannulation

In neonates with hypoplastic left heart syndrome the pulmonary trunk and ductus are commonly cannulated, but an attractive alternative is to use a 3.5-mm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft sewn onto the brachiocephalic artery. This permits regional cerebral circulation while implanting the donor aorta, avoiding periods of circulatory arrest. A flexible wire-reinforced cannula is desirable for arterial cannulation whenever arch reconstruction is required, because the cannula can be positioned away from the operative field (see "Arterial Cannulation" in Chapter 2).

#### Malpositions of the Aorta

In patients with a malposed ascending aorta or transposed great arteries, the ascending aorta may be distinctly leftward and relatively short compared with a normal dextropositioned aorta. The pulmonary trunk is often posterior and rightward. However, at the pericardial reflection the aorta usually assumes a position anterior and to the right of the pulmonary trunk. These malpositions are most easily addressed by harvesting from the donor an extended length of the aorta including the arch and pulmonary artery, including the bifurcation, and extensively separating and mobilizing the ascending aorta from the recipient's pulmonary trunk. This allows a gentle arch of donor ascending aorta to overlie the pulmonary trunk reconstruction, with an anastomosis near the native brachiocephalic artery. The native pulmonary trunk can be partially or completely oversewn and an incision extended into the left pulmonary artery to create an anatomic position suitable for connection with the donor pulmonary trunk.

## Anomalies of Systemic Venous Return

*Left Superior Vena Cava Draining to Coronary Sinus*

When the left SVC drains to the coronary sinus, the simplest approach is to leave it attached to the atrium and preserve the course and connection of the coronary sinus to the right atrium at cardiectomy (Fig. 21-26). If a biatrial transplant is selected, care must be taken to avoid narrowing the coronary sinus by the left atrial anastomosis. In the presence of a diminutive or absent right-sided SVC, this method of reconstruction may prevent endomyocardial biopsy via the left SVC because of the sharp angulation required for the bioptome to access the right ventricular septum.

If the left SVC empties directly into the upper corner of the left atrium, and if there is a communicating vein to the right SVC, consideration should be given to ligating it at its entry into the left atrium. However, in general it is advisable to preserve all avenues of venous drainage. To maximize surgical options during implantation, the maximal length of

donor SVC and brachiocephalic vein should be harvested. An extracardiac reconstruction can be accomplished by anastomosing the donor brachiocephalic vein to the cut end of the recipient left SVC, followed by a direct right SVC anastomosis to donor right SVC (Fig. 21-27).

Alternatively, an intracardiac pathway can be constructed using the recipient's left atrial appendage or PTFE to redirect drainage from the left SVC to the right atrium. The biatrial implantation technique is then employed, in which the left atrial and right atrial septal anastomoses deviate slightly leftward at the opening of the left SVC tunnel into the new right atrium. This technique may be less prone to kinking and thrombosis than the extracardiac reconstruction (Fig. 21-28).

## Anomalies of Inferior Vena Caval Drainage

Anomalies of systemic venous drainage are common. Separate drainage of the hepatic veins to the left atrium requires creating a baffle within the left atrium to divert left hepatic drainage back to the right atrium (Fig. 21-29). The baffle must be positioned in a manner that avoids pulmonary venous obstruction. PTFE or pericardium is convenient for constructing this tunnel. A bicaval or biatrial implantation technique can then be used (see Section I).

## Anomalies of Pulmonary Veins and Atrial Septum

In the presence of uncorrected partial or total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, standard transplant procedures must be modified (see Section I). In the presence of anomalous connections of the right upper pulmonary veins to the SVC, a recommended option is to use a modification of the Warden procedure, in which the SVC is divided and oversewn just cephalad to the pulmonary veins, and the septum is excised along with the explanted heart. The left atrial incision is fashioned to include the right atrial wall at its junction with the SVC. The entrance of the anomalous pulmonary vein is then incorporated with the left atrial

anastamosis. The donor SVC is then anastomosed end to end to the recipient's SVC.

In the presence of previous Mustard or Senning procedures (see Chapter 52) the entire interior baffle is removed and the interatrial septum reconstructed with PTFE in preparation for a biatrial connection. Alternatively, the venae cavae can be divided at their connection to the native heart and a bicaval implantation performed.

## Complex Combinations of Anomalous Systemic and Pulmonary Venous Drainage

In the setting of multiple previous operations and unexpected anomalies of pulmonary or systemic venous return, little or no native tissue may be available for reconstruction. Any anomalous locations of entry into the atrial mass can be managed expeditiously by cutting the ventricular mass off the underlying atria, leaving all available atrial tissue in place while the surgeon assesses reconstructive options. Any interatrial septum is excised, leaving a "common atrium." Any systemic venous opening to the left of the midportion of the open atria can be moved to the midline and repartitioned or tunneled with PTFE patch material so as to drain to the right side. Any pulmonary veins entering to the right of a midatrial (interatrial) septum can be repartitioned with a patch of PTFE that replaces part or all of the septum, such that there is a cut edge of PTFE partition (septum) near the midportion of the atria. The pulmonary veins drain under this partition to the left side of the atria. Then, a standard orthotopic implantation method can be used in which a newly created edge of atrial "septum" is available for the left and right atrial "septal" suture lines, such that all pulmonary venous blood drains to the left side, and all systemic venous blood drains to the right side.

## Dextrocardia

In patients with isolated dextrocardia, in which the apex of the ventricles is rightward with atrial situs solitus, orthotopic cardiac transplantation can usually be performed in standard fashion. There may be rotation of the great vessels, but extensive mobilization of the aorta and pulmonary trunk allows rather standard anastomoses for the transplanted heart. Occasionally, secondary to limited space available on the left side of the pericardium, the left pleural space can be widely opened and the diaphragmatic pericardial attachments taken down partially on the left side to accommodate the apex of the transplanted heart.

#### Situs Inversus

Situs inversus is a unique surgical challenge because of the need to reroute systemic and pulmonary pathways and reposition the great vessels. Management of the great vessels is accomplished as discussed under "Malpositions of the Aorta" earlier in this section. Reconstruction of the systemic venous and pulmonary venous pathways can be accomplished using either the biatrial or bicaval technique.

The simplest method uses a bicaval technique in which the pulmonary vein orifices and the posterior aspect of the left atrium are isolated as a single unit with a circumferential cuff of left atrium, just as in a standard bicaval technique. Incisions in the left-sided right atrium are planned such that autologous right atrial tissue can be used to construct a partial tube from the left-sided opening of the IVC rightward along the diaphragm to provide a connection with the donor IVC opening within the right atrium.

In the presence of a normal brachiocephalic vein, a long segment of donor SVC and brachiocephalic vein is harvested to allow a right-sided anastomosis from donor SVC to the underside of the recipient brachiocephalic vein. Alternatively, the donor SVC and brachiocephalic vein can be anastomosed directly to the mobilized recipient left SVC (Fig. 21-30).

![](_page_46_Picture_10.jpeg)

The general sequence of operation is transection of the SVC, including a small rim of right atrium, followed by incision of all available right atrial tissue anteriorly to the tricuspid valve and posteriorly to the interatrial septum, which is left intact and in continuity with the IVC orifice. The great vessels are divided proximally, and the left atrium is incised and the cardiac mass excised, leaving a cuff of left atrium around all the pulmonary venous orifices. The great vessels are mobilized as described above. Native atrial tissue is used to construct a partial tube (using a Hegar dilator if needed) for the IVC that reaches beyond the lower right corner of the left atrial remnant. If insufficient pericardial space is available for the donor ventricular apex, the pericardial attachments to the diaphragm on the left side are partially taken down, avoiding injury to, or cautery close to, the phrenic nerve.

Implantation involves a standard left atrial anastomosis followed by the IVC anastomosis between the constructed tube and the donor IVC orifice. The donor and recipient aorta are then trimmed appropriately to provide a tensionfree anastomosis, after which de-airing and de-clamping are carried out as usual. The SVC reconstruction and pulmonary artery anastomosis (with an incision extended onto the left pulmonary artery as needed) are performed while rewarming.

Alternatively, a biatrial technique can be used by removing all interatrial septum and reconstructing the septum as described earlier in this section under "Complex Combinations of Anomalous Systemic and Pulmonary Venous Drainage*.*" Autologous tissues can also be used to create internal baffles to achieve the same result (Fig. 21-31).

## Pulmonary Arterial Anomalies

Distortion or hypoplasia of the central pulmonary arteries must be repaired at the time of transplantation to minimize obstruction to right ventricular outflow. Repair can usually be made by patch plasty with donor pulmonary artery tissue or by replacing the central pulmonary arteries with those of the donor. In more severe forms of pulmonary arterial anomalies, discontinuity of pulmonary arteries may occur as a result of previous systemic-to-pulmonary connections or cavopulmonary artery connections, or they may be congenitally discontinuous. In these instances, detailed preoperative angiography or computed tomographic angiography is important to delineate the size and distribution of the pulmonary arteries, extent and location of major aortopulmonary collateral arteries, and those specific areas of the pulmonary artery tree that will require reconstruction (see Section II in Chapter 38).

Management of aortopulmonary collaterals during CPB requires special planning. Because these collaterals markedly increase pulmonary venous return during bypass, they can complicate the conduct of the transplant procedure and produce important volume overload and distension of the new graft during reperfusion. In addition, excessive pulmonary blood flow may initiate pulmonary dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular dysfunction. For these reasons, coiling these vessels in the catheterization laboratory immediately prior to transplantation is preferable whenever possible. Alternatively, ligation of collaterals at transplantation may be accomplished by dividing the posterior pericardium following cardiectomy (see "Managing Sources of Pulmonary Blood Flow on Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Chapter 38).

When the pulmonary trunk requires replacement, it is advisable to perform this reconstruction before the aortic or SVC anastomosis (Fig. 21-32). After the left atrial connection is completed, the donor pulmonary arteries are connected to the recipient's pulmonary arteries, after which the aortic and cavocaval or right atrial anastomoses are completed.

## Anomalies of Aortic Arch

Residual or congenital defects of the aorta are often encountered, along with arch hypoplasia, interruption, or hypoplastic

![](_page_48_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 21-33** Orthotopic cardiac transplantation, hypoplastic left heart physiology. **A,** Common to the spectrum of hypoplastic left hearts is hypoplasia of left ventricle and ascending aorta. Ductus arteriosus continues to descending thoracic aorta. Pulmonary trunk is usually large. **B,** Cardiectomy proceeds in classic fashion, retaining most of right and left atria of recipient to allow standard large atrial anastomoses, because these patients are all infants. Ascending aorta is excised and aortic arch opened along its inferior wall into descending thoracic aorta. Ductus arteriosus is removed and its pulmonary end oversewn. **C,** Left and right atria are anastomosed in biatrial rather than bicaval fashion to permit better growth of anastomoses. Pulmonary trunk is anastomosed in end-to-end fashion. Ascending aorta and arch of donor are used to enlarge hypoplastic structures of recipient.

left heart syndrome. In patients with aortic arch hypoplasia, such as in hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the donor aorta can be used to replace a small ascending aorta and augment a hypoplastic aortic arch. In such instances, it is important to obtain as much of the donor aortic arch as possible, preferentially well into the descending thoracic aorta.

In the presence of residual coarctation, reconstruction optimally involves resecting the coarctation segment and anastomosis of the back wall of the transverse aortic arch to the descending aorta, followed by anterior augmentation with the donor aorta (see Technique of Operation in Chapter 48). This provides the greatest freedom from late re-coarctation. In the setting of ascending aorta and arch replacement, it is surgically convenient to leave a stump of donor brachiocephalic artery available for arterial recannulation following implantation of the donor heart (unless initial cannulation was in the native brachiocephalic artery via a PTFE graft).

## Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome

Patients presenting with hypoplastic left heart physiology without prior palliation may have a spectrum of anomalies.

Common to all, however, is hypoplasia of the left ventricle and ascending aorta (Fig. 21-33). The aortic arch is also small in most cases, and there may be associated coarctation of the aorta. The right ventricle and pulmonary trunk are usually large, and the ductus arteriosus continues to the descending aorta. It must be identified relative to the left pulmonary artery. The right atrium may be enlarged from high pressure and flow through a patent foramen ovale. The SVC and IVC usually connect normally.

Although a major portion of the transplant operation for this condition has traditionally been performed during circulatory arrest, alternative strategies are available to minimize or eliminate circulatory arrest to reduce the potential for neurologic damage. Prior to CPB, a 3.5-mm PTFE graft is anastomosed to the brachiocephalic artery and clamped. The patient is heparinized, and CPB is initially established with the arterial cannula inserted into the PTFE tube and secured with silk ties (this is a standard technique used by some surgeons for first-stage palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome; see Technique of Operation in Chapter 49). A second arterial cannula is inserted into the distal pulmonary trunk and passed well into the ductus arteriosus for distal aortic perfusion. Upon initiating CPB, a snare is secured

around the ductus to exclude the pulmonary arteries from arterial perfusate inflow.

Bicaval venous cannulation is employed as for the standard biatrial implantation technique, although initial cannulation of the right atrium may be employed if there is hemodynamic instability prior to initiating CPB. The perfusate is cooled to bring the nasopharyngeal temperature to 14° to 16°C and bladder temperature to 18°C. During the cooling phase, the hypoplastic ascending aorta is clamped and the heart excised as for biatrial implantation. Once the target body temperatures are achieved, the perfusate temperature is set at 16° to 18°C and low-flow perfusion is established at 1.0 to 1.5 L·min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ·m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> for the remainder of the implantation.

The donor heart has been procured to include the entire aortic arch and some of the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic arch of the donor is tailored by excising approximately one fourth of the superior aspect of the aortic circumference, beginning distal to the take-off of the donor brachiocephalic artery. The length of donor aortic arch is then tailored to fit the aortic arch of the recipient.

The left atrial anastomosis is constructed with continuous 4-0 or 5-0 polypropylene suture as in the standard biatrial implantation. The perfusate flow is then reduced to about 0.5 L·min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ·m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and the recipient brachiocephalic artery clamped proximal to the PTFE graft to allow continuation of regional cerebral perfusion during arch implantation. The arterial cannula through the ductus is clamped and removed, and the ductus is ligated proximally and divided. Inferior traction on this ligature facilitates the arch reconstruction. The native aorta is divided near the brachiocephalic artery and the proximal ascending aorta remnant removed. The aortic arch is opened through its inferior aspect, extending the incision past the ductus into the upper portion of the descending thoracic aorta to encompass any coarcted segment. All ductal tissue in the upper descending thoracic aorta is removed.

The donor aortic arch is anastomosed to the recipient aortic arch with continuous 6-0 polypropylene suture. The most difficult portion of the repair is the anastomosis of the distal aortic arch of the donor to the apex of the aortotomy in the upper portion of the descending thoracic aorta of the recipient. Accuracy and complete hemostasis in this area are critical for two reasons. First, inclusion of residual ductal tissue or failure to extend the incision far enough distally could result in stenosis and recurrent coarctation; second, bleeding from this area can be difficult to control later. Exposure of this area is facilitated by placing a C-clamp on the distal aorta to prevent back bleeding, which can obscure the surgical field. Upon completion of the aortic reconstruction, CPB can be continued through the native brachiocephalic artery cannulation, or a cannula can be placed through the stump of the donor brachiocephalic artery for the remainder of the procedure. After de-airing the arch and heart, the suture lines are secured, and the aortic clamp is removed while suction is placed on the needle vent. During rewarming, the right atrial anastomosis and pulmonary trunk end-to-end anastomoses are constructed using 5-0 polypropylene suture.

## Transplant after Fontan Operation

These patients are often very ill, with ascites, malnutrition, and marked venous hypertension. Multiple prior sternotomies are the norm, and specific plans are essential for establishing CPB rapidly in the event of cardiac bleeding during sternotomy. Exposure of a femoral artery and vein is advisable if the patient is large enough for femoral cannulation. If percutaneous femoral cannulae are planned in the event of an emergency, the groin should be inspected for scars of previous cutdowns or multiple catheterization procedures. If scarring is present, surgical exposure of the femoral artery and vein are advisable, because passage of dilators over a guidewire in a previously operated groin can be difficult.

The bicaval technique is employed with direct caval venous cannulation. The SVC is detached from the pulmonary artery (prior bidirectional Glenn), and the right atrial or IVC connection to the pulmonary trunk or underside of the right pulmonary artery is disconnected. Defects in the pulmonary artery are preferably reconstructed with donor pulmonary artery tissue or thin bovine pericardium.

The reconstructive requirements are often such that maximal length of SVC and brachiocephalic vein (if a left SVC is present) should be harvested from the donor, along with sufficient length of pulmonary artery branches to meet the reconstructive needs of the recipient pulmonary arteries.

## SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

See Section I and Chapter 5.

#### Immunosuppression

Although cyclosporine remains the most commonly used anticalcineurin agent in adult heart transplantation, tacrolimus is the more common agent among pediatric patients (Box 21-25).

## Surveillance for Rejection

In neonates and infants undergoing cardiac transplantation, repeated surveillance of cardiac biopsies may not be feasible because of limitations of vascular access. In this age group, echocardiographic variables have been identified that are generally predictive of acute rejection.B23,C12,L6

## Infection Prophylaxis

Prevention of infection by active immunization is recommended for specific conditions, using killed vaccine only.C13 Recommended childhood immunizations are given in Table 21-19.

## RESULTS

Among pediatric patients, survival has progressively improved through the early part of the last decade (2000-2010), with less discernible survival improvement since then (Fig. 21-34).K7 Among patients who survive the first posttransplant year, late survival is clearly superior in those transplanted during the first year of life (Fig. 21-35). Survival is the same as in adult transplant recipients once the patient reaches about 11 years of age. Patients with congenital heart disease have approximately twice the risk of early mortality compared with cardiomyopathy patients.K7 The single greatest risk factor for early pediatric mortality is pretransplant support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, which increases

the risk nearly fivefold. Risk of early death appears to increase considerably and progressively with age less than about 1 year. However, among neonates who survive the first year, long-term survival is particularly favorable,K8 likely related to relative immaturity of their immune system at the time of transplant.

General survival and risk factors are similar for adult and pediatric heart retransplantation.

## INDICATIONS FOR PEDIATRIC CARDIAC TRANSPLANTATION

More than 80% of cardiac conditions leading to cardiac transplantation in the pediatric population are either cardiomyopathies or congenital heart disease, with congenital heart disease not amenable to correction or palliation now comprising approximately 40% of all pediatric listings for transplantation.K7

The congenital cardiac malformations considered for cardiac transplantation range from unrepaired complex disease in the newborn to repaired or palliated congenital heart disease with ventricular dysfunction in the adult.B22,B24,C9,W15,Z2 Cardiac transplantation is currently not recommended as routine primary therapy for any cardiac malformation, but severe coronary anomalies, cardiac valve regurgitation, or ventricular dysfunction can favor primary transplantation or referral after initial palliation in selected infants with complex congenital heart disease.

Among infants, hypoplastic left heart syndrome is currently treated at most institutions with staged operations in the Fontan pathway. In general, patients with this condition are referred for cardiac transplantation when right ventricular dysfunction or tricuspid regurgitation, or both, are severe either prior to or following initial surgical palliation. In older children and adolescents, failure of staged single-ventricle palliation is the most common form of congenital heart disease referred for cardiac transplantation (Table 21-20).

The relatively small number of pediatric patients who are referred for cardiac transplantation, and the variety of conditions that can progress to cardiac failure, have limited the ability to generate specific guidelines for transplant referrals (Box 21-26). Recent consensus guidelines from the American Heart AssociationC3 include the following recommendations for patients with cardiomyopathies or previously repaired congenital heart disease:

- A need for ongoing IV inotropic or mechanical circulatory support for poor ventricular function and low cardiac output
- Progressive deterioration of ventricular function or functional status despite optimal medical care with digitalis, diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and β-blockade
- Malignant arrhythmias or survival after arrhythmiainduced cardiac arrest unresponsive to medical treatment, catheter ablation, or an implantable cardioverterdefibrillator

#### **Box 21-26** Indications for Pediatric Cardiac Transplantation

- Complex congenital cardiac anomaly with progressive heart failure not amenable to conventional repair or palliation
- Infants, children, and adolescents: progressive deterioration in left ventricular ejection fraction or functional status despite optimal medical therapy, failure to grow secondary to advanced heart failure symptoms, or a progressive rise in pulmonary vascular resistance that would be expected to preclude transplantation at a later date

Modified from Renlund.R6

- Restrictive cardiomyopathy associated with reactive pulmonary hypertension
- Progressive pulmonary hypertension secondary to systemic ventricular failure that could preclude cardiac transplantation at a later date
- Growth failure secondary to severe heart failure unresponsive to conventional medical treatment
- Unacceptably poor quality of life secondary to heart failure
- Progressive deterioration in functional status or presence of certain high-risk conditions following the Fontan procedure

Certain situations specific to pediatric patients contraindicate cardiac transplantation, as recommended by the American Heart Association Council on Cardiovascular Disease in the YoungC3:

- Heart transplantation for pediatric heart disease is not efficacious when heart disease is associated with severe irreversible disease in other organ systems, or when it is part of a severe irreversible multisystemic disease process. Multiorgan transplantation may be considered.
- Orthotopic heart transplantation for pediatric heart disease is not efficacious when heart disease is associated

- with severe irreversible fixed elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance.
- Heart transplantation is not feasible in the presence of severe hypoplasia of the central pulmonary arteries or pulmonary veins.
- The limited supply of pediatric donors, especially infant donors, makes heart transplantation not a feasible standard therapy for any specific congenital heart lesion.

## **Section III Heart-Lung Transplantation**

## HISTORICAL NOTE

The first combined heart-lung transplant procedure was performed by Denton Cooley in Texas on September 15, 1969. The patient was a 2-month-old infant who survived only 14 hours. C. Walton Lillehei performed the same procedure in an adult patient in New York 3 months later, and that patient survived 8 days. After a sustained experimental investigation of heart-lung transplantation, Bruce Reitz and colleagues at Stanford performed the first successful combined procedure in 1981. Long-term survival became possible with the availability of cyclosporine, and the first successful series of patients undergoing heart-lung transplantation was published by Reitz and colleagues the following year.R5

## CLINICAL FEATURES

## Recipient Evaluation and Selection

All the standard recipient selection criteria for isolated heart transplantation apply to patients considered for heart-lung transplantation. However, certain issues unique to this therapy require special mention. Because a heart-lung block is used that could otherwise potentially benefit three individuals with advanced heart or lung failure, there is an added responsibility to select heart-lung transplant recipients with sufficient overall reserves to both benefit from the procedure and have a good probability for midterm survival. In addition, the magnitude of heart-lung transplantation and the associated overall stress on other subsystems are, in most instances, greater than those for isolated heart or lung transplantation.

#### *Age*

A clear relationship between death after heart-lung transplantation and older age has not been formally demonstrated, but recipients older than age 60 are rarely selected.

## *Previous Thoracic Surgery*

Major bleeding from adhesions in a previously operated thoracic space is a strong risk factor for morbidity and mortality after heart-lung transplantation. This in part relates to major transfusion requirements, potentially destabilizing effects of ongoing bleeding on cardiac function immediately after transplantation, and difficulties in identifying and preserving the phrenic nerves in the presence of dense adhesions. As a result, some centers decline patients for heart-lung transplantation if they have undergone prior thoracotomy, particularly if bilateral. With experience, patients with prior thoracotomy and sternotomy can safely undergo heart-lung transplantation (see Technique of Operation), but they should have well-preserved noncardiac organ function and be younger, generally less than age 50 years.

## TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

## Preoperative and Intraoperation Preparation

Preoperative preparation for heart-lung transplantation is the same as for orthotopic heart transplantation. In the setting of no prior cardiothoracic operation, the procedure is performed through a median sternotomy. However, when one or both pleural spaces have been previously entered, a bilateral anterior thoracotomy is preferred as in the technique of bilateral lung transplantation. This allows safer dissection and control of bleeding from adhesions in both pleural spaces. A pericardial flap is developed by incising the pericardium laterally and inferiorly, leaving about 5 cm of pericardium over the superior vena cava as the base for an autologous pericardial flap to be placed around the tracheal anastomosis. Cautery must be avoided in the vicinity of either phrenic nerve, because heat-transmitted injury would catastrophically impair postoperative pulmonary function.

## Removal of Native Heart and Lungs

CPB is established, the aorta clamped, and a standard cardiectomy performed as for bicaval orthotopic cardiac transplantation (see "Orthotopic Cardiac Transplantation" under Technique of Operation in Section I). If pulmonary venous return is excessive, appropriate reduction of perfusate temperature to profound hyperthermic levels is instituted to allow intermittent low-flow perfusion to facilitate dissection and avoid excessive blood loss (see Section IV of Chapter 2). Otherwise, perfusate temperature is generally 28°C.

Beginning on the left side, an incision is made in the pericardium just anterior to the pulmonary veins as far below the phrenic nerve as possible. In the absence of dense adhesions, a pedicle of pericardium containing the phrenic nerve is developed inferiorly almost to the diaphragm and superiorly just to the level of the left pulmonary artery to avoid damaging the phrenic nerve. The left atrium is divided posteriorly in its midportion, and a cuff of left atrium along with the left pulmonary veins is dissected free and passed under the pericardial pedicle (Fig. 21-36, *A*). The left pulmonary artery is dissected circumferentially proximal to its branches and divided. The lower lobe of the left lung is reflected superiorly, and the inferior pulmonary ligament is divided with cautery. The posterior pulmonary attachments are divided, and the lung is mobilized away from the vagus nerve. The left mainstem bronchus is isolated by dividing lymphatic tissue with cautery and hemoclips, and the bronchus is stapled and divided. The left lung is passed off the surgical field.

Similarly, the pericardium on the right side is dissected immediately above the pulmonary vein, and the pericardial pedicle is mobilized. The inferior pulmonary ligament is mobilized, right pulmonary artery dissected circumferentially and divided, and posterior pulmonary attachments divided. The lung is gently freed from the area of the vagus nerve without cautery, and the right mainstem bronchus is isolated,

![](_page_53_Picture_2.jpeg)

stapled, and divided. After removing both lungs, stumps of right and left pulmonary arteries are mobilized and the pulmonary trunk excised, leaving a generous cuff around the area of ligamentum arteriosum and left recurrent laryngeal nerve. The bronchial stumps are mobilized to the level of the carina with careful hemostasis of bronchial arteries (Fig. 21-36, *B*). Complete hemostasis is critical to achieve throughout the pleural space and mediastinum before implanting the heartlung block.

## Implantation of the Heart-Lung Block

The heart-lung block is prepared on a back table by dividing the donor trachea approximately 2 cm above the carina. It is important to leave the membranous portion slightly longer than the cartilaginous portion, because it tends to retract slightly after division. The anatomic position of each lung is beneath the pericardial pedicle on each side, but in the presence of dense adhesions from prior operation, both lungs can safely be placed anterior to the phrenic nerves, which avoids additional dissection. In that instance, the pulmonary veins are divided outside the pericardium leaving the intrapericardial pulmonary veins and posterior left atrial wall intact. This may, however, require additional mobilization of tissue anterior to the phrenic nerves to allow the lungs to sit nicely in each pleural space.

The tracheal anastomosis is facilitated by placing silk stay sutures on the donor trachea after dividing it just above the carina. It is important to avoid any additional dissection superior to the point of division in order to preserve all possible blood supply to the tracheal anastomosis. The anastomosis is constructed with continuous 3-0 polypropylene sutures in adults and 4-0 polypropylene sutures in children (Fig. 21-36, *C*). An air-tight anastomosis must be achieved without necrosis of the membranous portion and without turning excessive amounts of tissue into the tracheal lumen. The pericardium is wrapped around the trachea and sutured to the thick lymphatic tissue anterior to the suture line. Gentle inflation of the lung while immersing the tracheal anastomosis in saline allows validation of an air-tight suture line. During implantation of the heart-lung block, the organs are covered with ice slush to maintain topical hypothermia.

The inferior and superior vena caval and aortic anastomoses are constructed, as in the bicaval orthotopic heart transplant technique (see "Orthotopic Cardiac Transplantation" under Technique of Operation in Section I). During rewarming, after suture lines are completed, the lungs are gently ventilated, and CPB is discontinued as usual. Nitric oxide is used in the presence of any reperfusion-induced pulmonary hypertension.

## SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Posttransplant management is similar to that for heart transplantation, except for additional protocols to enhance pulmonary graft function. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is routinely performed in the operating room at the end of the procedure to clear any secretions and examine the tracheal anastomosis. It should be performed again just prior to extubation and as indicated thereafter.

Because of potential ischemia-reperfusion injury and lymphatic disruption, a reimplantation response—evidenced by pulmonary perihilar haziness on chest radiograph and increased oxygen requirement—is common 2 to 5 days following heart-lung transplantation. Diuresis and fluid restriction is the primary therapy. When this process persists 1 week or more, acute rejection should be considered, with transbronchial biopsy assessment of suspected rejection.

Current immunosuppression protocols for heart-lung transplantation are similar to those for isolated heart transplantation with the exception of the steroid protocol (see Box 21-7). Although unproven, higher-dose prednisone is considered deleterious to tracheal healing, and oral prednisone is initiated at a dose of about 0.4 mg· kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ·day<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> with a rapid taper.

Surveillance for and management of lung rejection includes the same protocols that have been established for isolated single and double lung transplantation.

## RESULTS

## Survival

Survival is generally inferior to isolated heart transplantation, with a 1-year survival of approximately 80% and 10-year survival of 30% to 40%. Early graft failure is the most common cause of death in the first month, and infection remains the major cause of mortality thereafter, accounting for approximately one third of deaths after the first month. As in isolated lung transplantation, bronchiolitis obliterans accounts for 20% to 40% of mortality observed after the first year.

## INDICATIONS FOR HEART-LUNG TRANSPLANTATION

The current general indications for heart-lung transplantation are (1) Eisenmenger syndrome with an uncorrected intracardiac defect, (2) uncorrectable congenital heart disease with atresia or diffuse severe hypoplasia of the pulmonary arteries and progressive heart failure, (3) coexistence of severe cardiopulmonary disease with advanced heart or lung failure, and (4) severe heart failure with left ventricular dysfunction and secondary pulmonary hypertension unresponsive to vasodilator therapy.

In the current era of limited donor availability combined with the success achieved in single and double lung transplantation, isolated lung transplantation is the preferred therapy for advanced lung failure associated with emphysema, usual interstitial pneumonitis, and suppurative lung disease, including cystic fibrosis. Primary pulmonary hypertension refractory to medical therapy is currently preferentially treated with bilateral lung transplantation instead of combined heartlung transplantation.

The natural history of Eisenmenger syndrome characterized by excessive muscularization of the pulmonary vasculature that results in marked irreversible elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance and reversal of a previously left-to-right shunt at the atrial, ventricular, or aortopulmonary level, resulting in right-to-left shunting and cyanosis has not been characterized well enough to allow data-driven decisions regarding timing of referral for heart-lung transplantation. The time course of deterioration in this condition is slow, with 25-year survival exceeding 40%.W7 In general, the timing of listing for heart-lung transplantation is based on:

- Worsening cyanosis
- Right ventricular failure—particularly with marked ascites and peripheral edema—that is unresponsive to diuretic therapy
- Worsening oxygen saturation, particularly once it reaches 60% with exertion
- Progressive fatigue and dyspnea, particularly if repeated phlebotomy is required

## **Section IV Heterotopic Heart Transplantation**

## DEFINITION

The term *heterotopic cardiac transplantation* is used to describe placing the heart in a nonanatomic position (as opposed to the orthotopic or normal anatomic position). Although this term when used in the clinical setting has become synonymous with intrathoracic placement of the donor heart in parallel with the native heart,R3 the terms "auxiliary" and "parallel" were used in the original publications of this technique. Heterotopic transplantation of the heart as an auxiliary pump was first described in the early 1960s.M7 Since that time, heterotopic transplantation has found divergent roles as an experimental model and in clinical practice.

## HISTORICAL NOTE

Heterotopic cardiac transplantation was first performed clinically in 1974 in South Africa, and it was used exclusively in Cape Town for many years.H8 A number of putative advantages of heterotopic transplantation over orthotopic transplantation were believed to justify this procedure:

- Support of a dysfunctional donor heart (due to a long ischemic time) by the native heart until donor heart recovery occursH8
- Management of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance with a heterotopic heart so that the native right ventricle can continue to support the right side of the circulation after transplantationB6
- Use of a small donor heart for a larger recipient
- Potential to function as a "built-in assist device" at the time of hemodynamically significant acute cardiac rejectionL9
- Support of the native heart with development of coronary vasculopathy, as protection against sudden cardiac death until retransplantation can be undertakenB5
- In the rare circumstances when native cardiac failure may result from a process such as acute myocarditis, for which there is potential for recovery and subsequent removal of the heterotopic transplant

The initial clinical experience of heterotopic cardiac transplantation in Cape Town included use of the donor heart purely for left ventricular assistance,B6 with the donor pulmonary trunk being anastomosed to the recipient right atrium for donor coronary sinus venous return. Heterotopic transplantation was subsequently altered in favor of biventricular support.N6 In 1983, Cooper and colleagues reported two patients who underwent heterotopic heart transplantation with donor heart ischemic times of 8 hours and nearly 13 hours, respectively, preserved with a portable hypothermic perfusion apparatus. Initial donor heart function was poor for approximately 20 hours, the circulation being supported by the recipient's own heart until the donor heart recovered.C15

## TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

## Donor Heart Procurement

The donor heart is procured in the standard way except that the entire ascending aorta and aortic arch are harvested. The orifices of the right pulmonary veins are oversewn with continuous 5-0 polypropylene suture. The inferior vena caval orifice is also oversewn, taking care to avoid impinging on the coronary sinus. The partition between the left superior and inferior pulmonary veins is excised and the incision extended slightly into the base of the left atrial appendage as necessary to create an opening as large as the mitral valve orifice. In addition, the entire superior vena cava and proximal brachiocephalic vein is harvested.

## Heterotopic Cardiac Transplantation

A standard median sternotomy is made in the recipient. The right pleural space is widely opened to accommodate the donor heart. The pericardium is opened in the midline, and a pericardial flap for support of the transplanted heart is fashioned by making two perpendicular incisions on the right side that stop approximately 2 cm from the phrenic nerve. Careful hemostasis of this flap is important because it is not accessible after the heart is implanted. Great care must be taken to avoid any coagulation near the phrenic nerve. Small bleeding points at the extent of these pericardial incisions should be controlled with fine polypropylene sutures.

CPB is established with separate caval cannulation and moderate hypothermic (25°-28°C) perfusion. Myocardial preservation of the native heart is extremely important because most of the pulmonary ventricular function will arise from the native right ventricle, and the native left ventricle may be required to contribute to systemic support early after transplant. The aorta is clamped and multidose cardioplegic techniques used for the native heart, as in standard cardiac operations (see Chapter 3). Intermittent topical cooling with cold saline is employed. A left atriotomy is made in the interatrial groove as for standard mitral valve surgery (see Chapter 11), except that the incision does not extend under the superior or inferior vena cava. The opening in the donor left atrium is anastomosed to the corresponding opening in the native left atrium using continuous 3-0 polypropylene suture.

The donor superior vena cava is then anastomosed end to side to the anterolateral aspect of the recipient superior vena cava near the junction of the native right subclavian and brachiocephalic veins. This anastomosis is constructed with continuous 5-0 polypropylene suture, and the opening should be as large as the circumference of the donor superior vena cava (Fig. 21-37, *A*). This will provide access for endomyocardial biopsies of the donor right ventricle. The donor aorta is then anastomosed end to side to the anterolateral aspect of the native aorta with continuous 4-0 polypropylene suture (Fig. 21-37, *B*). Air is thoroughly evacuated from both hearts, and the aortic clamp removed with the same attention to details of reperfusion as in orthotopic cardiac transplantation. While rewarming, the donor pulmonary artery is lengthened with an appropriate-sized woven collagen-impregnated polyester graft, which is then anastomosed end to side to the anterior aspect of the native pulmonary trunk (Fig. 21-37, *C*). The remainder of the operation is completed as usual, taking care to leave atrial and ventricular pacing wires on both native and transplanted hearts for use postoperatively if necessary.

Use of the direct superior vena caval connection simplifies passing an endomyocardial biopsy forceps into the donor right ventricle.A13,R7 Infection of the pulmonary artery conduit is a potential risk of heterotopic transplantation using this method, and this complication, requiring removal of the conduit and replacement with an aortic allograft, has previously been described.R2 An alternative technique involves ligation of donor superior vena cava and a direct connection between the donor pulmonary trunk and the recipient right atrium, which would receive coronary sinus return from the donor heart.

## SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Permanent anticoagulation is required after heterotopic cardiac transplantation, because the native heart is a source of thrombus that may be ejected through the native aortic valve. Despite adequate anticoagulation, systemic emboli can still occur.N2 Presence of a mechanical valve in the native heart increases risk of thrombosis and is regarded as a contraindication to heterotopic heart transplantation.

## INDICATIONS FOR HETEROTOPIC HEART TRANSPLANTATION

In the current era, there are two basic indications for heterotopic transplantation. First, this procedure should be considered when there is marked elevation of recipient pulmonary vascular resistance, with systolic pressure greater than about 60 mmHg and little or no pulmonary reactivity despite pharmacologic intervention. The situation is particularly dangerous for orthotopic transplantation if the pulmonary artery systolic pressure remains above 55 mmHg when the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is below about 20 mmHg. Second, heterotopic transplantation may be considered when the donor heart is from a considerably smaller donor than the recipient (in body surface area). The limits of safe orthotopic cardiac transplantation from a smaller donor into a larger recipient are not well established, but the risk is known to be increased when a smaller female heart is transplanted into a considerably larger male recipient,Y5 and probably from a smaller-sized young teenage donor into a larger adult male recipient. It should be emphasized that every effort should be made to find a suitable teenage recipient for a teenage donor before resorting to this extreme procedure in an adult recipient.
