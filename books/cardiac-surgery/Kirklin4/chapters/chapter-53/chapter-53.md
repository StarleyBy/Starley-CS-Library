#### **DEFINITION**

Double outlet right ventricle (DORV) is a congenital cardiac anomaly in which both great arteries arise wholly or in large part from the right ventricle. It is a type of ventriculoarterial connection (see "Cardiac Connections" under Terminology and Classification of Heart Disease in Chapter 1).

In this chapter, DORV with atrioventricular (AV) concordant connection is discussed in detail. DORV also occurs in other settings (Fig. 53-1), but when the AV connection is discordant, that becomes the surgically more important feature, and patients with this combination (commonly called congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries) are better considered along with others with AV discordant connection (see Chapter 55). DORV may also occur in patients with univentricular AV connections (see "Ventriculoarterial Connections" under Morphology in Chapter 56). It is a frequent occurrence in patients with atrial isomerism (see "Ventriculoarterial Connections" under Morphology in Chapter 58).

One or both great arteries may directly overlie the ventricular septal defect (VSD) and thus arise biventricularly. <sup>U1</sup> For purposes of categorization, the great artery so arising is assigned to the ventricle it overlies by more than 50% on morphologic examination. Thus, when one great artery arises wholly or nearly so from the right ventricle (RV) and the other more than 50% from it, the condition is termed *DOR V*. Uncommonly, both great arteries arise biventricularly in association with a doubly committed juxta-arterial VSD (see Chapter 35, Figs. 35-8 and 35-9). One option is to arbitrarily assign each great artery to the ventricle above from which more than 50% arises and categorize the anomaly accordingly; the alternative is to term the malformation *double outlet both ventricles*.

Tetralogy of Fallot is an entity characterized by a variable amount of dextroposition of the aorta. When the aorta arises more than 50% from the RV, the anomaly may be categorized as tetralogy of Fallot with DORV or as DORV with pulmonary stenosis. Edwards uses still different criteria for distinguishing between these two conditions. E1 Taussig-Bing heart (see description under Morphology later in this chapter) is an entity with variability in the origin of the pulmonary artery. This diagnosis may be made when the pulmonary artery arises wholly or nearly so from the RV (in which case, it is a type of DORV), equally from right and left ventricles, or more than 50% but not entirely from the left ventricle (LV; in which case, it is not a type of DORV). When it arises entirely

Key: *LA*, Left atrium; *LV*, left ventricle; *RA*, right atrium; *RV*, right ventricle.

or essentially so from the LV, the assignment is to transposition of the great arteries with VSD.

Because of this differing terminology, surgical reports must clearly describe the entities under discussion.

#### HISTORICAL NOTE

When Kirklin performed the first repair of DORV (which was of the simple type with a subaortic VSD) in May 1957 at the Mayo Clinic, the anomaly was virtually unknown, and the preoperative diagnosis was large VSD with high pulmonary blood flow. K Diagnosis was correctly made at operation, the term double outlet right ventricle or origin of both great vessels from the right ventricle coined in the operating room, position of the His bundle deduced, and intraventricular tunnel repair performed in much the same manner as is done today. K7 An identical sequence occurred at GLH in September 1958.<sup>B3</sup> Earlier, in 1952, Braun and colleagues reported what was clearly a case of DORV with pulmonary stenosis and used the phrase double outlet ventricle, but the title of their paper was confusing, and it escaped notice. B13 About the time of the first repair, the first morphologic paper with the title "Double Outlet Right Ventricle" was published by Witham<sup>W3</sup>; subsequently, other early descriptions of the morphology appeared. C2,E4,E5,N1 In 1963, Redo and colleagues also reported repair of this entity.<sup>R1</sup>

Taussig-Bing heart was described in 1949, but its place in the spectrum of DORV was not recognized until later. H3,N2,T1,V1 Many early papers understandably referred to it under the heading *Transposition*. A9,B5,C4 Lev and colleagues recognized it as a form of DORV with subpulmonary VSD. L4 They and earlier workers did not clearly state, however, that Taussig-Bing heart is different from the heart with classic DORV with

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>1</sup>The adjectives *left* and *right* used to modify atrium or ventricle mean *morphologically* left and right, respectively. Position of the chamber is referred to as *right-sided* or *left-sided*.

subaortic VSD, not only with respect to relationships of the VSD but also with respect to position and interrelations of great arteries and infundibular (outlet) septum.A4,A7,W2 Early reports of successful surgical treatment were published in 1967 and 1969.D1,H2 Other early reports were by Patrick and McGoon in 1968 and by Kawashima and colleagues in 1971.K3,P3

The other types of DORV with AV concordant connection began to be clarified in the classic paper by Lev and colleagues in 1972.L4 Successful correction of unusual forms was reported in the 1970s and early 1980s.K6,P6,S13

## MORPHOLOGY AND MORPHOGENESIS

Although controversies developed concerning categorization of hearts with DORV and their basic morphologic features, these are now straightforward because of numerous detailed morphologic and clinical studies. The basic categorization of Lev and colleagues forms the basis of most surgical thought about this anomaly, but the terms they used, such as "subaortic" and "subpulmonary," are relational ones.L4 Confusion arises when their terms are used as morphologic ones for actual location of the VSD (see "Location in Septum and Relationship to Conduction System" under Morphology in Section I of Chapter 35).

Actual categorization of DORV and related conditions (specifically, Taussig-Bing heart, transposition of the great arteries with VSD, and double outlet left ventricle) is less important than a generalized surgical plan for their management.S1 Even so, development of a valid body of knowledge concerning surgical methods and outcomes requires accurate categorization of morphologic details and other patient characteristics. Even with the goal of accurate morphologic categorization and description, problems remain. Although a *conus* (or *infundibulum*) is easy to define as the presence of muscle between a semilunar and AV valve, the muscle strip may vary from a few millimeters to a few centimeters wide. An aorta that is to the right and side by side with the pulmonary trunk may seem essentially normal in position to one observer or in D-malposition to another. These matters complicate categorization accuracy and precision.

## Morphogenesis

Complex categorization points to a unifying hypothesis of morphogenesis put forth in a series of papers by the Van Praaghs, summarized recently by Richard Van Praagh.V2 He hypothesizes that "the distal or subsemilunar part of the infundibulum or conus arteriosus performs an arterial switch during cardiogenesis," with the development stage similar to the Taussig-Bing heart. The developmental steps that avoid double outlet right ventricle relate to asymmetric conal free wall enlargement. Van Praagh proposes that failure of this morphologic step leads to such entities as double outlet right and left ventricle, various transposition entities, and isolated atrial and ventricular discordant connections.

#### Ventricular Septal Defect

The VSD is usually large, but in about 10% of cases it is smaller than the aortic root and flow restrictive.D1,L1,M2,M4,S4 It may be multiple; rarely, it is absent.A2,M7,S11

![](_page_2_Figure_11.jpeg)

**Figure 53-2** Autopsy specimen of simple double outlet right ventricle with subaortic ventricular septal defect *(VSD)*. There is a prominent subaortic conus and a well-developed infundibular septum separating pulmonary valve *(PV)* from aorta, tricuspid valve *(TV)*, and VSD. Key: *AR,* Aortic root (conus); *RT,* right. (From Kirklin and colleagues.K7)

In most DORV hearts, the VSD is conoventricular, lying between the limbs of the trabecula septomarginalis (TSM; septal band).C1,T1 However, such defects vary in their relationships with the great arteries. Therefore, the VSD is discussed in *relational categories*. A5,L4

## *Subaortic Ventricular Septal Defect*

The subaortic VSD and TSM lie more posteriorly in the ventricular septum than subpulmonary and doubly committed VSDs, and are tucked beneath the infundibular (conal) septum (Fig. 53-2). Distance between the VSD and aortic valve varies, depending on presence and length of the subaortic conus (infundibulum); this determines whether the aorta overrides the VSD and hence whether the VSD is juxtaaortic.

When there is aortic-mitral fibrous continuity, absence of a subaortic conus, and a typical juxtaaortic VSD, the posterosuperior margin of the VSD is formed by the left aortic cusp or base of the anterior mitral leaflet, depending on degree of overriding. The ventriculoinfundibular fold and rightward posterior division of the TSM may form the posterior margin of the VSD. Alternatively, the VSD may reach the tricuspid anulus (opposite the anteroseptal leaflet commissure), resulting in mitral-tricuspid continuity, and the VSD is perimembranousH4,W2 (see "Perimembranous Ventricular Septal Defect" under Morphology in Section I of Chapter 35). In this event, the rightward posterior division of the trabecula septomarginalis is deficient, and the bundle of His lies along the posteroinferior border of the VSD and is at risk during surgical repairA4,A5 (Fig. 53-3). Occasionally

VSD lies between the two limbs of the trabecula septomarginalis (TSM) and reaches the tricuspid anulus inferiorly (probe through VSD passes out the aorta). The infundibular septum inserts behind left anterior division of TSM, and its leftward end contributes to the interventricular septum in front of the VSD. **C,** Close-up view of right ventricular outflow to both great arteries. Posterior and leftward insertions of infundibular (conal) septum are clearly seen. Dashed line shows position of suture line for patch used in an intraventricular tunnel repair.

the VSD may extend farther inferiorly beneath the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve.S13 Inferiorly, the VSD is bordered by the trabecula septomarginalis and anteriorly by the infundibular septum.

Chordal attachments of anterior and septal tricuspid leaflets are variable; they may be anomalously attached around the edge of the VSD and seriously interfere with placing of the tunnel patchB2,S5 (Fig. 53-4).

When DORV is associated with L-malposition of the aorta, the VSD is usually juxtaaortic and thus also subaortic. VSD and TSM, within whose limbs the VSD is cradled, lie more anteriorly and superiorly than when the aorta is to the right.V3 The TSM and its limbs form inferior and posterior margins of the defect, as does the aortic valve superiorly. The VSD occasionally extends to the tricuspid anulus and is perimembranous.

## *Subpulmonary Ventricular Septal Defect*

Taussig-Bing heart is the typical example of DORV and subpulmonary VSD.H3,L5,S12,T1,V1 It may be considered a form of DORV in which the VSD is subpulmonary and associated with malalignment of the infundibular septum.

The VSD and TSM lie more superiorly and anteriorly in the ventricular septum, directly beneath the pulmonary conus or valve, than they do in subaortic VSD with rightsided aorta, but in a position similar to that of subaortic VSD with aortic L-malposition. If there is a subpulmonary conus, infundibular (conal) muscle forms the superior margin of the defect. If there is no subpulmonary conus, there is pulmonarymitral and occasionally pulmonary-tricuspid continuity, and the VSD is juxtapulmonary with the pulmonary valve overriding it (Fig. 53-5). The posterosuperior margin of the VSD is formed by the zone of fibrous continuity or by the pulmonary cusps, depending on degree of pulmonary valve overriding, or by the subpulmonary conus if present. As with subaortic VSD, the defect may extend to the tricuspid anulus posteroinferiorly and be perimembranous (see Fig. 53-5), but often it does not. The infundibular septum is usually sagittally oriented and is then not a part of the interventricular septum.H2,Y1

## *Doubly Committed Ventricular Septal Defect*

In doubly committed VSD, an uncommon variant, the VSD and TSM lie more superiorly in the septum than subaortic or

In some respects, this VSD is intermediate between a subaortic and a subpulmonary defect and illustrates the difficulties of accurate and precise categorization. (From Barratt-Boyes and Calder.B2)

subpulmonary VSDs. This, plus absence (or severe hypoplasia) of the infundibular septum and consequent confluence of the aortic and pulmonary valves, place the defect in a juxtaarterial position.A4,B2 The semilunar valves are related to posterior and superior boundaries of the defect. Anterior and inferior boundaries are formed by the TSM and its left anterior division; posteroinferior boundaries are formed by the posterior division. This muscle band usually separates the VSD from the tricuspid valve anulus. There is usually no conus, but if present it is very narrow, and there may be aortic-tricuspid and pulmonary-mitral continuity (Fig. 53-6).

The VSD and its relationships resemble those of isolated juxtaarterial VSD (see Chapter 35), tetralogy of Fallot with juxtaarterial VSD (see Chapter 38), and some types of double outlet left ventricle (see Chapter 54). Both semilunar valves usually lie over the RV, but it can be difficult to decide whether this is the case or whether they lie mostly over the LV. At times, they may arise equally over both ventricles, a condition that can be called *double outlet both ventricles.*B11

*Noncommitted or Remote Ventricular Septal Defect* Trabecular VSDs are not related to the TSM and its divisions, as are VSDs of most hearts with DORV, and they are clearly away from the semilunar valves.L4 However, an inlet septal VSD (see Morphology in Section I of Chapter 35) may be sufficiently remote from the great arteries as to be considered noncommittedL11 (Fig. 53-7).

## Infundibulum

In general, hearts with DORV may have bilateral conuses, one beneath the aortic valve and one beneath the pulmonary valve, or a single conus beneath either semilunar valve, or no conus. About three fourths of hearts with subaortic VSD have bilateral conuses, and about one fourth have only a subpulmonary conus (Table 53-1). An operative experience, however, may reflect a nonrepresentative prevalence of morphologic features. For example, in 350 patients operated on at Madras Medical Mission, the distribution of conal morphology was weighted far more toward absent conus (86%); prevalence of subaortic VSD was 57% (KM Cherian; personal communication, 2000) (Table 53-2). Hearts with subpulmonary VSD (Taussig-Bing hearts) have either bilateral conus or a single conus beneath the aortic valve, in about equal proportions. Hearts with doubly committed VSDs may have a single common conus beneath the two semilunar valves ("doubly committed"), or there may be fibrous continuity between one of the semilunar valves and one of the AV valves, associated with absence of a conus.

There is a pattern of relations between conus and position of the great arteriesV2 (Table 53-3). As a general rule, presence of conus beneath a semilunar valve tends to result in an anterior position of the valve and great artery. Absence of conus links semilunar valve and artery to the mitral valve with fibrous continuity, resulting in a posterior position of valve and artery. As a result, degree of conal development beneath the aortic and pulmonary valves fairly well predicts position and relationship of the great arteries. This can be inferred from the Madras experience (see Table 53-2), in which there is a high prevalence of normally related great arteries and subaortic or absent conus. Anterior position (D-malposition) of the aorta is uncommon (26%) when there are bilateral conuses, but common (67%) when there is only a subaortic conus. An anterior position has not been observed to occur with only subpulmonary conus or with no conus. An aorta side by side with or posterior to the pulmonary trunk occurs in all conal patterns.

## Great Arteries

Both great arteries may lie over the RV in their entirety in the rare instances of DORV with intact ventricular septum and noncommitted VSD. This is often the situation as well when the VSD is subaortic. When the VSD is doubly

The subaortic conus separates aortic from tricuspid valve *(TV)*. Rightward aspect of infundibular (conal) septum is visible. **B,** Infundibular septum and adjacent portion of free wall are displaced toward aorta to reveal opened RV outflow tract, pulmonary valve *(PV)*, and pulmonary trunk *(PT)*. Infundibular septum lies in a sagittal plane and has no attachment to the ventricular septum; moreover, it separates VSD from aortic valve. VSD lies directly above trabecula septomarginalis (TSM), but because the rightward posterior division of the TSM is deficient, it reaches the tricuspid anulus and is perimembranous. PV overrides VSD onto left ventricle *(LV)*. There is no subpulmonary conus. Aorta is to the right and slightly anterior to pulmonary trunk. **C,** View from opened LV. Overriding PV is in direct fibrous continuity with anterior leaflet of mitral valve (MV). (From Barratt-Boyes and Calder.B2)

Both great arteries override ventricular septum. Aortic *(AoV)* and pulmonary valves *(PV)* are in fibrous continuity because there is no infundibular (conal) septum. Aortic valve lies rightward and posterior to pulmonary valve, making a tunnel repair possible. VSD lies between the two divisions of the trabecula septomarginalis *(TSM)*. Persistence of the right posterior division of the septal band prevents aortic–tricuspid valve *(TV)* continuity. **B,** View from opened left ventricle *(LV)*.

committed or subpulmonary, there is usually a variable degree of overriding of one or both great arteries over the VSD.

Positional interrelationships of the great arteries are variable in hearts with DORV. Interrelationships are normal or near-normal in most patients with DORV, with the aorta located rightward and posterior relative to the pulmonary trunkA4,H4,P6 (Table 53-4). Less often, the great arteries are side by side, with the aorta to the right. D-malposition may be present in hearts with DORV, with the aorta anterior and to the right of the pulmonary trunk or at times directly anterior. Rarely, it is anterior and to the left. Occasionally there is L-malposition, with aorta to the left but side by side with the pulmonary trunk.

Although in 77% of hearts with subaortic VSD the aorta is to the right and either side by side or posterior to the pulmonary trunk (more or less normally related), it is anterior (D-malposition) in 23% of cases (see Table 53-4). Furthermore, more or less normally related great arteries are not unique to hearts with subaortic VSD; those with subpulmonary VSD have normally related great arteries in similar frequency (*P* for difference = .8).

Only in hearts with noncommitted VSD is the frequency of more or less normally related great arteries less (33%) (*P* for difference = .06; see Table 53-4). Although *Dmalposition of the aorta* may be considered characteristic of ordinary transposition (see "Great Arteries" under Morphology in Chapter 52) and by implication Taussig-Bing heart, hearts with DORV and subpulmonary VSD are associated with typical D-malposition in a minority of cases (see Table 53-4).

**Table 53-4** Relationship of Ventricular Septal Defect and Position of Great Arteries in Double Outlet Right Ventricle*<sup>a</sup>*

Hearts with doubly committed VSD tend to have more or less normally related great arteries. Observing great artery position at cineangiography or operation does not permit a reasonably accurate inference as to the position and category of the VSD (see Table 53-4). There is no greater certainty that the VSD is subaortic when the great arteries are more or less normally interrelated than when in D-malposition (*P* = .2). When the aorta is in D-malposition, there is no greater certainty that the VSD will be subpulmonary than subaortic (*P* = .8).

## Pulmonary Stenosis

Pulmonary stenosis is common in hearts with a subaortic VSD. It is most often infundibular (Fig. 53-8), but it may be valvar, with or without a small pulmonary valve ring. Thus, all types of pulmonary stenosis observed in hearts with tetralogy of Fallot may be seen in DORV. Rarely, infundibular stenosis may be of the isolated low-lying variety, producing a two-chambered RV.J2,M4

Pulmonary stenosis is also common in hearts with doubly committed VSD (five of five in the GLH experience). It is uncommon in association with Taussig-Bing heart and in hearts with a noncommitted VSD.L4,L9

#### Conduction System

The AV node is in its normal position in the AV septum, and the bundle of His penetrates the right fibrous trigone in the usual way. Thus, the course of the bundle of His relative to the VSD is the same as in primary VSD and in tetralogy of Fallot (see Chapters 35 and 38). The bundle is at risk of damage during repair when the defect reaches the tricuspid anulus (and becomes perimembranous). This is true whether the defect is subaortic or subpulmonary and whether the ascending aorta is right or left sided.A5,B8,L8 However, as in other conditions with clockwise rotation and dextroposition of the aorta, the bundle is more on the LV side of the septum than usual.B8 Furthermore, the trigone is often attenuated in DORV when there is a subaortic conus, which removes the aortic anulus from the central fibrous skeleton of the heart.

When a complete AV septal defect coexists, the node and bundle course are altered accordingly (see "Conduction System" under Morphology in Chapter 34).

#### Coronary Arteries

Coronary artery pattern depends on position of the great arteries. In most varieties of DORV, it is similar to normal except that the aortic sinuses are rotated in a clockwise direction (viewed from below), such that the right coronary arises anteriorly and the left coronary posteriorly.E3 When the aorta is anterior and rightward, the pattern is usually similar to that in transposition of the great arteries (see "Coronary Arteries" under Morphology in Chapter 52), with the right coronary artery arising from sinus 2 (right posterior facing sinus).L3,U2 In 15% of cases, a single coronary ostium may arise either anteriorly or posteriorly that supplies left and right sides of the heart.G2,W2 The branching pattern is also usually normal, except for occasional origin of the left anterior descending from the right coronary artery, with this vessel crossing the RV outflow from right to left as in tetralogy of Fallot (see Chapter 38). This anomaly was found in 25% of the DORV hearts reported in the early Mayo Clinic series, but it was not encountered in 42 GLH autopsy cases.G2

When the aorta is to the left in L-malposition, the right coronary artery passes to the right from the anterior sinus of the leftward anterior aorta to reach the AV groove in front of the pulmonary trunk. Its position prohibits extensive anterior patching across the pulmonary "anulus."

## Associated Anomalies

Major associated cardiac anomalies, in addition to pulmonary stenosis of the tetralogy of Fallot type, may coexist. Coarctation of the aorta may be present, particularly in Taussig-Bing

variant, and may require repair in the neonatal period; rarely, discrete subvalvar aortic stenosis may coexist.G1,S9 Various other cardiac anomalies coexist in about 30% of patients coming to intracardiac repair of DORV with a subaortic or doubly committed VSDP6 (Tables 53-5 and 53-6).

## Morphologic Syndromes of Double Outlet Right Ventricle

## *Simple Double Outlet Right Ventricle*

The phrase *simple DORV* connotes the commonly occurring and easily repaired type of DORV in which the VSD is subaortic and the aorta is to the right, usually by the side of the pulmonary trunk or slightly posterior to it, or which in about 20% of cases is somewhat anterior to the pulmonary trunk (see Table 53-4). The aorta may spiral around the pulmonary trunk as it leaves the heart, or the great arteries may course parallel to each other.A4 Usually there is a conus (infundibulum) beneath both the aorta and pulmonary valve, but in some cases there may be no subaortic conus (see Table 53-1). Coronary arterial anatomy is normal.

In borderline cases, this type of DORV merges with the type in which a perimembranous VSD demonstrates inlet extension and appears to be noncommitted and, on the other hand, the type in which the VSD demonstrates outlet extension and appears to be doubly committed.

## *Taussig-Bing Heart*

In the most representative cases, the Taussig-Bing heart is similar from heart to heart. The VSD is anterior and superior and subpulmonary. The left main coronary artery is anterior to the pulmonary trunk. The pulmonary trunk arises biventricularly over the VSD, and the aorta is to the right and slightly anterior to or alongside it (see Table 53-4). The first portions of aorta and pulmonary trunk are parallel rather than tending to spiral as do normally positioned great arteries.A4,A7,D4 The infundibular septum is in the sagittal plane and is not part of the interventricular septum. Lev and colleagues were able to use specific morphologic features within the RV as the hallmark of Taussig-Bing heart, but this is rarely possible clinically or surgically.L5

Subaortic stenosis, from narrowing of the subaortic infundibulum, may develop in Taussig-Bing heart.Y1 Pulmonary stenosis is uncommon.L9 The mitral valve may straddle across the subpulmonary VSD, and in such cases the LV may be hypoplastic.K9,M10 Associated coarctation of the aorta is

common (about 50% of cases).N2,P2,S9,Y1 This contrasts with the 6% prevalence in transposition with VSD.P2

In borderline cases, this type of DORV merges with transposition of the great arteries and large VSD and, on the other hand, may merge with DORV and noncommitted VSD of the trabecular type.

## *Double Outlet Right Ventricle with Doubly Committed Ventricular Septal Defect*

In DORV with doubly committed VSD, an uncommon syndrome, the VSD is immediately beneath both aorta and pulmonary trunk and is juxta-arterial.

## *Double Outlet Right Ventricle with Noncommitted Ventricular Septal Defect*

When the VSD is in the trabecular septum and clearly far removed from the great arteries, the anomaly is easily categorized into this subset. When the VSD is in the inlet septum and up against the tricuspid valve, categorization as DORV with noncommitted VSD can be questioned, but at least the defect is further removed from the aorta than in most hearts with DORV and subaortic VSD.

## *Double Outlet Right Ventricle with L-Malposition*

DORV with L-malposition usually has a subaortic VSD (rarely extending back to the tricuspid anulus) and pulmonary stenosis and presents a rare but distinctive clinical and surgical syndrome.D2,L7,L8,P4,V3 Rarely the VSD may be perimembranous and extend up toward the pulmonary valve, or it may be truly subpulmonary.S6,W1,Y2 The VSD may, contrariwise, extend into the inlet septum and be noncommitted.A6 Mehrizi has reported DORV with L-malposition and doubly committed VSD.M8

## *Double Outlet Right Ventricle with Complete Atrioventricular Septal Defect*

In cases of DORV with complete AV septal defect, the interventricular communication is large and usually extends deeply beneath a bridging left superior leaflet (see "Atrioventricular Valves" under Morphology in Chapter 34) to be subaortic in position.S10 Occasionally, however, the interventricular communication does not extend in this manner and is noncommitted.B7

## *Double Outlet Right Ventricle with Superior-Inferior Ventricles*

In most hearts with this ventricular position, there is a ventricular L-loop, atrial situs solitus, and AV discordant connection (see Chapter 55). Uncommonly, in DORV with atrial situs solitus, AV concordant connection, and D-ventricular loop, there is a positional anomaly termed *superior-inferior ventricles (over-and-under ventricles*, *upstairs-downstairs ventricles)* (see "Cardiac and Arterial Positions" under Terminology and Classification of Heart Disease in Chapter 1). The RV is superior (and sometimes a little posterior) and the LV inferior. There may be D- or L-malposition of the aorta. The VSD is usually perimembranous and in the inlet portion of the septum. The right AV valve is usually more superiorly placed than usual relative to the left AV valve, and either AV valve may straddle the VSD (see "Ventricular Septal Defect with Straddling or Overriding Tricuspid Valve" under Morphology in Chapter 35). Severe LV hypoplasia may be present, and pulmonary stenosis is common.

# CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

## Pathophysiology

Clinical features of patients with this morphologically highly variable anomaly are necessarily also highly variable. In general, patients with a large VSD and no pulmonary stenosis or severe pulmonary vascular disease are not clinically cyanotic. This is because pulmonary blood flow (Qp ) is high and the resultant mixture of blood in the RV has a high enough oxygen saturation to prevent clinically evident cyanosis; however, there is some arterial desaturation.

#### *Streaming of Blood Flow*

SaO2 is also affected by streaming of blood within the RV, which is determined by the relationship of the semilunar valves to the VSD and the position and presence of the infundibular septum.N2,S11 Thus, in simple DORV, flow of highly oxygen-saturated LV blood through the VSD is directed preferentially beneath the infundibular septum into the adjacent aorta (particularly when the subaortic conus is short or absent), whereas systemic venous blood passes largely out of the pulmonary trunk. As a result, patients with this arrangement present in infancy with high Qp in heart failure without cyanosis and cannot be clinically distinguished from infants with a large VSD (see Clinical Features and Diagnostic Criteria in Section I of Chapter 35).

When the VSD is subpulmonary, as in Taussig-Bing heart, flow through it of highly saturated LV blood is directed into the adjacent pulmonary trunk by the vertically positioned infundibular septum. SpaO2 is then higher than SaO2, with systemic venous blood from the RV tending to flow more into the aorta.W1 This situation is aggravated when there is overriding of the pulmonary trunk onto the LV. Thus, these infants present in a fashion similar to patients with transposition of the great arteries with large VSD in heart failure with mild cyanosis (see "Large Ventricular Septal Defect, Large Patent Ductus Arteriosus, or Both [Good Mixing]" under Morphology in Chapter 52).

## *Pulmonary Vascular Disease*

Pulmonary vascular disease may be more rapid in onset in patients with DORV without pulmonary stenosis than in patients with simple large VSD, particularly in Taussig-Bing heart (see "Pulmonary Vascular Disease" under Natural History in Section I of Chapter 35).S13 The resultant reduction in Qp has a more marked influence on SaO2 than in simple VSD, because it reduces the amount of highly saturated blood in a common mixing chamber.

## *Pulmonary Stenosis*

When important pulmonary stenosis is present, cyanosis becomes severe, and the clinical features and presentation are similar to those of patients with tetralogy of Fallot (see Chapter 38).

## Examination

On physical examination, no clinical signs distinguish patients with DORV with and without pulmonary stenosis from the conditions that they mimic. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is not diagnostic, nor is the chest radiograph. However, in those uncommon instances in which there is L-malposition of the aorta, the aorta may be evident on the posteroanterior chest radiograph as it ascends vertically from the cardiac silhouette in the left upper mediastinumL8,V3; this finding is not specific, however (see Clinical Features and Diagnostic Criteria in Chapter 57).

## Echocardiography

Two-dimensional echocardiography provides a considerable amount of information regarding size of the VSD, relationship of the VSD to the semilunar valves, presence of subvalvar conus, and AV valve abnormalities.H1,S2,S11 Position of the great arteries and conus are usually apparentM1 (Fig. 53-9). The coronary arterial anatomy can also generally be defined accurately in neonates and infants by echocardiography alone.

## Cardiac Catheterization and Cineangiography

Because echocardiographic assessment of morphology is reliable, cardiac catheterization before surgical intervention is not routinely required in neonates and young infants. In older infants and children, it may be needed to assess hemodynamics such as pulmonary vascular resistance and ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and to define extracardiac morphology such as the peripheral pulmonary vasculature and presence of aortopulmonary collateral vessels. Cineangiography can be used when necessary to define intracardiac morphology (Fig. 53-10). The whole of the ventricular septum must be profiled so that its upper part can be

projected cranially. In this way, great vessel positions can be assessed relative to the two ventricles, and location of the VSDs determined.B1,B2 VSD size can be judged (Fig. 53-11) and subsets such as Taussig-Bing heart identified (Fig. 53-12). Cineangiography is of particular value in assessing the complex interrelationships present in DORV with superior-inferior ventricles and criss-cross hearts.B12

## NATURAL HISTORY

The natural history of patients with DORV and AV concordant connection is highly variable, but some general trends can be identified.

The natural history of simple DORV is similar to that of simple large VSD (see Natural History in Section I of Chapter 35); this is probably also true for patients with DORV whose VSD is doubly committed or noncommitted. The exception is that spontaneous VSD closure, which is fatal rather than curative, is rare in DORV.M3

When the VSD is subpulmonary, as in Taussig-Bing heart, the natural history is similar to that for transposition and large VSD, but it is even more unfavorable (see "Ventricular Septal Defects" under Natural History in Chapter 52). This is in part because severe pulmonary vascular disease occurs early in life. Poor prognosis for these patients may also be related to frequent occurrence of left-sided cardiac and extracardiac malformations such as coarctation of the aorta and LV and mitral valve hypoplasia (see "Coarctation as Part of Hypoplastic Left Heart Physiology" under Morphology in Section I of Chapter 48).

When pulmonary stenosis or atresia is present in DORV with subaortic VSD, and probably in those with doubly committed or noncommitted VSD as well, the natural history is indistinguishable from that of patients with tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary stenosis or atresia (see Chapter 38).

The natural history in some patients is dominated by an associated cardiac anomaly, such as a complete AV septal defect (see Natural History in Chapter 34).

#### TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

The type of operation selected depends in part on position of the VSD, relationship of the great arteries, size of the patient, and adequacy of the resulting ventricles and their respective outflows after closing or baffling the VSD. In general:

- Subaortic VSD with an adequate tricuspid to pulmonary valve distance is treated by simple intraventricular baffling that directs LV blood through the VSD to the aorta (intraventricular tunnel repair).
- Subpulmonary VSD, as in Taussig-Bing heart, without pulmonary stenosis is treated with an arterial switch procedure with simple VSD closure that directs blood from the LV to the neoaortic valve.

- Blood flow in doubly committed VSDs is usually baffled using a more complex patch from LV to aorta.
- Noncommitted VSD may be treated by baffling of blood through the VSD to the aorta, accompanied by myocardial flap reinsertion of the straddling tricuspid valve or by a Fontan type of procedure.

Various surgical procedures are described, but description does not imply recommendations. Indications are described later in this chapter under Indications for Operation. Only the general methods are described here, and each patient may be sufficiently unique to require an individual approach.

## Intraventricular Tunnel Repair of Simple Double Outlet Right Ventricle

Preparation for operation, draping, arrangement for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), median sternotomy, and placing stay sutures and sutures for cannulation are as usual (see Section III in Chapter 2). The pericardium is cleared in case

it is needed, and a double velour woven polyester tube (see "Decision and Technique for Transanular Patching" under Technique of Operation in Section I of Chapter 38) whose diameter is about 20% larger than that of the aorta is preclotted, or a collagen-impregnated polyester tube is selected (see "Grafts for Use in Aortic Surgery" in Chapter 24). The intrapericardial anatomy is carefully evaluated.

Support technique and myocardial management are chosen from the usually available alternatives (see "Cold Cardioplegia, Controlled Aortic Root Reperfusion, and [When Needed] Warm Cardioplegic Induction" in Chapter 3). If two venous cannulae are used, after placing the aortic clamp, the right atrium is opened through a small incision, and a pump-oxygenator sump sucker is placed across the natural or surgically created foramen ovale. A single venous cannula can be used if the operation is to be performed through the RV. Operation is performed at 25°C with continuous CPB at a flow of 1.6 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , or at 18°C to 20°C with low CPB flow rate and circulatory arrest when needed for improved exposure. If the desire is to perform the operation entirely during hypothermic circulatory arrest, that technique may be chosen (see Section IV of Chapter 2).

A thorough examination of the intraventricular anatomy can usually be made through the tricuspid valve, and based on this examination, the repair is planned. Repair of simple DORV can be accomplished through the right atrium, although the most superior part of the repair must sometimes be made through a radial incision along the base of the tricuspid anterior and septal leafletsC3,G3,I1 (see Fig. 35-26 in Chapter 35). Through the atrial approach, it is more difficult to be certain that the geometry of the intraventricular tunnel is exactly correct; lacking firm evidence for increased safety of the atrial approach to repair of isolated VSD (see Chapter 35) or tetralogy of Fallot (see Chapter 38), the RV approach may be equally satisfactory.

An intraventricular tunnel is created within the RV that conducts LV blood through the VSD to the aorta. For the transatrial approach, the right atrium is opened in a cephaladcaudad direction near the AV groove. Stay sutures are placed as for the approach for closure of an isolated VSD or as for transatrial repair of tetralogy of Fallot (see Technique of Operation in Section I of Chapters 35 and 38). The anterior tricuspid valve leaflet is elevated by fine stay sutures. For the RV approach, a transverse ventriculotomy is made low in the RV outflow tract, unless the distance between the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) on the left and the right coronary artery (RCA) on the right is inadequate, in which case a vertical infundibular incision is used. Special care is required if there is an anomalous origin of the LAD from the RCA. For exposure, stay sutures are placed on the ventriculotomy. The anatomy is carefully assessed, verifying anatomic details of the diagnosis. Location and size of the VSD are noted, and particularly whether it abuts the tricuspid valve or has a rim of muscle along its posterior border (Fig. 53-13). This latter determines the relationship of the bundle of His to the posterior margin of the VSD.

Small size of the VSD does not alone negate the possibility of an adequate intraventricular tunnel between LV and aorta. The possibility of enlarging it and creating a tunnel of adequate size and configuration depends primarily on the distance between the tricuspid and pulmonary valves.S1 Sakata, Lecompte, and colleagues estimate that when this distance is less than the diameter of the aorta, a tunnel placed posterior to the pulmonary trunk will be stenotic; they recommend that in such a case, the tunnel be placed anterior to the orifice of the pulmonary trunk.S1 However, in simple DORV, this distance is usually long (see Figs. 53-2 and 53-4), making this malformation suited for intraventricular tunnel repair, with the tunnel posterior to the orifice of the pulmonary trunk.

As a first step, the VSD is enlarged anteriorly if it is clearly restrictive to flow into a tunnel from the LV. Before this is done, the area of the proposed enlargement is carefully examined to be certain that it is interventricular septum and not hypertrophied and trabeculated anterior ventricular wall. Cutting into the latter imposes the risks of damaging the LAD and developing an LV false aneurysm.E2 Generally, a simple incision into the interventricular septum from the VSD gapes open widely and suffices, but occasionally some muscle must be excised. In doing this, the mitral valve must be kept out of harm's way.

The VSD patch is then cut from a polyester tube (see Fig. 53-13). Geometry of the patch is crucial in preventing subaortic stenosis after the repair. The patch will form the anterior half of the tunnel connecting the VSD to the aortic orifice; the posterior half of the tunnel will be heart tissue, and experience indicates that this provides adequately for growth of the tunnel. Thus, initial trimming is made to retain about half to two thirds of the circumference of the tube graft that was selected, so as to have a diameter about 20% greater than that of the ascending aorta. The patch is then trimmed so that its *length* is the distance from the anterior angle of the VSD to the anterior edge of the subaortic conus or, if this is hypoplastic, LV-aortic junction (aortic valve "anulus").

The technique for inserting the patch is analogous to that for inserting the patch in isolated VSD (see Fig. 35-24 in Chapter 35) or tetralogy of Fallot (see Chapter 38). Because correct orientation of the patch is essential to creating a geometrically correct tunnel, a marking stitch is placed at the most anterior part of the repair, and another is placed through the patch at a corresponding point. A similar marking stitch is placed over the midportion of the aorta anteriorly and in the patch. The first pledgeted mattress stitch is passed from the atrial to ventricular side through the base of the tricuspid commissural tissue between the anterior and septal leaflets (see Fig. 53-13). If the approach is through the right atrium and tricuspid valve, the suture is usually begun anteriorly at the most caudal aspect of the VSD. (If a bar of muscle separates the VSD from the tricuspid anulus, the sutures may be placed just on the right side of the edge of this muscle, as in a similar anatomic situation in tetralogy of Fallot; see Chapter 38.) Suturing is carried leftward for a short distance between the patch and tricuspid leaflet tissue and after a few stitches between the patch and ventriculoinfundibular fold and up along the right side of subaortic infundibulum. When the marking stitch is reached, the suture is held. With the other arm of the suture, the patch is sewn to the RV side of the septum, 5 to 7 mm back from the edge of the VSD, proceeding rightward, anteriorly, and then superiorly (see Fig. 53-13). When the repair is completed, the contoured polyester patch forms the anterior portion of an unobstructed intraventricular tunnel between the VSD and aorta.

Rewarming the patient by the perfusate is commenced, and the interatrial communication is closed with a few sutures, but not tied until there is effective ventricular contraction (to

The perimembranous VSD has been exposed through a right ventriculotomy. There is moderate hypertrophy of the parietal band, which is mobilized and partially resected. **B,** A polyester tube of diameter about 20% larger than that of the aortic root has been cut to a length that is the same as the distance from the anterior border of the VSD to the aortic valve.

avoid LV distension). The left atrium is filled with saline via a blunt needle and the aortic clamp removed with strong suction on the aortic needle vent.

If an RV approach is used, it is closed either primarily or with a small patch; a patch is used when there is infundibular pulmonic stenosis (as for tetralogy of Fallot) or if the intraventricular tunnel bulges anteriorly, potentially obstructing RV outflow. The remainder of the operation is carried out as usual (see Section III in Chapter 2). The repair is evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography just before and after discontinuing CPB. In addition to the usual measurements, LV and aortic pressures are measured to exclude any gradient across the baffle; when the repair is done as described, no gradient is present.

#### Repair of Double Outlet Right Ventricle with Subaortic Ventricular Septal Defect and Pulmonary Stenosis

Repair is essentially that for tetralogy of Fallot, as described in "Technique of Operation" in Section I of Chapter 38. The only difference is the intraventricular tunnel repair, as just described, rather than simple VSD closure.

## Repair of Taussig-Bing Heart by Arterial Switch Repair

The usual Taussig-Bing type of DORV with subpulmonary VSD is best treated by closure of the VSD in such a manner that the LV ejects into the neoaorta, and by an arterial switch (see "Arterial Switch Operation" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 52).

Approach to repair of the VSD is varied, and the decision is best made before operation, based on the following considerations (Quaegebeur JM; personal communication, 1991):

- When the VSD is perimembranous or juxta-tricuspid, and particularly when it extends toward the inlet septum, repair is probably most effectively accomplished from the right atrium.
- When the VSD extends toward the RV outlet and the pulmonary trunk does not override the VSD, repair is most easily accomplished through the proximal aortic (neopulmonary) segment after removing the aortic buttons containing coronary ostia. The landmarks and techniques are identical to those used when a VSD is repaired through a right ventriculotomy.
- When the pulmonary trunk is large and overrides the VSD, as is usually the case, an approach to the VSD through the proximal pulmonary (neoaortic) segment is convenient.O1 However, the posteroinferior portion of the insertion of the patch to close the VSD (performed so that the LV ejects into the pulmonary trunk [neoaorta]) is approached from the RV aspect as a protection against damaging the conducting tissue.

The arterial switch is then performed (see "Arterial Switch Operation" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 52). Because the great arteries are often side by side, suitable adjustments are made in the operation (see Chapter 52, Fig. 52-28). If arch hypoplasia is present, it is addressed surgically with one of several possible approaches. Either a standard interrupted arch repair technique is used (see Technique of Operation in Section II of Chapter 48) or the relatively hypoplastic ascending aorta can be reoriented from its vertical position to a horizontal position and anastomosed end to end to the descending aorta, followed by anastomosis of the proximal pulmonary trunk (neoaorta) to the transversely positioned ascending aorta.L6 When arch hypoplasia is present, there is a high likelihood of hypoplasia of the RV outflow tract, and clinically important postoperative infundibular obstruction is common. Therefore, the RV outflow tract should be addressed surgically when arch obstruction is present. In this setting, the VSD is best repaired through a vertical infundibular incision, with infundibular resection and patching.

## Intraventricular Tunnel Repair of Taussig-Bing Heart

Although the place of the intraventricular tunnel repair of Taussig-Bing heart is not securely established, small series of successful operations have been reported.A1,K3,M6,P1,P3,S14,Y1

Initial stages of operation are the same as in other operations for Taussig-Bing heart. After CPB and cold cardioplegia have been established and the right atrium opened, morphology within the RV is studied through the tricuspid valve. Distance from tricuspid to pulmonary valves is estimated; if this distance is too short, the LV-to–pulmonary trunk tunnel will probably need to pass anterior to the pulmonary valve (see "Intraventricular Tunnel Repair of Simple Double Outlet Right Ventricle" earlier in this chapter); alternatively, an arterial switch operation is used.L2,R3 Any attachment of tricuspid chordae to septal edges of the malaligned infundibular septum is noted because special measures are needed for these. Straddling or overriding of the mitral valve is of considerable importance because this may make the planned operation impossible. Usually, after completing the examination from the right atrium, a transverse right ventriculotomy is made for the repair, although sometimes repair may be accomplished from the right atrial approach.

Ideally, the surgically created intraventricular tunnel is fashioned to lie posterior to the pulmonary trunk (Kawashima method), but this depends on availability of space between the tricuspid and pulmonary valves, as noted earlierK3 (Fig. 53-14). Adequate space is more likely to be available when the great arteries are side by side rather than in an anteroposterior position. Generally the VSD is enlarged anteriorly, and at least a portion of infundibular septum is excised. It may be helpful to open the pulmonary trunk and pass a Hegar dilator through the pulmonary valve to expose the infundibular septum and protect the mitral apparatus (see "Lecompte Intraventricular Repair" in text that follows). As this is being done, care is taken to avoid damaging the aortic valve cusps and chordae from the tricuspid valve. If these chordae attach alongside an area that requires enlargement, that portion is not excised but instead is turned up as a flap. After creation of the intraventricular tunnel, the flap of infundibular septum is sutured in place over the tunnel.B9 The polyester patch is trimmed to an appropriate size and configuration (see Fig. 53-13) and sewn into place with the usual care to avoid damaging the conduction system (see Fig. 53-14).

When the aorta is directly anterior, there is usually insufficient space between the tricuspid and pulmonary valves for a posterior position of the intraventricular tunnel. If an intraventricular tunnel repair is performed, the VSD is enlarged appropriately and the tunnel created *anterior* to the

In the illustration, great arteries are side by side, with aorta to the right of the pulmonary trunk and with an adequate distance between tricuspid and pulmonary valves. **A,** Right ventricle is opened through a vertical or transverse incision. The tricuspid valve apparatus is away from the infundibular septum and ventricular septal defect *(VSD),* which facilitates intraventricular repair. **B,** VSD is enlarged by excising ventricular septum anteriorly, and the infundibular septum is partially cut away to provide better access of intraventricular tunnel to aortic orifice *(dashed lines).* Often, only an incision is required. **C,** The intraventricular tunnel repair is performed using an appropriately sized and shaped patch made from a polyester tube (see Fig. 53-12) and placed with continuous suture, sometimes supplemented with interrupted stitches.

pulmonary orifice (Patrick-McGoon method)M9,P1,P3 (Fig. 53-15). In some cases, if this technique is used, a prosthetic tube (rather than a patch) is needed for part of the pathway, and part of the tube is incorporated into the closure of the right ventriculotomy.D7

## Lecompte Intraventricular Repair

Although the role of this operation, which Lecompte calls *REV* (réparation à l'étage ventriculaire), is not yet certain, its concepts and results mandate consideration. In this operation, the LV is connected to the aorta and the RV to the pulmonary trunk by a technique that does not require an extracardiac conduit.B9,L2,R3,S1,V4 It is designed for patients in whom a simple intraventricular tunnel repair is not possible, nor is an arterial switch operation combined with repair of the VSD in such a manner that the LV is connected to the proximal pulmonary trunk (neoaortic) segment. The reason for the latter is usually coexisting important pulmonary (LV outflow) stenosis. The diagnosis may be some form of DORV or transposition with VSD and LV outflow obstruction. The Lecompte operation has also been demonstrated to be applicable to double outlet LV in infancy, thus avoiding need for a valved extracardiac conduit (Bailey LL; personal communication, 1991).

Initial stages of operation are the same as for intraventricular repair. After CPB and cold cardioplegia have been established, and after the preliminary examination from the right atrium is accomplished, a vertical right ventriculotomy is made and extended as far cephalad as possible. After thorough assessment of intraventricular anatomy and great arteries, the aorta and pulmonary trunk are transected (Fig. 53-16, *A*). All interventricular and infundibular septal tissue between the VSD and great arteries is resected. A Hegar dilator introduced through the pulmonary trunk helps with exposure during resection (Fig. 53-16, *B*). Cusps of the aortic valve

**Figure 53-15** Repair of double outlet right ventricle with subpulmonary ventricular septal defect *(VSD)* (Taussig-Bing heart) when there is only a short distance between tricuspid and pulmonary valves (Patrick-McGoon methodM9,P1,P3). Aorta is usually anterior to pulmonary trunk. **A,** Through a transverse right ventriculotomy, the VSD is enlarged and much of the inlet septum excised *(dashed line).* **B,** A contoured polyester (or polytetrafluoroethylene) patch is cut from a tube graft whose diameter is about 20% larger than that of the aorta. Initial suturing is performed in the usual manner, preventing damage to the bundle of His. A continuous suture is used, often supplemented by interrupted stitches. **C,** With the leftward arm of the continuous suture, suture line is continued leftward along the posterior and then leftward margin of the ventriculopulmonary trunk junction, and finally along the anterior margin of this junction *(dashed line).* With the other arm of the suture, the patch is sutured inferior to the VSD, to the right side of the septum, and then anterior to the defect. **D,** Insertion of spiraled patch has been completed. Left ventricular blood now passes beneath the patch to the aorta, while right ventricular blood passes to the pulmonary trunk behind the tunnel.

must be visualized to protect them from damage in the course of resection. The excision is kept away from regions occupied by the bundle of His and its primary branches. When tricuspid chordae are attached to a portion of the infundibular or ventricular septum, this portion is raised as a flap with chordae attached.B9 After completing the intraventricular repair, the flap is sutured to the roof of the tunnel, more or less in its original position.

The intraventricular tunnel repair is performed by suturing a polyester or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) patch into place to form the roof of the LV-aortic pathway (Fig. 53-16, *C*).

The proximal segment of the pulmonary trunk is closed (for details, see "Bidirectional Superior Cavopulmonary Shunt" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 41). Because this repair is generally performed in patients in whom the aorta is anterior to the pulmonary trunk, the pulmonary trunk and its bifurcation are usually translocated anterior to the aorta. For this, the aortic clamp is repositioned, and the distal aortic segment is brought behind the bifurcation of the

Pulmonary trunk has been enlarged by an incision anteriorly and its posterior wall anastomosed to the right ventriculotomy. **E,** Repair is completed with a polyester (or polytetrafluoroethylene or pericardial) patch placed as a roof over the right ventriculopulmonary trunk pathway, using the same principles as in placing a transanular patch in repair of tetralogy of Fallot (see Fig. 38-29 in Chapter 38).

pulmonary trunk (Fig. 53-16, *D*), as in the Lecompte maneuver for the arterial switch operation (see "Arterial Switch Operation" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 52). The aorta is reconstructed behind and to the right of the distal pulmonary trunk segment.

The posterior lip of the distal segment of the pulmonary trunk is anastomosed to the cephalad margin of the right ventriculotomy. The right ventricular–pulmonary trunk pathway is completed by suturing a roof of pericardium, polyester, or PTFE into place (Fig. 53-16, *E*). Lecompte incorporates a monocusp valve beneath the patch.

Nikaidoh Aortic Translocation and Right Ventricular Outflow Reconstruction

The first step in this procedure is to core out the intact aortic root from the RV, including aortic valve and coronary arteries, as described earlier by Bex and colleaguesB6,N3 (Fig. 53-17). The pulmonary trunk is transected, and an incision in the interventricular septum between the VSD and lumen of the proximal stump of the pulmonary trunk opens this area widely. This allows the VSD (and through it the LV) to be joined to the aorta by a roofing patch, which is similar to that

placed in the other intraventricular tunnel repairs. The pulmonary trunk is then joined to the RV outflow tract as described for the Lecompte intraventricular repair.

## Repair of Taussig-Bing Heart by Atrial Switch Procedure

Operation is begun through the atrial incision mandated by the venous switch procedure to be used (see "Atrial Switch Operation" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 52). Working through the tricuspid valve, the VSD is repaired so that the LV ejects into the pulmonary trunk.H2 An atrial switch procedure is done. When important LV outflow obstruction is present, an allograft valved extracardiac conduit is also placed between the LV and pulmonary trunk.

## Intraventricular Tunnel Repair of Double Outlet Right Ventricle with Doubly Committed Ventricular Septal Defect

After CPB and cold cardioplegia are established, a transverse right ventriculotomy is made. A slightly modified tunnel repair is done, very much as described under "Intraventricular Tunnel Repair of Simple Double Outlet Right Ventricle" earlier in this chapter. However, when the two semilunar valves lie side by side and the pulmonary "anulus" is the larger, contouring the patch to achieve this may be difficult without obstructing flow into the pulmonary trunk. This problem can be minimized by enlarging the VSD anteriorly as much as possible before placing the patch.

## Intraventricular Tunnel Repair of Double Outlet Right Ventricle with Noncommitted Ventricular Septal Defect

When the noncommitted VSD is of the inlet septal type (see Morphology in Section I of Chapter 35), it extends beneath the tricuspid septal leaflet rather than anteriorly or superiorly. It may be possible to enlarge this defect anteriorly and superiorly so that a tunnel repair can be performed that connects the LV to the aorta (Fig. 53-18). The precautions used against damaging the conduction system are those used for repair of inlet septal VSD (see Fig. 34-20 in Chapter 34). If the tunnel obstructs access to the pulmonary valve, an allograft (or other biological) valved conduit is placed from the RV to the pulmonary trunk.

## Other Operations for Double Outlet Right Ventricle with Noncommitted Ventricular Septal Defect

In some patients with an inlet septal type of noncommitted VSD, tricuspid valve chordae may overhang the defect; in these cases, its enlargement as described is not possible, and a tunnel repair cannot be carried out. The same situation may exist when there is a large single or multiple muscular VSDs in the trabecular septum.

*When pulmonary stenosis coexists*, a Fontan operation is performed. The technique of total cavopulmonary connection (see discussion under Technique of Operation in Chapter 41) is particularly suited to this situation because nothing has to be done to the AV valves or within the ventricle except to enlarge the VSD if it is restrictive.

When the tunnel repair cannot be made and *pulmonary stenosis is not present*, the situation should be identified very early in life, and a pulmonary trunk band should be placed (see "Pulmonary Trunk Banding" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 35). Subsequently a Fontan operation should be performed.

## Repair of Double Outlet Right Ventricle with Complete Atrioventricular Septal Defect

Technique of repair is similar to that for repair of complete AV septal defect and tetralogy of Fallot as described under Technique of Operation in Chapter 34. However, the situation becomes considerably more complex in the setting of heterotaxy syndromes, in which anomalous pulmonary venous connection is common and the VSD of the AV septal defect may be remote from the aortic valve in the presence of a muscular subaortic infundibulum (conus) (see Chapter 58).

## Repair of Double Outlet Right Ventricle with L-Malposition of the Aorta

In nearly all surgical patients in this subset, the VSD is subaortic and pulmonary stenosis coexists. The heart is opened by a vertical incision in the RV. Usually, the VSD is easily visualized anterosuperiorly in the ventricular septum and well away from the tricuspid anulus. An intraventricular tunnel repair with a contoured patch may not be necessary, and a simple polyester or PTFE patch may be used to close the VSD in such a way that the LV ejects into the aorta. Stitches may be placed along the edge of the VSD posteriorly unless the defect abuts the tricuspid valve. An allograft valved extracardiac conduit is usually placed between the RV and pulmonary trunk, because of associated severe valvar and subvalvar pulmonary stenosis (see Figs. 38-68 and 38-70 in Chapter 38).

## Repair of Double Outlet Right Ventricle with Discordant Atrioventricular Connections

A complete discussion of discordant AV connections is found in Chapter 55. In DORV with discordant AV connections, three major options are available:

- Traditional or physiologic repair in which the morphologic RV is retained as the systemic ventricle
- Anatomically corrective operations that leave the morphologic LV as the systemic ventricle
- Single-ventricle strategies ending in the Fontan operation

*Traditional repairs* that use the RV as the systemic ventricle include VSD closure and the Rastelli procedure, or VSD closure with baffling of LV to pulmonary trunk, with or without relief of LV outflow tract obstruction to the pulmonary trunk. *Anatomic repairs* include the "double switch" procedure (atrial switch procedure and arterial switch combined with VSD closure to direct blood from LV to neoaortic valve) and atrial switch procedure with rerouting of blood from LV through VSD to aortic valve, with or without a Rastelli procedure.

## Palliative Operations

Shunting operations are described in Chapter 38 (see "Technique of Shunting Operations" under Technique of Operation in Section I) and pulmonary trunk banding in Chapter 35 (see "Pulmonary Trunk Banding" under Technique of Operation in Section I).

# SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Care after corrective or palliative operations for DORV is described in Chapter 5.

# RESULTS

#### Survival

# *Early (Hospital) Death*

Even intraventricular tunnel repair of *simple DORV* in heterogeneous patient populations has had a hospital mortality through the years of about 20%.K8 This figure is not relevant, however, to the current era (see "Incremental Risk Factors for Premature Death" later in this chapter), a fact verified by multivariable and univariable analysesK8 in widely separated institutions (Fig. 53-19) and more recent data reported by Kleinert and colleagues,K10 all indicating a current hospital mortality of less than 2%. In 148 patients having biventricular repair, overall mortality was 8.1% (CL 5.8%- 11%). Belli and colleagues reported similar results in 154 patients in the present era (9.8%; CL 7.2%-13%).B4 Brown and colleagues reported results of various repairs for DORV in 124 patients operated on between 1980 and 2000.B14 Depending on complexity of the anatomy and location of the VSD, four types of repair were used: intraventricular baffle (*n* = 53), baffle plus conduit (*n* = 20), arterial switch (*n* = 16), and Fontan procedures (*n* = 33). Hospital mortality was 4.8% (CL 2.9%-7.7%).

Overall hospital mortality following the various types of repair of *Taussig-Bing heart* has been even higher in the past, about 50%.K8 This again is not relevant to the current era, in which the arterial switch procedure is used for most of these patients (see Fig. 52-37 in Chapter 52). For example, employing the arterial switch operation for DORV with subpulmonary VSD, Masuda and colleagues reported one death in 27 patients (3.7%; CL 0.5%-12%) ranging in age from 10 days to 5 years (median 0.4 years).M5

Given the frequency of coexisting coarctation and the possible application of preliminary pulmonary trunk banding for Taussig-Bing hearts, controversy exists regarding the advisability of initial repair of coarctation only vs. one-stage correction using the arterial switch operation. In the current era, low mortality (<5%) has been reported both with initial repair of coarctation through a left thoracotomy followed by subsequent arterial switchG4,R2 and with single-stage repair via sternotomy.A3

Kawashima and colleagues used an interventricular rerouting repair with extensive resection of the infundibular septum in 10 of 41 patients with Taussig-Bing heart (average age 2 years), with no deaths (0%; CL 0%-17%).K4

Estimating overall early mortality after repair of *DORV with doubly committed VSD* is difficult because of the small number of reported cases, but in general it has been about the same as after repair of simple DORV.K8 The same difficulty is true of *DORV with noncommitted VSD*, exacerbated by the variety of operations used and the uncertainty of categorization of many patients in this group. Early mortality has probably been about 50%. The Fontan operation should be expected to yield the same mortality as in patients with univentricular AV connection, which is less than 5% in appropriately selected patients (see Chapter 41).

# *Time-Related Survival*

Long-term survival after repair of simple DORV exceeds 95% at 15 years (see Fig. 53-19).

## Incremental Risk Factors for Premature Death

An analysis based on the UAB experience between 1967 and July 1984 probably still serves reasonably well for simple DORV and DORV with doubly committed VSD, but not for varieties of DORV in which the arterial switch operation is now performed.K8

## *Age at Repair*

Currently, and in contrast to an era before about 1980, *young age* at operation is not a risk factor for death early or late after repair of simple DORV and probably of DORV with doubly committed VSD.L10 In fact, *older age* at operation is now the risk factor, and it is a particularly strong risk factor in the constant hazard phase (see Fig. 53-19). These relationships, and indeed survival in general, are similar to those obtained after repair of primary isolated VSD, and they probably are explained largely by absence or presence and severity of pulmonary vascular disease. Currently, patients undergoing repair of simple DORV during the first 6 months of life have about a 99% chance of 1-month survival and a 95% chance of long-term survival and surgical cure.

Among patients with Taussig-Bing heart, age greater than about 6 months is a risk factor for mortality, likely related to pulmonary vascular disease. However, Feng and colleagues found similar survival among a small group of patients with transposition and VSD and those with Taussig-Bing heart who underwent an arterial switch operation and VSD closure before or after age 6 months.F1

## *Type of Double Outlet Right Ventricle*

*Simple DORV* and *DORV with doubly committed VSD* and no pulmonary stenosis are particularly favorable types of DORV with regard to survival after repair and are not risk factors for death.

In the past, *DORV with subpulmonary VSD* was a strong risk factor for death early or late after repair, largely related to combining repair of the VSD with an atrial switch procedure.K8 Early and long-term survival after repair of the VSD combined with an arterial switch procedure are similar to those after the arterial switch repair of transposition of the great arteries and VSDK1,M5,Q1,Q2 (see Chapter 52, Fig. 52-37).

In the past, survival after repair of *DORV with noncommitted VSD* has been less than that of any other group, but assignment of patients to this group is almost by exclusion. This makes it the least homogeneous group morphologically; also, a number of different kinds of repairs are used. The anatomic subset is sufficiently uncommon, the categorization of patients into it sufficiently arguable, and operations for

In the case illustration, the pulmonary trunk is left on the right ventricular side, but the tunnel partially obstructs approach to it.

Right ventriculopulmonary artery continuity is established with a xenograft **(C)** or allograft valved extracardiac conduit **(D)**.

correcting it sufficiently variable that some time may elapse before early and intermediate-term survival are known with a reasonable degree of certainty. When known, it may indicate more frequent use of the Fontan group of operations in this subset of patients.

# *Major Associated Cardiac Anomalies*

*Pulmonary stenosis* coexists with DORV in many patients, and its presence often requires creating a nonvalved or valved connection to the pulmonary trunk. Related to this, the presence of pulmonary stenosis is probably an incremental risk factor for death, because both procedures increase mortality.S13

*Complete AV septal defects, straddling AV valves, hypoplasia of a ventricular chamber, mitral valve abnormalities*, and other coexisting anomalies increase risk.B4 This has usually been related to persisting in an attempt to perform an optimal operation rather than accepting the need for a more appropriate and often simpler procedure such as the Fontan group of operations.

#### Surgical Era

Earlier date of operation has been clearly identified as a risk factor for death by several studies. This indicates that outcomes after repair of all types of DORV are currently better than at any time in the past, and this difference is quantifiable.

## Type of Operation

Atrial Switch Operation Use of an atrial switch operation in conjunction with an intraventricular tunnel repair has given poor results in general, including hospital mortalities of 30% to 40%. In this setting, the atrial switch repair is at least as strong a risk factor as it is in transposition of the great arteries and VSD (see Chapter 52). For this reason, it is no longer used.

Complex Intraventricular Tunnel Repair A simple intraventricular tunnel repair, such as that performed for DORV with subaortic VSD, has no more demonstrable risk than repair of a large primary isolated VSD with a patch (see Chapter 35). This is the reason for excellent outcome after repair of simple DORV in early life.

A somewhat more complex intraventricular tunnel repair, such as that used to redirect LV outflow in the Rastelli operation (see "Rastelli Operation" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 52) but with minimal excision of septal tissue and

a resultant straight and relatively short pathway leading to the aorta, has little demonstrable incremental risk. This is supported by the current low early mortality after the Rastelli operation and by the low prevalence of complications from the tunnel itself late postoperatively. When used under proper circumstances for Taussig-Bing malformation, early and intermediate-term survival has been good and comparable to that obtained with the arterial switch repair. S3

More complex intraventricular tunnel repairs appear to be incremental risk factors, although this idea has not been properly tested by analysis. Hospital mortality has been 10% to 15% after such procedures but may currently be less than 5%. K4,P1,V4 However, late morality may be affected by baffle obstruction and patch dehiscence with complex tunnels. P1

Transanular Patches and Extracardiac Conduits Use of transanular patches and extracardiac conduits has increased the risk of operations for DORV, but at times their use is inescapable. K8,S13 As in other situations, controversy exists as to whether absence of a valve in the RV–pulmonary trunk connection adds to risk. Whether the risk of these procedures is any different from that imposed by the type of RV–pulmonary artery connection used in the Lecompte operation (REV) remains to be determined.

Operations for Double Outlet Right Ventricle with Atrioventricular Discordant Connections A variety of operations have been successfully applied to this subset of DORV. No single strategy has proved superior in terms of long-term survival and freedom from reoperation. Shin'oka and colleagues found no significant difference in late survival 15 to 20 years after operation according to procedure performed, 57 whether traditional repair, anatomic repair, or Fontan procedure was employed.

## Complications of Intraventricular Tunnel Repair

Need for reoperation for complications of the tunnel repair (leakage or obstruction primarily) is directly related to complexity of the tunnel. Thus, in simple intraventricular tunnel repair for DORV and subaortic VSD, only 1% of patients have had catheterization evidence of tunnel leakage or obstruction, or reoperation for it. K8 By contrast, 18% or more of patients with complex intraventricular tunnel repairs have required reoperation for important obstruction or leakage, or have had evidence of these problems (P = .005). <sup>12,K8</sup> An analysis by Fujii and colleagues indicated that length of the intraventricular tunnel is predictive of mortality. Among patients in whom the length between the top of the interventricular septum and aortic valve was less than 80% of normal LV end-diameter, event-free survival at 7 years was 89%, vs. 26% when it was greater than 80%. F3 Late tunnel obstruction of complex intraventricular tunnel repairs may be more likely to develop when performed in young infants.<sup>P1</sup>

The likelihood of reoperation for LV outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction also relates to presence of potentially obstructing infundibular muscle in the new LVOT under the patch. Dearani and colleagues have emphasized the importance of VSD enlargement and infundibular septal resection when performing the Rastelli operation. Da Similarly, Rubay and colleagues emphasized the importance of conal resection in the REV procedure. Ra,Ya Yeh and colleagues have reported the advantages of the Nikaidoh procedure in preventing late LVOT obstruction. In the setting of Taussig-Bing heart with valvar or subvalvar pulmonary stenosis of sufficient severity to

preclude the arterial switch operation, identification of the optimal procedure to maximize early and late survival and minimize occurrence of LVOT obstruction awaits further long-term studies.

## Complications after Taussig-Bing Repair

Complications of complex intraventricular tunnel repair have been detailed in the preceding discussion. Reoperations following the arterial switch operation have also been common, most notably RV outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction, both supravalvar—likely related to insufficient mobilization of the pulmonary arteries in preparation for the Lecompte maneuver, pericardial patch shrinkage, or inadequate patch size (see Chapter 52)—and subvalvar. Alsoufi and colleagues reported a 10-year freedom from RVOT obstruction of 55%.A3 They indicate that alterations in constructing the patch for pulmonary trunk reconstruction have reduced supravalvar obstruction. More complete resection of the subaortic RV outlet has reduced occurrence of RVOT obstruction requiring reoperation.A3,S8 Further studies are needed to clarify the importance of these problems with current techniques.

## INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Much of the previous information on outcomes after surgical repair of DORV is not applicable to patient care decisions in the current era, except that it permits developing equations that take into account the change in outcomes related to more recent dates of operation. Greater safety of intracardiac operations done early in life and good results of the arterial switch operation are two important factors in the improvement of current results. Improvements in myocardial management, support techniques, and intensive care unit management of neonates and infants undoubtedly play a role as well.

Recommendations for specific operations can only be general, and some cases may require special consideration. Representative strategies based on location of the VSD are presented in Table 53-7.

## Simple Double Outlet Right Ventricle with Subaortic Ventricular Septal Defect

Simple DORV can be diagnosed very early in life, often by echocardiography alone. Repair should be electively planned

by age 3 to 6 months, or sooner if signs of heart failure or failure to thrive persist. The operation should be intraventricular tunnel repair performed via a right atrial or, more frequently, RV approach.

When important pulmonary stenosis coexists, indications for operation and the operation are the same as for tetralogy of Fallot (see Indications for Operation in Section I of Chapter 38). Essentially, repair is advisable whenever important symptoms develop or electively, according to the same principles that apply to tetralogy of Fallot.

## Double Outlet Right Ventricle with Subpulmonary Ventricular Septal Defect (Taussig-Bing Heart)

Taussig-Bing heart should be repaired by closure of the VSD so that the LV ejects into the pulmonary trunk (neoaorta), combined with an arterial switch repair. Operation should be performed during the first month of life or as soon as possible thereafter. Some surgeons continue to prefer the Kawashima procedure when the great arteries are side by side,K2,K4 but many currently apply the arterial switch operation irrespective of great artery position.A3,R2

There is possibly no longer an indication for one of the intraventricular repairs for this anomaly unless there is coexisting subpulmonary obstruction of such a type and severity as to contraindicate arterial switch repair. Under these circumstances, an intraventricular tunnel repair (Kawashima) is indicated, supplemented by RV–pulmonary trunk valved conduit or a reconstruction of the type described under "Lecompte Intraventricular Repair." Nikaidoh aortic translocation and RV outflow reconstruction can also be considered in this setting. The atrial switch type of operation no longer has a place in managing this group of patients.

Operations other than those including the arterial switch repair but including an extracardiac conduit should ideally be deferred until about 3 to 6 years of age. However, if more than a single systemic-pulmonary shunt appears to be necessary in the interim, it is preferable to proceed prematurely with complete repair (see Indications for Operation in Section II of Chapter 38).

## Double Outlet Right Ventricle with Doubly Committed Ventricular Septal Defect

Generally this malformation is uncomplicated by coexisting cardiac anomalies, and the rationale and timing of repair are the same as for simple DORV.

## Double Outlet Right Ventricle with Noncommitted Ventricular Septal Defect

Placing a patient in the subset of DORV with noncommitted VSD is often controversial, complicating the discussion of indications. When the malformation truly seems to be of this type, repair should consist of appropriately enlarging the VSD if possible so that an intraventricular tunnel can be created to direct LV blood to the aorta. When the pulmonary trunk is obstructed by the tunnel, a RV–pulmonary trunk valved extracardiac conduit or the Lecompte procedure is added. Hu and colleagues have reported using the translocation technique for this anomaly, with a double root translocation procedure.H5 When the anatomy dictates that the tunnel be directed to the pulmonary trunk, and if pulmonary stenosis

is not present, the tunnel is made and an arterial switch operation added. Alternatively, pulmonary trunk banding early in life and a subsequent Fontan operation may be considered.

## SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

Single-Ventricle Strategy versus Biventricular Repair for Complex Double Outlet Right Ventricle

There is controversy regarding the optimal treatment strategy for certain forms of complex DORV related to the most reliable approach to achieve long-term survival, maintain good functional outcome, and minimize reoperation. Evidencebased recommendations are confounded by the large variety of anatomic variants within specific morphologic subsets (and potential importance of such variants for the conduct of and outcome after specific operations), the small number of specific operations for these anatomic variants at any given institution, the duration of follow-up needed to fully evaluate newer surgical procedures, and "philosophical" differences among institutions regarding single versus biventricular approaches. The controversial aspects relate primarily to two areas: hypoplasia of mitral valve or LVB10,P7 and nonsubaortic VSDs that are not reparable with the arterial switch operation and simple baffling of the LV to the neoaortic valve. Bradley and colleagues have drawn attention to this controversy with an elegant analysis of nearly 400 patientsB10 in which they conclude that extending biventricular repair in "borderline anatomic candidates" may be of questionable long-term benefit compared with the Fontan pathway. Similar observations have been made by others.D5

In favor of the Fontan approach is its current low operative risk, low risk of reoperation, and excellent functional outcomes in most patients.K5 This may be especially relevant given the improved results with the Fontan approach in the presence of two functioning ventricles.J1,P5 The major limitations of the Fontan operation relate to the increasing hazard of ventricular dysfunction and heart failure after 15 to 18 years.F2 Whether this risk will be decreased or neutralized by more current energy-efficient methods of Fontan constructions remains to be determined.J1 It is also important to consider the reality that certain components of these "borderline anatomic variants" (e.g., modest elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance, ventricular hypertrophy, AV valve regurgitation) may represent risk factors for the Fontan operation.

The increasing late risk for reoperation and mortality after Rastelli-type operations for DORV have been well documented.B10,K11 Late morbidity and mortality relate not only to RVOT and extracardiac conduit obstruction but also to progressive LVOT obstruction in the setting of complex intraventricular baffles (see preceding text under Results). However, encouraging early and midterm results are emerging from newer procedures such as the REV procedure,L2 Nikaidoh procedure,N3 and single and double root translocation operations (see also previous discussions under Technique of Operation and Results), as well as modifications of baffling techniques,D6 that provide some optimism for improved late survival and freedom from reoperation.A8 For example, Devaney and colleaguesD6 reported biventricular repairs in 12 patients with AV septal defect with an interventricular communication remote from the aortic valve in the presence of a muscular subaortic infundibulum. There were 11 early and 10 late survivors. Infundibular resection and a complex extended intraventricular baffle contributed to absence of late LV outflow obstruction.

Until appropriate short- and longer-term outcome analyses are available, coupled with experiential insights, selection of one- or two-ventricle strategies for many of these complex variants will remain a function of institutional bias and surgeon preference.
