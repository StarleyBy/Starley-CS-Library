# DEFINITION

This chapter considers true aortic aneurysm, false aortic aneurysm, chronic aortic dissection, penetrating arteriosclerotic ulcer, intramural hematoma, and diffuse arteriosclerotic disease. Methods for protecting the brain during operations on the aortic arch are also discussed.

*True aortic aneurysm* is a permanent localized dilatation of the aorta, of a diameter 50% or greater than normal, contained by walls that although attenuated, have all layers of the normal wall.J5 *False aortic aneurysm* is a localized dilatation whose wall consists of adventitia, some or all of the media, and compressed periaortic tissue. *Chronic aortic dissection* is a separation for more than 14 days of the outer from the inner layer of the media, caused by blood leaving the normal aortic channel through a point of exit (intimal tear). *Penetrating arteriosclerotic ulcer* is an arteriosclerotic lesion that penetrates the internal elastic lamina of the aortic wall. *Intramural hematoma* is an extravasation of blood into the aortic wall, commonly in the absence of an intimal disruption. *Diffuse arteriosclerotic disease* is sessile, mobile, or pedunculated atheroma involving lipid deposition in large areas of the intimal layer of the aorta.

### HISTORICAL NOTE

An important contribution to modern aneurysm surgery was made by Rudolph Matas in New Orleans in 1902 when he described the basic maneuver of "getting inside the aneurysm" with minimal external dissection and after obtaining control of the artery above and below the aneurysm.M7 Interestingly, this basic maneuver was ignored as aortic aneurysm surgery began to develop, and in early work with abdominal aortic aneurysms at the Mayo Clinic, the aneurysm was dissected away from surrounding tissues, often with a long and difficult operation and considerable hemorrhage from lumbar arteries.K10 DeBakey and Cooley described this same tedious method in their classic paper of 1953.D7 Javid and colleagues in 1962 and Creech in 1966 are generally credited with reintroducing the technique of working within the aneurysm.C51,J2 However, DeBakey and colleagues in Houston had reintroduced this concept into abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery by 1958.C48 The inclusion technique of sewing the graft in place from within the aneurysm is an embodiment of this concept.C43

Throughout the first half of the 20th century, sporadic attempts were made to treat aortic aneurysms, almost all in the abdominal aorta. Treatment was by proximal partial or complete ligation of the aorta. Results were generally unsatisfactory.D13 Various other palliative procedures had also been used unsuccessfully. In 1950, Estes at the Mayo Clinic published a classic paper that demonstrated the poor prognosis of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms, only 50% of whom survived 3 years after diagnosis, with two thirds of the deaths attributable to aneurysmal rupture.E12 In response to that study, the Mayo Clinic began a surgical approach to this condition in 1951, and in 1953 reported the results of aneurysm reinforcement and the tedious operation of aortoplasty and complete wrapping with fascia lata.K10 In 1952, Schafer and Hardin in Kansas City reported resection and grafting with an aortic allograft of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, only to have the patient die of numerous complications 28 days after operation.S9 In that same year, Dubost and colleagues, working in Paris, reported the first successful case of aortic resection for aneurysm and restoration of blood vessel continuity (in their case, an abdominal aortic aneurysm that was approached retroperitoneally and replaced by a preserved aortic allograft).D22 In 1953, reports of similar successes came from DeBakey and Cooley in Houston and from the Mayo Clinic.D7,H6,K10 Aortic allograft banks were subsequently established in some centers to provide aortic replacement grafts.G17,G18,M20,P5

In 1944, Alexander and Byron successfully resected a thoracic aortic aneurysm secondary to coarctation, although without restoration of aortic continuity.A8 Aortic allografts were developed in 1948 by Gross and colleagues in Boston to replace resected aortic segments.G17,G18,P5 On May 24, 1948, they resected a coarctation in a 7-year-old boy, restoring aortic continuity with an aortic allograft. When the clamps were released, the distal vasculature dilated, and the patient became hypotensive and died. This led to a recommendation to slowly release the clamps following repair of aortic coarctation.G17,G18 They performed four more allograft replacements of the aorta for coarctation in 1948, five in 1949, and eight in 1950, including the first frozen and irradiated graft, which functioned for at least 30 years (Dr. Robert Replogle, personal communication, July 19, 2002). In 1950, Swan and colleagues also reported successful clinical use of allografts for treating complex coarctations, including those with aneurysms.S31 Adopting this technique, Lam and Aram in 1951 reported resection and allograft replacement of a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm in an adult.L3 Prophetically, paraparesis developed in their patient, who died 6 weeks after operation of empyema. About this time, Bahnson reported successful management of a saccular aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta by lateral resection and aortorrhaphy.B2 In 1953, DeBakey and Cooley reported the first successful application of resection and grafting to a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm.D8

Ascending aortic aneurysms were also approached surgically before the advent of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In 1952, Cooley and DeBakey reported removal of sacciform ascending aortic aneurysms by lateral resection and aortorrhaphy, as did Bahnson and Johnston and colleagues in 1953.B2,C22,J4 In 1956, Cooley and DeBakey reported the first successful modern operation for ascending aortic aneurysm, consisting of resecting the ascending aorta and grafting with an aortic allograft, with the aid of CPB.C23 Wheat and colleagues then reported successful simultaneous but separate replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve with reimplantation of the coronary ostia into the graft.W6 Bentall and De Bono in 1968 and Edwards and Kerr in 1970 reported accomplishing this replacement with a composite valve and polyester tube graft.B6,E2 Wheat and colleagues subsequently demonstrated long-term patency of their anastomoses between grafts and coronary ostia.W5

Aneurysms of the arch of the aorta presented a more difficult surgical challenge. By 1952, Cooley and DeBakey had removed some sacciform aneurysms in this portion of the aorta by lateral resection, as had Bahnson by 1953.B2,C22 The next year, DeBakey and Cooley reported successful resection of the distal aortic arch and replacement by a graft for an aneurysm that had resulted from acute traumatic aortic transection.D8 The case is of interest in that the patient's temperature was reduced to 28°C by surface cooling before thoracotomy. The aorta was clamped proximal to the left subclavian artery (which was also individually clamped) for 1 hour, and paraplegia did not develop (see "Paraplegia" under Special Situations and Controversies in Chapter 24 for the significance of this finding). In 1955, Cooley and colleagues reported unsuccessful resection of an aneurysm of the entire aortic arch, using the cumbersome method of temporary shunts without CPB, as did Stranahan and colleagues in a 15-hour operation in 1955 and Creech and colleagues in 1956.C24,C52,S20 In 1957, DeBakey and colleagues reported the first successful repair of an aortic arch aneurysm using CPB and allograft replacement.D10

Thoracoabdominal aneurysms also presented difficult surgical challenges, not only because of the magnitude of the operation but also the propensity of patients to develop renal and spinal cord dysfunction after repair.C48 In 1952 during Bahnson's pioneering work with aneurysms of the aorta, he successfully repaired a saccular thoracoabdominal aneurysm by lateral resection and aortorrhaphy.B2 Ellis and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic first reported repair of such an aneurysm involving a visceral artery (in their case, the renal artery) by resection and grafting in 1955.E6 Etheredge and colleagues reported successful repair of a more complex thoracoabdominal aneurysm including the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery in the same year.E14 In 1956, DeBakey and colleagues reported successful repair of such an aneurysm involving all the visceral arteries (celiac, superior mesenteric, and both renals).D12 Subsequently, they devised the technique of permanent aortic bypass with a synthetic graft and visceral arterial reattachment to appropriately located side-arm grafts, and in 1965 they reported 26% mortality among 42 patients.D11 Crawford and colleagues modified and simplified the operation by applying the inclusion technique, reducing hospital mortality to 8% by 1978.C38,C48

During this developmental phase, there was controversy about the lethality of thoracic aortic aneurysms. Some reports indicated that patients with thoracic aneurysms fared better than those with abdominal aneurysms.L6 In 1964, Joyce and colleagues established that this was not the case.J6

A series of technical improvements evolved into many of the techniques currently used for surgical treatment of thoracic aortic aneurysms. Even after successful repair of aneurysms of the arch had been accomplished using CPB, methods remained complex, often involving separate cannulation of the brachiocephalic arteries. In 1964, Borst and colleagues reported repair of a traumatic aneurysm of the distal portion of the aortic arch through a left thoracotomy, using CPB to produce profound hypothermia and performing the repair during an interval of circulatory arrest.B19

In 1975, Griepp and colleagues established the value of profoundly hypothermic circulatory arrest for resecting and grafting of more proximal and more extensive aneurysms of the aortic arch.G15

Among the technical improvements was use of a single anastomosis between an oval opening in the graft and the aortic wall around all three brachiocephalic arteries in replacing aortic arch aneurysms, reported by Bloodwell and colleagues in 1968 and by Pearce and colleagues the following year.B15,P4 Later, Ott and colleagues reported tailoring the arch resection and graft so that a single distal anastomosis could be made.O8 Crawford and Saleh applied the inclusion technique to arch aneurysms, working entirely within the aneurysm and wrapping the graft with aneurysm wall.C47

Technical improvements have also been made in the aortic replacement devices required for treating aortic aneurysms and dissections. Dubost and others in the early surgical period used preserved aortic allografts.D22,G17,G18,L3,M20,S31 Soon the search for synthetic aortic substitutes was revived despite the unsuccessful pioneering efforts of Carrel and others.C7 The first satisfactory synthetic aortic substitute was a fabric tube made of polyvinyl chloride cloth, and the first clinical application of this device was reported by Blakemore and Voorhees in New York City in 1954.B13 Shumacker and King in Indianapolis also used these fabric tubes for aortic replacement in the same year.S14 For the next several years, surgeons autoclaved and used fabric grafts made on the sewing machines of wives and friends, with generally good results. Intensive study of prosthetic grafts was quickly undertaken by several groups, and in 1955, Deterling and Bhonslay reported that polyester was the best material then available for aortic replacement.D14 Knitted and woven grafts of various types, mostly polyester, have been widely used since then. Subsequent development of polyester grafts impregnated with collagen, gelatin, or albumin has resulted in a substantial reduction in blood loss through the grafts (particularly in fully heparinized patients), a major cause of postoperative morbidity (see "Grafts for Use in Aortic Surgery" under Special Situations and Controversies in Chapter 24.)

Stent-grafting of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms was introduced by Dake and colleagues at Stanford University in the early 1990s using custom-designed grafts.D3 Since then, a number of commercially developed grafts have become available for clinical use.

# MORPHOLOGY AND MORPHOGENESIS

#### Classification

Diseases of the thoracic aorta that are amenable to surgical treatment are listed in Box 26-1. Acute traumatic aortic transection and acute ascending and descending aortic dissection are discussed in Chapters 24 and 25.

#### *Aneurysm*

Aneurysm is the most common condition of the thoracic aorta that requires surgical treatment. This category includes congenital or developmental, degenerative, chronic traumatic, inflammatory, infectious, mechanical, and anastomotic aneurysms.

**Congenital or Developmental** Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from mutations in the FNB1 gene that lead to defective synthesis of the glycoprotein fibrillin (a component of elastic tissue in the medial layer of the aorta). The aorta becomes aneurysmal as a result of a reduced number of microfibrils in this layer.F6 The dilated aortic segments are prone to rupture or dissection.

Loeys-Dietz syndrome is an autosomal dominant aortic aneurysm disorder with involvement of other systems.L13 It results from mutations in either the transforming growth factor receptor type I or II (TGFBR1 or TGFBR2) genes. The majority of patients have aortic root aneurysms that result in aortic dissection. These patients also develop aneurysms of other vessels.L13

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome comprises a group of heterogeneous conditions characterized by various defects in the synthesis of type III collagen.B25 Development of aneurysms is

uncommon, but rupture or dissection of the aorta or other arteries (often abdominal) can occur as a catastrophic event. Tissue fragility and poor healing can complicate surgical treatment.A12 Ehlers-Danlos type IV (vascular form) is generally sporadic, but when familial is usually an autosomal dominant disorder.

Other genetically mediated conditions associated with aneurysm development and aortic dissection include Turner syndrome, Beals syndrome (contractual arachnodactyly), Noonan syndrome, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and the nonvascular form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.A5,L4,M18,S12,W3

**Degenerative** Cystic medial degeneration is the most frequent pathologic condition that results in aneurysms of the ascending aorta.O5 Characteristic features are fragmentation and loss of elastic tissue and loss of smooth muscle cells. Inflammation and apoptosis may be components of this process as well.H7 Enlargement is usually confined to the proximal portion of the ascending aorta. Dilatation of the sinuses of Valsalva and aortic anulus (anuloaortic ectasia) may result in aortic regurgitation. (See "Anuloaortic Ectasia" under Morphology in Chapter 12 for discussion of this entity in patients with aortic valve regurgitation.)

Degenerative aneurysms, often associated with arteriosclerosis of the aorta, are the most frequently occurring aneurysms of the thoracic and abdominal aorta and most commonly involve the descending thoracic or thoracoabdominal segments.C41,C56 Abnormal proteolysis, presence of elastolytic serum enzymes, and deficiencies of collagen and elastin have been implicated as factors contributing to development of these aneurysms.B21,B24,C4,N2,R2 Although atheromatous changes are frequently present in and around such aneurysms, the causative role of arteriosclerosis in their development is not clearly established.C41,E11,J5

**Chronic Posttraumatic** Aneurysms resulting from blunt trauma most frequently involve the proximal descending thoracic aorta and may present many years after the acute injury. When neither death nor operation follows the acute transection, disruption of at least part of the aortic circumference, usually at the level of the ligamentum arteriosum, results in extravasation of blood into the periaortic tissues (see Chapter 24). This blood may remain in communication with the aorta and form a pulsating hematoma that is contained by aortic adventitia or the mediastinal tissues. The resulting false aneurysm may enlarge and rupture from increased wall stress (Laplace law). Chronic posttraumatic aneurysms represent a small percentage of patients with aneurysms of the thoracic aorta.

**Inflammatory** Patients with Takayasu arteritis, Behçet disease, Kawasaki disease, and giant cell arteritis may develop aneurysms of the thoracic aorta that require surgical treatment.A6,A14,D1,E15,I1,I2,K11,T1,W4 Other inflammatory disorders, such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, polyarteritis nodosa, and Reiter syndrome, may result in dilatation of the aortic root and aortic valve regurgitation that require surgical intervention.I2

**Infected** Primary infected (mycotic) aneurysms of the thoracic aorta are rare. A frequent cause is direct deposition of circulating bacteria in a diseased, arteriosclerotic, or traumatized aortic intima following an episode of endocarditis or infection of an aortic jet lesion.F3,G4 Infection of intraluminal clot in a preexisting degenerative aneurysm may occur after an episode of bacteremia or other infectious process.C10 Organisms can also infect previously inserted prosthetic grafts, causing false aneurysms. Other risk factors for development of infected aneurysm include congenital cardiac or vascular defects, trauma, and impaired immunity.B22,G4,G16 *Staphylococcus aureus* is the most frequent causative organism, followed by *Staphylococcus epidermidis, Salmonella*, and *Streptococcus* species.B22,C10,M24,O10 Infected aneurysms may be multifocal.

**Mechanical** Aneurysmal changes can occur in the aorta distal to stenotic aortic valves and aortic coarctation and proximal to arteriovenous fistulae. Dilatation of the ascending aorta in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve and of the descending thoracic aorta in patients with aortic coarctation is more likely the result of structural abnormalities of the aortic wall rather than turbulent flow produced by the stenotic lesions.L10

**Anastomotic** Aneurysms (usually of the false type) can develop at the site of aorta-to-aorta or aorta-to-graft anastomoses.

#### *False Aneurysm*

False aneurysms are most commonly associated with trauma, infection, and previous operations on the aorta.

#### *Chronic Aortic Dissection*

Morphologic features of acute aortic dissection, including classification, are discussed in Chapter 25. When the false lumen persists after an acute aortic dissection, as it usually does, its outer wall, consisting of the outer layer of the media and the adventitia, has a tendency to weaken and enlarge. A saccular or fusiform aneurysm may result. Chronic aortic dissection with persisting false lumen is a common substrate for development of chronic thoracic or thoracoabdominal aneurysms.

# *Penetrating Arteriosclerotic Ulcer*

Arteriosclerotic lesions involving the intimal layer of the aorta may ulcerate and penetrate the internal elastic lamina of the aortic wall (Fig. 26-1). Penetrating arteriosclerotic ulcers occur most commonly in the descending thoracic aorta.C20,H4 They can result in separation of the layers of the media and formation of intramural hematoma.H15,S17 Saccular and fusiform aneurysms may develop, and dissection, rupture, and embolization can occur.

# *Intramural Hematoma*

Intramural hematoma can occur in the absence of an intimal tear and may result in dissectionL14,N6,R3,Y1 (Figs. 26-2 and 26-3). Rupture of an arteriosclerotic plaque and spontaneous rupture of vasa vasora have been postulated as mechanisms for development of the hematoma.G6

# *Diffuse Arteriosclerotic Disease*

Sessile, mobile, or pedunculated atheroma is an important risk factor for stroke after operations that require cannulating and clamping the ascending aorta or aortic archB14,K4,W1,W2 (Fig. 26-4). Severe arteriosclerosis of the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending thoracic aorta is also an important cause of embolic stroke and embolization to the abdominal organs and lower extremities in patients who do not undergo cardiac or thoracic surgical procedures.A9,K8 In some situations, the latter condition is amenable to surgical treatment.M23,R8,S32

#### Prevalence

During the first half of the 20th century, thoracic aneurysms were far more common than abdominal aneurysms because of the predominance of syphilitic aneurysms. In 1952, the ratio of thoracic to abdominal aortic aneurysms was 2:1 in autopsy studies.M3 By 1964, this ratio had declined to less than 1:1, primarily as a result of the decline in syphilitic aneurysms.C6 In a study from England and Wales that examined mortality statistics, the number of deaths resulting from thoracic aneurysms increased 17% between 1974 and 1984.F5 This increase was substantially less than that for abdominal aneurysms (53%).

Prevalence of thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms is difficult to determine because of underreporting of these aneurysms in mortality statistics.G3 Between 1958 and 1985 in Malmo, Sweden, which has a stable urban population and an autopsy prevalence of 83%, thoracic aortic aneurysms were found in 489 per 100,000 autopsies in men and 437 per 100,000 autopsies in women.S23 Prevalence of asymptomatic thoracic aneurysms was about 400 per 100,000 autopsies in 65-year-olds and about 670 per 100,000 autopsies in 80-year-olds. In a study by Bickerstaff and colleagues in Rochester, Minnesota, the prevalence of thoracic aneurysms between 1951 and 1980 was 5.9 per 100,000 population per year.B11 In a subsequent study from the same institution, prevalence of thoracic aneurysms between 1980 and 1994

had increased to 10.4 per 100,000 population per year.C16 A study of the entire population of Sweden by Olsson and colleaguesO7 from 1987 to 2002 found the prevalence of thoracic aortic disease (nonruptured or ruptured thoracic aneurysm, acute or chronic aortic dissection) to be 10.7 per 100,000 per year for men and 7.1 per 100,000 for women in 1987. By 2002, the prevalence had increased to 16.3 per 100,000 per year for men and 9.1 per 100,000 per year for women. The number of operations on the thoracic aorta increased sevenfold over this interval for men and 15-fold for women.

Penetrating arteriosclerotic ulcer and intramural aortic hematoma without an intimal tear are being diagnosed with increasing frequency, primarily because of aging of the population and more frequent use of imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Among older patients who undergo cardiac surgical procedures, moderate or severe arteriosclerosis of the ascending aorta and aortic arch is present in approximately 15% to 20% of those older than 50 years and 33% of those 80 years of age or older.W2

## Location

The true anatomic distribution of thoracic aortic aneurysms is not known with certainty. In 72 individuals with aneurysms, Bickerstaff and colleagues found that 37 (51%) involved the ascending aorta, 8 (11%) the aortic arch, and 27 (38%) the descending thoracic aorta.B11 The cause was aortic dissection in 53%, degenerative disease in 29%, aortitis in 8%, cystic medial necrosis in 6%, and syphilis in 4%. Svensjo and colleagues found that thoracoabdominal aneurysms made up 5% of asymptomatic thoracic aneurysms.S23

## CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

#### Symptoms

Many patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms are asymptomatic at presentation, and the aneurysms are detected during testing for other disorders. Symptoms relating to the aneurysm usually develop later in the course of enlargement of the aorta and result from impingement of the aneurysm on

![](_page_5_Picture_11.jpeg)

adjacent structures. Patients with aneurysms involving the ascending aorta associated with dilatation of the aortic anulus frequently present with symptoms referable to the aortic regurgitation that develops as a result of progressive aortic enlargement. Patients with aneurysms of the aortic arch may present with pain in the neck and jaw. Hoarseness results from stretching of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, stridor from compression of the trachea, dysphagia from impingement on the lumen of the esophagus, dyspnea from compression of the lung parenchyma, and plethora and edema from compression of the superior vena cava. Patients with aneurysms of the descending thoracic aorta may report pain in the interscapular area or left-sided pleuritic pain. Aneurysms of the thoracoabdominal aorta may be associated with back pain, abdominal pain, and pain in the left shoulder resulting from irritation of the left hemidiaphragm.

Acute onset of severe pain in the anterior part of the chest or neck or between the shoulders is the typical presenting symptom of acute aortic dissection, although it may occur with rupture or sudden expansion of a chronic dissecting or nondissecting aneurysm (see Chapter 25). Acute chest pain may also result from a nondissecting intramural hematoma of the aorta or erosion of a penetrating arteriosclerotic ulcer into the surrounding tissues. Stroke or evidence of ischemia of the kidneys, abdominal viscera, and lower extremities may result from embolization of atheroma or thrombus from a severely arteriosclerotic aorta.

#### Signs

Direct physical signs of the presence of a thoracic aortic aneurysm are uncommon. In earlier times, a pulsating mass of the anterior chest was the first evidence of a syphilitic aneurysm of the ascending aorta; rarely, such an aneurysm eroded the sternum and ruptured, resulting in fatal hemorrhage. Signs of aortic regurgitation (bounding peripheral pulses, an aortic diastolic murmur) may be present in patients with large ascending aortic aneurysms that involve the aortic sinuses. A pulsatile mass in the upper abdomen may be present in patients with thoracoabdominal aneurysms. Evidence for embolization of atheroma or thrombus from an aneurysm or from a severely arteriosclerotic aorta to the lower extremities (blue toe syndrome) may occasionally be the first indication of severe aortic disease.

## Diagnostic Techniques

## *Chest Radiography*

Findings on the chest radiograph may be diagnostic of a thoracic aortic aneurysm. Ascending aortic aneurysms produce a convex shadow to the right of the cardiac silhouette (Fig. 26-5), those of the arch an anterior and left-sided shadow (Fig. 26-6), and those of the descending aorta a shadow to the left and posteriorly (Fig. 26-7). However, approximately 17% of patients with documented aneurysms or dissections have no abnormalities on chest radiography.E1 Pooled data place the sensitivity of detecting a widened mediastinum or abnormal aortic contour in patients with aortic dissection at 64% and 71%, respectively.K13 Substantial enlargement of the ascending aorta may be confined to the retrosternal area, so that the aortic silhouette appears normal. Aneurysms that involve the ascending aorta and aortic arch cannot always be differentiated from tumors or other masses.C11,E1

![](_page_6_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Figure 26-5** Chest radiograph of patient with anuloaortic ectasia and aneurysm of ascending aorta, showing typical convex deformity to the right in the frontal view.

# *Computed Tomography*

CT is the most widely used noninvasive technique for diagnosing thoracic aortic disease. It provides information about size, location, and extent of disease (Fig. 26-8). It is of particular value in documenting the growth rate of aneurysms, determining timing of operative intervention in asymptomatic patients, and evaluating patients postoperatively.D5,G14,H11,T3 It is useful in identifying anatomic variants and branch vessel involvement, and provides threedimensional (3D) data (Fig. 26-9). Because approximately 25% of patients have aneurysms in more than one area of the aorta, both the thoracic and the abdominal aorta should be examined.B11,P10 CT is also useful for detecting intramural hematoma (see Fig. 26-2) and penetrating arteriosclerotic ulcers, and for determining severity and extent of thickening of the aortic wall in patients with severe aortic arteriosclerosis.C11,C20,L14,N6 It is of particular value in diagnosing thoracic aortic dissection.C37,P7 The principal disadvantage of CT is that it requires use of contrast medium for precise delineation of aortic disease, which may be contraindicated in patients with allergies to contrast agents or with renal insufficiency.

Radiation-induced malignancy in patients with thoracic aortic disease who require periodic CT imaging is a concern. Techniques to reduce radiation exposure (e.g., appropriate shielding, radiation dose reduction and management, algorithms to improve system efficiency) have been implemented to minimize this risk.M10

## *Magnetic Resonance Imaging*

MRI is emerging as a premier imaging method for diagnosing diseases of the thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta.L11,M17 Standard techniques do not require contrast agents (Fig. 26-10, *A*). In certain applications, a single study can provide

![](_page_7_Picture_2.jpeg)

information similar to that obtained from a combination of echocardiography, CT, and angiography. It provides excellent imaging of aortic dissections and can accurately identify thrombus formation and sites of entry.N4,N5 It can also differentiate periaortic hematoma from thrombosis of a false aneurysm. Breath-holding and 3D magnetic resonance angiography permit examination of the entire thoracic aorta, its major branches, the pericardium, the aortic valve, and the

contractile pattern of the left ventricle.H5 Contrast-enhanced, time-resolved, 3D magnetic resonance angiography using agents such as gadolinium provide excellent images of the aorta and its major branches, comparable with those obtained by conventional aortography (Fig. 26-10, *B*).

Compared with CT, current disadvantages of MRI include a longer time to complete the study, greater cost, inaccessibility to patients who are connected to ventilators

and monitoring devices, contraindication in patients with metallic implants, pacemakers, and defibrillators, and limited availability. Use of MRI with a contrast agent (gadolinium compounds) is associated with a risk of nephrogenic systemic sclerosis.

# *Transesophageal Echocardiography*

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) with Doppler color flow imaging is being used with increasing frequency for diagnosing thoracic aortic disease and caring for patients who undergo operations on the thoracic aorta.B23 It is superior to transthoracic echocardiography for these purposes. It can be performed rapidly, with minimal morbidity, and has

**Figure 26-10** Magnetic resonance images of aneurysm of ascending aorta and aortic arch. **A,** Sagittal spin-echo image. **B,** Gadolinium-enhanced image.

emerged as the most useful and accurate technique for diagnosing acute aortic dissection (see Chapter 25).A3,E8

Before and during operations on the thoracic aorta, TEE is invaluable for assessing presence of arteriosclerosis, including mobile or pedunculated atheroma in the thoracic aorta, hemopericardium, malperfusion, competency of the aortic valve before CPB is established, and adequacy of reparative procedures on the valve.B23 It also provides information about ventricular function and function of the mitral and tricuspid valves.

Disadvantages of TEE include lack of availability at small centers and during off hours, need for sedation, and occasionally endotracheal intubation.

## *Aortography*

Aortography can be performed in patients who are to undergo elective operations on the thoracic aorta. It provides information about location of aneurysms, particularly in relation to major branches of the aorta in the chest and upper abdomen (Fig. 26-11). It also defines areas of relatively normal aorta proximal and distal to aneurysms. It can detect presence of

**Figure 26-11** Thoracic aortograms of patient with moderately large fusiform aortic arch aneurysm.

aortic regurgitation. Selective injections of the coronary, brachiocephalic, visceral, and renal arteries provide important information that permits more accurate assessment of operative risk and may demonstrate need for modifications in operative technique.C53

A disadvantage of aortography is that the size of large aneurysms may be underestimated because of the presence of thrombus. Other disadvantages include risk of allergic reactions after injection of contrast medium and risk of renal failure in patients with impaired renal function.N5 Multidetector CT has largely replaced angiography for anatomic studies that are required for treating and monitoring aortic disease.B5

# *Epiaortic Ultrasonography*

Intraoperative epiaortic ultrasound imaging of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta is useful for detecting arteriosclerosis. Presence of severe arteriosclerosis, including mobile or pedunculated atheroma, may necessitate alterations in surgical technique to avoid embolization of atheromatous debris to the brain and other organs during cardiac and thoracic aortic operations (see Fig. 26-4, *A*). Epiaortic imaging is more accurate than palpation of the aorta and, in comparative studies, more accurate than TEE for detecting atheromatous disease in the ascending aorta.D6,W8

# Preoperative Evaluation

Because myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, renal failure, and stroke are the principal causes of mortality and morbidity after operations on the thoracic aorta, preoperative assessment of the function of these organ systems is essential.K28,S7,S27

## *Cardiac Function*

Because of the high prevalence of ischemic heart disease in older individuals, particularly those with degenerative aneurysms, assessment of cardiac function is necessary when elective operation is contemplated, especially for those with a history of myocardial infarction or angina pectoris and those older than 50 years. Patients with symptoms or electrocardiographic (ECG) changes indicative of myocardial ischemia should undergo stress testing and coronary angiography when indicated. Patients with valvar heart disease are evaluated with echocardiography and cardiac catheterization. Clinically important coronary artery disease should be treated with percutaneous catheter interventional techniques or bypass grafting, and valvar heart disease by valve repair or replacement before or, in some cases, at the time of the procedure on the thoracic aorta.

#### *Pulmonary Function*

History of smoking and presence of chronic pulmonary disease are important predictors of respiratory failure, and they are frequently present in patients who require operations on the descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta.C2,K23,S7 Pulmonary function tests should be performed in patients with these risk factors. Spirometric tests and arterial blood gas analysis should be performed in patients with chronic pulmonary disease.C2 If reversible restrictive disease or excessive sputum production is present, antibiotics and bronchodilators should be administered preoperatively. Cessation of smoking is advisable.

#### **Renal Function**

Preoperative renal dysfunction is the most important predictor of acute renal failure after operations on the thoracic aorta. K3,M14,S3,S7 Although creatinine and blood urea nitrogen are routinely measured preoperatively, their predictive value for postoperative renal failure is limited. Preoperative hydration and avoidance of intravenous contrast agents, hypotension, low cardiac output, and hypovolemia in the perioperative period are important mechanisms for reducing the prevalence of this complication.

# Neurologic Function

To minimize risk of stroke or reversible ischemic neurologic deficits, duplex imaging of the carotid arteries and angiography of the brachiocephalic and intracranial arteries, when indicated, should be performed preoperatively in patients with a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or other risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. B7 Patients with greater than 80% to 90% stenosis of one or both common or internal carotid arteries should be considered for carotid endarterectomy or stenting before elective operations on the thoracic aorta.

#### **NATURAL HISTORY**

## Aneurysm

In contrast to the extensive data on the natural history of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms that have not been surgically treated, substantially less information is available for thoracic aortic aneurysms. This is primarily due to the lack (until recent times) of a widely available noninvasive diagnostic test that can accurately measure the size of thoracic aneurysms.

In three of the largest studies of thoracic aortic aneurysms, which include 264 patients who had not undergone operative treatment at the time of diagnosis, rupture of the aneurysm was the most common cause of death, occurring in 42% to 70% of patients. B11,P6,P10 In all three series, rupture of chronic dissecting aneurysms substantially exceeded that of nondissecting aneurysms. Five-year survival ranged from 13% to 39%. Survival for patients with thoracic, thoracoabdominal, and abdominal aneurysms in the study of Perko and colleagues is shown in Fig. 26-12. In two studies of patients with thoracoabdominal aneurysms who did not undergo operative treatment, rupture of the aneurysm was also the most common cause of death. C44,P6

Other studies have focused on rates of growth and influence of the size of thoracic aortic aneurysms on the probability of rupture. D4,D5,H10,H11 In an analysis of 171 patients with serial CT images of aortic aneurysms, Hirose and colleagues found that thoracic aneurysms enlarged more rapidly than abdominal aneurysms (0.42 vs. 0.28 cm · year<sup>-1</sup>). H11 Aneurysms of the aortic arch enlarged at the fastest rate (0.56 cm · year<sup>-1</sup>). Similar findings were reported by Griepp and colleagues. G14 Size of a thoracic aneurysm at initial evaluation appears to be the most important predictor of rupture. Aneurysms that are 5 to 6 cm in diameter have a faster rate of growth and a greater propensity for rupture than smaller ones. D4,D5,G14,H10,P6 In the study by Perko and colleagues, the cumulative 5-year hazard for rupture increased fivefold for thoracic aneurysms that were 6 cm or greater in diameter. P6 Rupture is often preceded by symptoms. Bickerstaff and

**Figure 26-12** Survival of patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms (*TAA*; n = 57), thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (*T-AAA*; n = 53), and abdominal aortic aneurysms (*AAA*; n = 60) who did not undergo operative treatment. (From Perko and colleagues. <sup>P6</sup>)

colleagues reported that once symptoms developed, the mean time to rupture was 2 years.  $^{\rm B11}$ 

Medical treatment is of limited value in managing thoracic aneurysms. Control of systemic hypertension, when present, is important to reduce wall stress even though no clear correlation between expansion rate of thoracic aneurysms and presence of hypertension has been demonstrated. D4 Hypertension is a risk factor for aortic enlargement and need for reoperation after repair of type A aortic dissection, however.<sup>Z1</sup> Administration of β-adrenergic blocking agents decreases progression of aortic dilatation in Marfan syndrome patients and may slow the rate of aortic dilatation in those with chronic aortic dissection in the absence of this syndrome. G1,S13 Angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may slow the growth rate of aneurysms in patients with Marfan syndrome. B20,L1 Whether these agents can similarly affect other diseases of the aorta is unknown. Although statin therapy has been associated with decreased long-term mortality in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms, no similar effect has been observed in patients with thoracic aneurysms. D18 No prospective trials have demonstrated a beneficial effect of cessation of smoking on rates of progression of thoracic aortic disease.

#### Other Conditions

The natural history of penetrating arteriosclerotic ulcers is variable. In the largest reported series, the majority of ulcers detected by CT imaging were not associated with symptoms and remained stable or regressed. C15,Q2 A small percentage progressively enlarged, with formation of saccular aneurysms. Intramural hematoma, dissection, embolization, and rupture can also occur. H4,M21

Intramural hematoma is a dynamic entity that may regress, expand, or progress to aortic dissection. Its natural history varies according to location of the hematoma in the thoracic

aorta and geographic location. A higher prevalence of dissection and death has been observed among patients with hematomas in the ascending aorta and arch than in those with hematomas in the descending aorta.C17,S15,T8 The experience from Asia suggests more frequent resolution of the hematomas with conservative management than that reported from Western countries.N6

Patients with severe arteriosclerotic plaques (>4 mm in thickness) involving the ascending aorta and aortic arch have a high prevalence of atheromatous emboli in the cerebral circulation.B14 These emboli are probably a major cause of cerebral infarction.A10,B14 Patients with severe ascending aortic arteriosclerosis are at risk for embolization and stroke after manipulation of the ascending aorta during coronary artery bypass grafting and other cardiac surgical procedures.B14,T5,W1,W2 When severe atheromatous disease is present in the distal aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta, embolization to the visceral, renal, and peripheral arteries can occur.

Among patients with the conditions just described, death due to coexisting cardiovascular disease is common.

# TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

## Preparations for Thoracic and Thoracoabdominal Aortic Surgery

After anesthesia induction, venous access is obtained with a large-bore central catheter and several large peripheral catheters. A radial arterial catheter is inserted for monitoring blood pressure and withdrawing blood samples. This is placed in the left radial artery in patients with ascending aortic and proximal arch disease, and in the right radial artery in patients with descending thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic disease. If chronic aortic dissection is present and the potential for malperfusion exists (see "Malperfusion Syndromes" under Special Situations and Controversies in Chapter 25), a second arterial catheter is placed in a femoral artery or the opposite radial artery. If entrance into the left chest after a median sternotomy is anticipated, or if a lateral thoracotomy or thoracoabdominal incision is used, a double lumen endotracheal tube is inserted. Alternatively, an occlusive balloon can be placed through a single-lumen endotracheal tube. Leads II and V5 of the ECG are continuously monitored. A pulmonary artery catheter is placed to measure pulmonary artery pressure, oxygen saturation, and cardiac output. Thermistor probes are placed for measuring nasopharyngeal and bladder temperature. If an interval of hypothermic circulatory arrest is planned, electroencephalographic monitoring is also necessary, and monitoring of cerebral oxygen saturation is advisable. Cerebrospinal fluid drainage is performed in patients with extensive descending thoracic aortic disease and thoracoabdominal aneurysms.S4 TEE is performed intraoperatively to assess function of the cardiac valves, size of the aorta, and type and extent of aortic disease, and to monitor myocardial function.B23

## Ascending Aorta Replacement

#### *Aneurysm*

The aneurysmal segment of the ascending aorta is excised and replaced with a tube graft. When the aortic valve is diseased and requires repair or replacement, the techniques are those described under Technique of Operation in Chapter 12. A full median sternotomy or a partial upper sternotomy is used. If the aneurysm does not involve the distal ascending aorta or proximal aortic arch, these sites can be used for cannulation (Fig. 26-13, *A*). If this is not possible, the common femoral artery or axillary artery may be used for arterial return from the pump-oxygenator.S1 A single two-stage venous cannula is inserted into the right atrium. After CPB is established, a venting catheter is inserted through the right superior pulmonary vein, although this is not always necessary. A balloon-tipped catheter is inserted into the right atrium and positioned in the coronary sinus for delivery of retrograde cardioplegia (see Fig. 26-13, *A*). Moderate hemodilution (hematocrit 20%-30%) and moderate systemic hypothermia (28°C-32°C) are used.

A standard approach involves replacing the ascending aorta from the level of the aortic commissures to just proximal to the brachiocephalic artery. The aorta is clamped proximal to the origin of the brachiocephalic artery. Cardioplegic solution is administered into the aortic segment proximal to the aortic clamp if there is no aortic regurgitation. Alternatively, it can be infused directly into the coronary arteries after the aorta is incised (see Chapter 3).

The aorta is completely transected just proximal to the aortic clamp and just above the commissures of the aortic valve (Fig. 26-13, *B*). A collagen- or gelatin-impregnated (prepared) woven polyester tube graft of appropriate size is sutured to the distal aorta with a continuous 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture incorporating a 4- to 5-mm strip of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) felt (Fig. 26-13, *C*). Use of the PTFE strip is not essential, but is of value in minimizing blood loss when the aorta is thin. If aortic valve replacement or repair is necessary, this is performed (Fig. 26-13, *D* and *E*). The aortic graft is then cut to the appropriate length and sutured to the proximal aorta with a 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture incorporating a strip of PTFE felt (Fig. 26-13, *F*). If there is appreciable cephalad displacement of the ostium of the right coronary artery, an opening is created in the graft with a wire cautery, the artery is detached from the aorta with a cuff of aortic tissue and sutured to the graft with a 4-0 or 5-0 polypropylene suture incorporating a small strip of PTFE felt.

As the proximal aortic suture line is being completed, suction on the intracardiac vent is discontinued, warm blood cardioplegic solution is administered through the coronary sinus catheter, and CPB flow is reduced to permit filling of the heart and the aortic graft with blood. The lungs are temporarily inflated to facilitate removal of air. A venting needle or catheter is inserted into the graft through a small stab incision and secured with a pledgeted suture and a tourniquet (Fig. 26-13, *F*). After the suture line is completed, controlled aortic root reperfusion can be performed (see "Methods of Myocardial Management during Cardiac Surgery" in Chapter 3). Standard de-airing procedures are carried out, CPB is discontinued, and the cannulae are removed (Fig. 26-13, *G*).

If coronary artery disease that requires bypass grafting is present, anastomoses of grafts to the coronary arteries are performed after infusion of cardioplegic solution. During rewarming, the proximal ends of the bypass grafts are sutured to the aortic graft with 5-0 or 6-0 polypropylene suture after openings in the graft are made with a wire cautery (Fig. 26-13, *H*).

![](_page_12_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 26-13** Ascending aorta replacement. **A,** After cardiopulmonary bypass is established and venting and cardioplegia catheters have been inserted, aorta is clamped just proximal to origin of brachiocephalic artery. **B,** Aorta is transected just proximal to aortic clamp and just above commissures of aortic valve. *Continued*

# *Other Conditions*

Penetrating arteriosclerotic ulcers that result in formation of saccular or fusiform aneurysms in the ascending aorta are treated by resecting the involved segment and replacing it with a polyester graft using the technique described in the preceding text. Managing patients with intramural hematoma involving the ascending aorta is similar to managing patients with ascending aortic dissection (see "Repair of Acute DeBakey Type I or II [Type A] Dissection" in Chapter 25). Severe diffuse arteriosclerosis or mobile atheroma involving the ascending aorta that is encountered during coronary artery bypass grafting or valve replacement can be managed by resection and graft replacement or by endarterectomy.R5,S30 Surgical management of mycotic aneurysms, false aneurysms, and infected grafts is discussed under Special Situations and Controversies later in this chapter.

#### Alternative to Replacement

Resection of a portion of the dilated ascending aorta and closure of the aortotomy longitudinally, with or without external reinforcement (usually with a synthetic graft), is an alternative to resection and graft replacement when the aorta is less than 6 cm in diameter.R4 Rupture of the aorta following aortoplasty has been reported both with and without external reinforcement.B4,D16,R4 Atrophy of the aortic wall beneath an external wrap has also been observed.B4,N1

## Aortic Arch Replacement

Although aortic disease can be confined to the aortic arch (segment of the thoracic aorta that extends from the proximal origin of the brachiocephalic artery to the distal origin of the

left subclavian artery), most aneurysms in this area are associated with aneurysmal disease of the ascending aorta or the adjacent descending thoracic aorta. In rare circumstances, the aneurysm may be localized to a discrete area of the arch with a small opening into the aneurysm from the aortic lumen. Excising the aneurysm and closing the defect in the aortic wall with a synthetic patch may be possible.

Hypothermic circulatory arrest is the most widely used technique for protecting the brain during operations on the aortic arch. The technique is described in "Clinical Methodology of Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest" in Section IV of Chapter 2. Alternative techniques are discussed in "Brain Protection during Operations on the Aortic Arch" under Special Situations and Controversies later in this chapter.

**G,** After cardiopulmonary bypass is discontinued, cannulae and venting catheters are removed. **H,** If coronary artery bypass grafting is performed, 4- to 5-mm openings are made in the aortic graft with a wire cautery, and bypass grafts are sutured to aortic graft with continuous 5-0 or 6-0 polypropylene suture. **Figure 26-13, cont'd**

Because of the increased risk of dislodging and embolizing atheromatous material from retrograde perfusion associated with femoral artery cannulation, axillary artery cannulation is used with increasing frequency for operations that involve the aortic arch.S1 Alternative sites for establishing return of arterial blood from the pump-oxygenator include the ascending aorta, brachiocephalic artery, and carotid artery.H13,J3,U3 Separate cannulae are placed in the superior and inferior venae cavae for venous return to the CPB circuit (Fig. 26-14, *A*). Cooling is initiated immediately after CPB is established, and a venting catheter is inserted into the left ventricle through the right superior pulmonary vein. A balloon-tipped catheter is inserted in the right atrium and positioned in the coronary sinus for delivery of retrograde cardioplegia. The superior vena cava is encircled with a tape that is secured around the cava and the cannula with a tourniquet (see Fig. 26-14, *A*). The ascending aorta is clamped if possible, and if the aortic valve is competent, cardioplegic solution is infused into the aortic root. If the aortic root is opened, cardioplegic solution can be infused directly into the coronary arteries. If coronary artery bypass grafting is required, anastomoses of grafts to the coronary arteries are performed during cooling.

Nasopharyngeal, bladder, and perfusate temperatures are continuously monitored. Temperature gradients between the water bath of the heat exchanger in the CPB circuit and the blood, and between the blood and the tissues, are maintained below 12°C. Hematocrit is maintained between 15% and 20%. During cooling, methylprednisolone (7 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) and

Continuous electroencephalographic monitoring is used, and the head is packed in ice. Because hyperglycemia is associated with an increased prevalence of central nervous system dysfunction following hypothermic circulatory arrest, blood glucose levels are monitored, and insulin is administered intravenously to maintain the blood glucose level below 140 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . S18

When nasopharyngeal temperature reaches 12°C to 14°C, bladder temperature reaches 15°C to 18°C, and the electroencephalogram becomes isoelectric, circulatory arrest can be

safely established.C30 The patient is placed in Trendelenburg position, the superior vena caval cannula is occluded (to distend the venous system of the upper body so that air will not be sucked into the brachiocephalic arteries when the aorta is opened), and perfusion from the CPB circuit is discontinued. From 20% to 25% of the patient's calculated blood volume is withdrawn from the venous line into the reservoir of the oxygenator. The clamp is removed from the ascending aorta. If hypothermic circulatory arrest is the sole means of brain protection (in addition to the agents noted previously), no clamps are placed on the distal aorta or brachiocephalic arteries.

After circulatory arrest is established, the ascending aorta is opened (*dashed line*, Fig. 26-14, *A*) and the incision is extended beneath the brachiocephalic arteries. The extent of aortic disease is assessed (Fig. 26-14, *B*). Aneurysms of the aortic arch vary in size and extent, and techniques of repair vary.

#### *Partial Arch Replacement*

If the aneurysm involves only the proximal portion of the arch (often the disease is contiguous with disease in the ascending aorta), a single anastomosis between the tube graft and the distal aorta can be performed by beveling the incision in the aorta beneath the brachiocephalic arteries (see Fig. 26-14, *B*). A prepared polyester graft of appropriate size is correspondingly beveled and sutured to the distal aorta with a continuous 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture incorporating a 3- to 4-mm strip of PTFE felt (Fig. 26-14, *C* and *D*). As the suture line is being completed on the anterior aspect, a shunt from the arterial line of the perfusion circuit is opened to the venous line, the inferior vena caval cannula is occluded with a clamp, and cold (18°C-20°C) oxygenated blood is infused into the superior vena caval cannula at a flow rate of 350 to 500 mL · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (Fig. 26-14, *E*).K14 The jugular venous pressure is monitored and should not exceed 30 to 35 mm Hg. Flow is continued until the suture line is completed. This maneuver removes air and particulate matter from the brachiocephalic arteries. Flow through the arterial line from the pump-oxygenator (femoral or axillary) is reestablished, and air is evacuated from the distal aorta. The aortic graft is gently massaged to facilitate evacuating any remaining air, a clamp is placed across the graft close to the brachiocephalic artery, and CPB is reestablished (Fig. 26-14, *F*). If the femoral artery has been cannulated, dislodging atheromatous debris into the lumen of the aorta is a concern. Therefore, a perfusion cannula is inserted into the aortic graft through a stab wound and secured, the arterial line from the pumpoxygenator is disconnected from the femoral artery cannula and connected to this cannula, air is evacuated from the graft, the clamp is applied, and flow is established in the antegrade direction. This maneuver substantially reduces the possibility of embolizing atheromatous debris into the brachiocephalic arteries and embolic stroke.K14

Rewarming is accomplished using temperature gradients of 12°C or less between the water bath of the heat exchanger and the blood, and between the blood and the tissues. The perfusate flow is gradually increased to a maximum of 2.4 to 2.6 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> . During rewarming, the aortic graft is anastomosed to the proximal ascending aorta. If aortic valve or aortic root replacement is required, it is performed at this time (see Fig. 26-13, *D* and *E*). If coronary artery bypass grafting has been performed, the grafts are sutured to the aortic graft (see Fig. 26-13, *H*). Procedures for evacuating air and reperfusing the myocardium are identical to those described previously under "Ascending Aorta Replacement." When bladder temperature reaches 36°C, CPB is discontinued and the cannulae are removed.

## *Total Arch Replacement*

If the aneurysm involves the entire aortic arch, the aorta is completely transected distal to the left subclavian artery. During cooling, the left phrenic and left vagus nerves are identified and protected by gentle dissection away from the anterior and posterior surface of the aorta. A prepared polyester graft is sutured to the descending aorta with a 3-0 or 4-0 continuous polypropylene suture incorporating a strip of PTFE felt (Fig. 26-15, *A*). If chronic dissection is present, a portion of the septum between the true and false lumens of the descending thoracic aorta is excised and the graft sutured circumferentially to the outer wall of the aorta. This permits antegrade perfusion of both lumens. The origins of the

**Figure 26-15** Total aortic arch replacement. **A,** After circulatory arrest is established, aorta is transected distal to left subclavian artery *(LSA)*. Aortic graft is sutured to descending thoracic aorta *(DTA)* with continuous 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture incorporating a strip of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) felt. Origins of brachiocephalic arteries are separated from diseased aorta with a small cuff of aortic tissue. **B,** Aortic graft is placed under tension, and an oval segment is excised with a wire cautery.

**C,** Cold oxygenated blood from pump-oxygenator is infused into superior vena cava to remove air and particulate matter from brachiocephalic arteries.

brachiocephalic arteries are separated from the aneurysm with a small cuff of aortic tissue (see Fig. 26-15, *A*). If the layers of the aorta are separated in this area as a result of dissection, they are approximated. The graft is placed under tension, and an oval segment corresponding to the size of the aortic cuff is excised with a wire cautery. The graft is sutured to the cuff of aorta with a continuous 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture incorporating a strip of PTFE felt (Fig. 26-15, *B*). Alternatively, the three brachiocephalic arteries can be individually transacted, and separate prepared polyester grafts can be sutured to these arteries and to openings in the aortic graft (see Fig. 26-15, *B [inset]*). Commercially prepared aortic grafts containing presewn branches are available and eliminate the need for the graft-to-graft anastomoses shown in the Fig. 26-15 inset*.* As the single suture line or the last branch anastomosis is being completed, retrograde brain perfusion is initiated, and the procedure is completed as described in the preceding text on partial arch replacement (Fig. 26-15, *C*-*D*).

If a prolonged period of circulatory arrest is contemplated, the brachiocephalic arteries can be perfused directly or they can be separately clamped, with perfusion of the brain occurring from the cannulated axillary arteryK19 (see "Antegrade Brain Perfusion" under Special Situations and Controversies later in this chapter).

#### *Elephant Trunk Technique*

When the aneurysm involves more than just the very proximal descending thoracic aorta, a two-stage procedure may be considered. Borst and colleagues introduced a useful technique for performing the first stage, the "elephant trunk" procedure.B17 An important modification was introduced by Crawford and colleagues, whose technique is shown in Fig. 26-16. C40 After establishing hypothermic circulatory arrest, the aorta is completely transected just beyond the origin of the left subclavian artery, and a cuff of aorta is fashioned around the brachiocephalic arteries (Fig. 26-16, *A*). The left phrenic and left vagus nerves are identified and protected. A prepared polyester tube graft slightly smaller in diameter than the transected aorta is selected. Its length should be 5 to 8 cm (the length of the segment that will be positioned in the descending thoracic aorta) plus an amount sufficient for attachment to the aortic arch and to part or all of the ascending aorta. A stay suture is placed at the proximal (ascending aortic) end of the graft and secured with a clamp (Fig. 26-16, *B*). The proximal end of the graft is then inverted into the distal 5- to 8-cm segment that will be positioned in the descending thoracic aorta (see Fig. 26-16, *B*). The entire graft is inserted into the descending thoracic aorta (Fig. 26-16, *C*). The stay suture permits easy withdrawal of the inverted segment after anastomosis of the graft to the transected aorta is completed. If chronic dissection is present in the descending thoracic aorta, the septum between the true and false lumens is excised to permit full expansion of the segment of graft that will remain in the descending thoracic aorta. This segment of graft is kept relatively short to avoid compromising the lower intercostal arteries and development of paraplegia or paraparesis.

The aorta is sutured to the doubled-over edge of the aortic graft with a continuous 3-0 polypropylene suture. If the aorta is thin or dissected, this suture line can be reinforced with a strip of PTFE felt placed around the outside of the aorta (see Fig. 26-16, *C*). The invaginated portion of the graft is then

**Figure 26-16** Elephant trunk technique. **A,** After circulatory arrest is established, aorta is transected distal to left subclavian artery *(LSA)*, and origins of brachiocephalic arteries are separated from diseased aorta, along with a small cuff of aortic tissue. **B,** A stay suture is placed at proximal (ascending aortic) end of graft and secured with clamp. Proximal end of graft is inverted into distal 5- to 8-cm segment that will be positioned in descending thoracic aorta *(DTA)*.

withdrawn from the descending thoracic aorta by traction on the stay suture (Fig. 26-16, *D*). The procedure is then completed as just described under "Total Arch Replacement." It is essential that aortic flow be reestablished in the antegrade direction following the interval of circulatory arrest to avoid malperfusion of the brachiocephalic and coronary arteries. This can result from resumption of retrograde aortic flow from the femoral artery cannula and compression of the elephant trunk. For this reason, an aortic cannula is inserted into the aortic graft beneath the anastomosis to the brachiocephalic arteries and connected to the arterial line of the pump-oxygenator. Alternatively, an 8- or 10-mm prepared graft can be sutured to the aortic graft and connected to the arterial line.S24 Use of the right axillary artery for arterial return obviates the need for these maneuvers.

#### *Arch First Technique*

In some situations, a staged procedure may not be feasible or safe. Extensive thoracic aortic disease, particularly when there is marked (>4.5 cm) dilatation of the aorta just distal

**C,** Entire graft is positioned into DTA, and aorta is sutured to doubled-over edge of aortic graft with continuous 3-0 polypropylene suture incorporating a strip of polytetrafluoroethylene felt. **D,** Invaginated portion of graft is then withdrawn from DTA by traction on stay suture. Procedure is completed as shown in Fig. 26-15, *B* through *D*. It is necessary, however, to reestablish aortic flow in antegrade direction to avoid compression of the elephant trunk and malperfusion of brachiocephalic and coronary arteries (see text). Key: *BR*, Brachiocephalic artery; *LCA,* left carotid artery. **Figure 26-16, cont'd**

to the origin of the left subclavian artery, may preclude safe attachment of an elephant trunk graft to the aorta at this site. An extended period of circulatory arrest may be required to perform anastomosis of the graft to the descending thoracic aorta and then to the brachiocephalic arteries, which increases risk of brain injury. If anastomosis of the graft to the descending thoracic aorta must be performed more than 3 to 4 cm distal to the left subclavian artery, exposure through a median sternotomy may be suboptimal. In these circumstances, use of a bilateral anterior thoracotomy through the fourth intercostal space, combined with anastomosis of the graft to the brachiocephalic arteries first, facilitates exposure and minimizes duration of circulatory arrest. This approach also permits satisfactory exposure of the aortic root and provides access to the mitral valve and coronary arteries.C21,M16,R7 It may be of particular value in patients with chronic type A aortic dissection who require reoperation.K21,K22

After inserting the appropriate monitoring devices and cannulae for vascular access and a double-lumen endotracheal tube, the patient is placed in the supine position with the left hemithorax rotated 20 to 30 degrees to the right. The right arm is secured around the head, and the left arm is positioned over the head (Fig. 26-17, *A [inset]*). Bilateral submammary anterior thoracotomy incisions are made in the fourth intercostal space, with the left incision extending laterally to the midaxillary line and the right to the anterior axillary line. The left lung is collapsed. Both internal thoracic vascular pedicles are ligated and divided, and the sternum is divided transversely. The pericardium is incised over the aorta and over the right atrium, but only enough to permit separate cannulation of the superior and inferior venae cavae, insertion of a venting catheter through the right superior pulmonary vein, and placement of a cannula in the coronary sinus for delivery of cardioplegic solution (see Fig. 26-17, *A*). A tape is placed around the superior vena cava. Arterial return is established through a common femoral artery or the right axillary artery.

CPB is established, and cooling is initiated. Exposure of the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending thoracic aorta is obtained. Left phrenic and left vagus nerves are identified and protected (Fig. 26-17, *B*). The left inferior pulmonary ligament is divided. When the heart fibrillates, the ascending aorta is clamped. If there is no aortic regurgitation, cardioplegic solution is administered through a needle into the aortic root at 12- to 15-minute intervals. If clamping of the aorta is not possible, retrograde cardioplegia is used; it is administered as soon as the ascending aorta is opened after circulatory arrest has been established, and every 12 to 15 minutes thereafter. This may be supplemented by direct perfusion of the coronary arteries. When coronary artery bypass grafting is required, distal anastomoses are performed during cooling. Aortic valve or aortic root replacement or reconstruction can be performed at this time, if indicated. Circulatory arrest is established when the appropriate temperatures are reached and the electroencephalogram becomes isoelectric (see "Aortic Arch Replacement"). The patient's head is packed in ice and placed in a dependent position. The tape around the superior vena cava is secured, the superior vena caval cannula is clamped to distend the veins of the upper body and avoid suctioning of air into the opened aorta, and 20% to 25% of the calculated blood volume of the patient is drained from the inferior vena caval cannula into the venous reservoir of the bypass circuit. A clamp is placed on the distal descending thoracic aorta to minimize blood loss into the operative field when the aorta is opened and to permit perfusion of the lower body and lower intercostal arteries.

The ascending aorta is incised and transected proximally. Origins of the brachiocephalic arteries are separated from the aneurysm with a small cuff of aortic tissue. The descending aorta is incised distal to the arch (see Fig. 26-17, *B*). A prepared tube graft to which a 10-mm limb is attached is passed into the opened arch beneath the pedicle containing the left phrenic and vagus nerves, and into the opened descending aorta (Fig. 26-17, *C*). The 10-mm graft is positioned opposite the site where anastomosis of the aortic graft to the brachiocephalic arteries will be performed. An opening is made in the aortic graft with a wire cautery at the site of the arch vessels, and the cuff of aorta surrounding them is sutured to the graft (see Fig. 26-17, *C*). All aortic anastomoses are constructed with a continuous 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture buttressed with a strip of PTFE felt.

As anastomosis to the arch vessels is being completed, cold (18°C-20°C) oxygenated blood is infused into the superior vena caval cannula to evacuate air and atheromatous debris (see "Partial Arch Replacement"). The aortic graft is clamped just distal to the arch anastomosis with a long, straight atraumatic vascular clamp, and the proximal portion of the graft is allowed to fill with blood. A second arterial line from the pump-oxygenator is attached to the 10-mm graft, and flow is initiated to evacuate air from the proximal segment of the graft. If the axillary artery was used for arterial return, flow is initiated through this vessel rather than the 10-mm graft. Retrograde perfusion through the superior vena caval cannula is discontinued, and the aortic graft is clamped proximal to the aortic arch with a large straight or angled vascular clamp. Antegrade perfusion into the brachiocephalic arteries is then established at a flow of 800 to 1200 mL · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at a temperature of 20°C (Fig. 26-17, *D*).

An alternative technique involves use of a branched graft and separate suture of the three brachiocephalic arteries to branches of the graft (see Fig. 26-15, *B [inset]*). Right axillary artery perfusion is used, and after establishing circulatory arrest, the three arteries are transected at their origins from the aorta. They are flushed by a brief period of perfusion from the axillary artery to evacuate air and are occluded separately with clamps. Flow to the brain is established through the axillary artery (10-15 mL · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) at a temperature of 20°C to 22°C. The brachiocephalic arteries are then sequentially attached to the branches of the aortic graft, beginning with the left subclavian artery. When these anastomoses are completed, the aortic graft is clamped just distal to the left subclavian branch, the clamps on the brachiocephalic arteries are released, and after evacuation of air from the aortic graft, it is clamped just proximal to the brachiocephalic artery. Flow to the brain is then established in the antegrade direction through the three brachiocephalic arteries.

During hypothermic low flow to the upper body with either of the techniques described in the previous text, the distal clamp on the descending aorta is removed and the aorta is transected at the appropriate level (see Fig. 26-17, *D*). The aorta is beveled whenever possible to preserve the origins of the intercostal arteries below the sixth intercostal space. In the presence of chronic dissection, a large segment of the septum between the true and false lumens is removed to permit perfusion of both. The graft is cut to the appropriate length and sutured to the distal aorta (see Fig. 26-17, *D* and *E*). As this anastomosis is being completed, perfusion through the femoral arterial line (if present) is initiated to remove air and debris. After the anastomosis is completed, air is removed from the graft through several puncture holes created by an 18-gauge needle. The clamp on the aortic graft distal to the left subclavian artery is released, flow from the femoral arterial line is discontinued, and antegrade flow is established through the 10-mm graft or the axillary artery (see Fig. 26-17, *E*). Rewarming is begun at this time. The excluded, patent upper intercostal and bronchial arteries are ligated.

Clamp on distal descending aorta is removed, and open anastomosis of graft to distal descending aorta is performed. **Figure 26-17, cont'd**

The proximal end of the aortic graft is sutured to the ascending aorta or to an existing ascending aortic graft (see Fig. 26-17, *E*). Aortic valve or aortic root replacement, if indicated, can be completed during this time. If saphenous vein bypass grafts were placed, they are anastomosed to the aortic graft. The remaining clamp on the aortic graft is removed, and a needle vent is placed in the proximal portion of the graft and connected to suction. Procedures for reperfusion of the myocardium and evacuation of air are identical to those described under "Replacement of the Ascending

Aorta." CPB is discontinued, and the cannulae are removed (Fig. 26-17, *F*). Two intercostal drainage tubes are placed in each pleural space, and after achieving hemostasis, the incision is closed.

## Descending Thoracic Aorta Replacement

After standard preparations are completed, the patient is placed in the right lateral decubitus position with the left hip rotated posteriorly so that the left femoral artery and vein are accessible for cannulation. A left posterolateral thoracotomy incision is made, and the pleural space is entered through the top of the bed of the nonresected fifth or sixth rib (Fig. 26-18, *A*). If the aortic disease is limited to the upper portion of the descending thoracic aorta, the chest is entered through the top of the nonresected fifth rib. If the entire descending thoracic aorta is involved, a longer incision is made, curving slightly inferiorly at the anterior portion, and the pleural space is entered through the top of the nonresected sixth rib. Exposure can be enhanced by dividing the sixth rib or the fifth rib posteriorly. If the distal clamp must be placed at or near the diaphragm, a second entrance into the pleural space can be made through the top of the bed of the nonresected eighth rib. Alternatively, the costal margin can be divided. This will substantially enlarge the single opening into the chest, exposing the entire descending thoracic aorta.

The procedure varies according to location and extent of aortic disease. A limited dissection is performed around the aorta just proximal and distal to the diseased segment to permit placement of clamps. If the aortic disease begins at or

near the origin of the left subclavian artery, mobilizing the aortic arch between origins of the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries is required. The parietal pleura is incised between the left phrenic and left vagus nerves, and the aorta is isolated circumferentially. The left vagus and left recurrent laryngeal nerves are identified and protected. Access to the more proximal aorta can be improved by opening the pericardium, particularly if an aortic cannula is to be inserted proximal to the clamp site. Appropriate clamps are selected. The segment of aorta that is replaced should be no longer than necessary to avoid sacrificing patent intercostal arteries.

A suitable technique for protecting the spinal cord during aortic clamping is selected and implemented (see "Paraplegia after Aortic Clamping" under Special Situations and Controversies in Chapter 24). A prepared polyester tube graft of the proper size is chosen. The proximal aortic clamp and, when necessary, a left subclavian arterial clamp are placed (Fig. 26-18, *B*). When distal aortic perfusion is used, the distal aortic clamp is initially placed as close as possible to the

proximal clamp to permit perfusion of as many of the intercostal arteries as possible. The aorta is opened between the clamps and is transected proximally (Fig. 26-18, *C*). The patent intercostal and bronchial arteries in the aortic segment that will be excluded are ligated (Fig. 26-18, *D*). The graft is sutured to the proximal aorta with a continuous 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture buttressed with a strip of PTFE felt. If the left subclavian artery has been occluded, the proximal aortic clamp is repositioned onto the aortic graft to permit early perfusion of the left subclavian artery (Fig. 26-18, *E*). After this anastomosis is completed, the distal clamp can be repositioned at a lower level if necessary, and the aorta opened longitudinally. Location and patency of intercostal arteries, particularly those below the sixth or seventh intercostal space, are determined. The distal aorta is transected obliquely whenever possible, to permit preservation of the lower patent intercostal arteries. The aortic graft is beveled appropriately and sutured to the aorta. If an oblique incision is not possible, the lower intercostal arteries are detached from the aorta with a small, full-thickness cuff of adjacent aorta using the electrocautery (Fig. 26-18, *F*). The aortic graft is stretched, and a segment opposite the intercostal artery pedicle is excised with a wire cautery. The aortic cuff is sutured to the graft with a continuous 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture. The graft is flushed to remove air by removing the proximal clamp. This clamp is then repositioned below the pedicle to permit perfusion of the intercostal arteries (Fig. 26-18, *G*). The distal aorta is transected at the appropriate level, and the graft is sutured to the aorta with a continuous 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture buttressed with a strip of PTFE felt. If distal perfusion is used, the distal aortic clamp is briefly removed to assist in evacuating air from the graft and to assess integrity of the anastomosis. Distal flow is then discontinued.

If partial or total CPB is used, it is discontinued, protamine is administered, and the central and peripheral cannulae are removed. Two intercostal drainage catheters are placed, one posteriorly and inferiorly and one anteriorly at the apex of the pleural cavity. The incision is closed.

If the location and severity of aortic disease are such that clamps cannot be safely placed on the aorta, particularly in the area of the distal aortic arch, the procedure is performed using hypothermic CPB and circulatory arrest without placing clamps on the proximal aortaB19,C39,K23,K27,K32 (see "Technique Using Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest" in later text).

#### Thoracoabdominal Aorta Replacement

After standard preparations are completed, the patient is positioned in the right lateral decubitus position. The shoulders are positioned almost perpendicular to the operating table. The hips are rotated posteriorly at about 45 degrees from the table (Fig. 26-19, *A*). A thoracoabdominal incision is made, usually through the fifth or sixth intercostal space, entering the pleural cavity through the top of the bed of the lower rib. After dividing the costal margin, the incision is extended obliquely across the abdominal wall, and the muscles are divided to the level of the rectus abdominis fascia. The diaphragm is incised radially to the level of the aortic hiatus or circumferentially 2 to 3 cm from the chest wall. In some cases, it is possible to enlarge the aortic hiatus circumferentially and obtain sufficient exposure of the upper abdominal aorta so that division of the diaphragm is not necessary. The peritoneum is incised in the left gutter, and stomach, intestines, spleen, and left kidney are retracted anteriorly and to the right.C41

Because of the prevalence and clinical importance of paralysis of the lower extremities (paraplegia or paraparesis) following operations on the thoracoabdominal aorta, distal perfusion with some degree of systemic hypothermia (passive or induced), or regional hypothermia of the spinal cord induced by irrigation of the epidural space, is employed. Drainage of cerebrospinal fluid is also used (see "Paraplegia after Aortic Clamping" in Chapter 24).

#### *Technique Using Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest*

For purposes of illustration, the technique for thoracoabdominal aorta replacement using hypothermic CPB and circulatory arrest for protection of the spinal cord and the abdominal organs is shown in Fig. 26-19. The left common femoral artery and vein are exposed through an oblique or vertical incision in the groin crease. Heparin is administered, and a long 28F, 30F, or 32F cannula is inserted into the femoral vein over a guidewire system and positioned in the center of the right atrium. TEE is used to facilitate proper placement. With cannulae of these sizes and use of vacuumassisted venous drainage, flows of 2.0 to 2.4 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> can be easily achieved. If flow is limited, the pericardium is incised anterior and parallel to the left phenic nerve and a second 28F or 30F angled cannula is inserted into the pulmonary trunk through a purse-string suture. The tip of the cannula is passed retrogradely through the pulmonary valve and positioned in the right ventricle. Unless there is severe arteriosclerosis of the common femoral or external iliac artery, or if an abdominal aortic aneurysm is present, the femoral artery is cannulated with a 20F or 22F cannula. If this is not possible, the descending thoracic aorta, left subclavian artery, or left axillary artery can be used.B10,M19

CPB is established immediately after the chest is entered, and perfusion cooling is initiated. Methylprednisolone (7 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) and thiopental (10-15 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) are administered to protect the central nervous system. No other adjuncts for spinal cord protection are used. During cooling, the abdominal portion of the incision is completed. The left lung is collapsed and gently retracted to minimize manipulation and injury. The left vagus and left recurrent laryngeal nerves are identified and protected. When the heart fibrillates, a venting catheter is inserted into the left inferior pulmonary vein for decompression (Fig. 26-19, *B*). If the vein is not accessible, the catheter is placed into the left ventricle through a stab wound near the apex. The aorta proximal to the diseased segment is not clamped, and no form of cardioplegia is used.

Preparations for circulatory arrest are made as described under "Aortic Arch Replacement." Circulatory arrest is established after the patient is placed in Trendelenburg position and the venting catheter in the left heart has been occluded to prevent suction of air into the heart and proximal aorta. No clamps are placed on the proximal aorta. The aorta distal to the diseased segment is clamped. If a clamp cannot be safely placed on the distal aorta, it is opened and occluded with a balloon catheter. This is done to permit later perfusion of the iliac and hypogastric arteries, which may be important sources of blood flow to the lower spinal cord. The aorta is opened and transected proximal to the diseased segment (see Fig. 26-19, *B*). A prepared tube graft is selected and sutured to the proximal aorta with a continuous 3-0 or 4-0

**Figure 26-19** Thoracoabdominal aorta replacement. **A,** Patient is positioned in right lateral decubitus position. Shoulders are positioned perpendicular to operating table, and hips rotated posteriorly to 45-degree angle. Left pleural space is entered through fifth or sixth intercostal space. Incision is extended obliquely across costal margin toward umbilicus *(dashed line).* Oblique muscles of abdomen are divided to level of rectus fascia, and peritoneal cavity is entered. Diaphragm is divided, peritoneum in left gutter is incised vertically, and abdominal viscera and left kidney are retracted anteriorly and to the right (see text). **B,** Technique employing hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass and circulatory arrest. (See text for details.) Left femoral artery and vein *(LFA, LFV)* are cannulated, and a venting catheter is placed in left inferior pulmonary vein. After circulatory arrest is established, clamp is placed on lower thoracic aorta (if possible) to minimize blood loss. No clamps are placed on aorta proximal to diseased segment. Aorta is opened and transected proximally.

polypropylene suture buttressed with a strip of PTFE felt (Fig. 26-19, *C*). When this anastomosis is completed, an aortic perfusion cannula or a 10-mm prepared polyester graft that has been attached to the aortic graft is connected to a second arterial line from the pump-oxygenator adjacent to the anastomosis. With the patient's head in a dependent position, cold oxygenated (18°C-20°C) blood is infused retrogradely through the venous line until all air is evacuated from the brachiocephalic arteries and aortic arch. The aortic graft is clamped just distal to the proximal arterial line and flow into the upper and lower aorta (through the femoral artery) is established (Fig. 26-19, *D*). If the time of circulatory arrest is short (<20-25 minutes), it can be extended briefly so that the aorta can be widely opened to clearly identify patent lower intercostal and lumbar arteries and the origins of the visceral and renal arteries.

After flow through the upper and lower circuits has been established, 35% of the total arterial flow is directed through

**C,** Aortic graft, to which a 10-mm prepared polyester graft is attached, is sutured to aorta with continuous 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture buttressed with a strip of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) felt. Patent bronchial and intercostal arteries above sixth intercostal space are ligated. **D,** After evacuating air from circulation of upper body (see text), clamp is placed on graft just distal to the 10-mm graft, and flow into upper aorta is established. Lower aortic clamp is repositioned below segment of aorta to be resected, and flow into femoral arterial cannula is initiated. **Figure 26-19, cont'd** *Continued*

the upper arterial line and 65% through the lower line. The temperature of the perfusate is adjusted to maintain the nasopharyngeal temperature between 18°C and 20°C, and total flow is maintained between 750 and 1500 mL · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> . Drainage through the left heart vent is reestablished. During the period of hypothermic low flow, the intercostal and lumbar arteries that will be attached to the graft are isolated within a full-thickness cuff or cuffs of aorta that are excised from the diseased aortic segment with a cautery (Fig. 26-19, *E*). All patent intercostal and lumbar arteries below the sixth intercostal space should be attached to the graft if possible. A segment of graft opposite these arteries is excised with a wire cautery, and the rim of aortic tissue surrounding the arteries is sutured to the graft with a continuous 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture (see Fig. 26-19, *E* and *F*). The aortic clamp is repositioned below the intercostal artery–to-graft anastomoses, air is evacuated from the graft with a needle vent, and flow to the intercostal arteries is established (see Fig. 26-19, *F*). Rewarming is begun at this time, and flow is gradually increased to the precooling level.

Anastomoses to the visceral and renal arteries are then completed. This can be accomplished using a cuff of aorta (see Fig. 26-19, *F*) or by suturing the arteries individually to the graft. Interposition of segments of polyester grafts between the aortic graft and these arteries may be necessary, particularly in patients with Marfan syndrome.K20,K32 When these anastomoses are completed, the aortic clamp is repositioned below the level of the renal arteries, and anastomosis to the distal aorta is completed (Fig. 26-19, *G*).

![](_page_33_Picture_2.jpeg)

**E,** With hypothermic low flow established above and below isolated aortic segment, intercostal and lumbar arteries that will be attached to graft are isolated with full-thickness cuff of aorta. This cuff is sutured to graft with continuous 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture. **F,** Clamp on graft is repositioned below intercostal pedicle to permit perfusing intercostal arteries. Full-thickness cuff of aortic tissue surrounding celiac, superior mesenteric, and renal arteries is excised from aorta with a cautery, and cuff is sutured to graft with continuous 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture. **G,** Clamp on graft is repositioned on aorta below renal arteries, and graft is sutured to distal aorta with 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture buttressed with a strip of PTFE felt. **Figure 26-19, cont'd**

During cooling, the heart spontaneously fibrillates and becomes quiescent; during rewarming, spontaneous defibrillation occurs in most patients when the nasopharyngeal temperature reaches 26°C to 28°C. The venting catheter is then removed. CPB is discontinued when the bladder temperature reaches 36°C. Peripheral cannulae are removed, protamine is administered, and hemostasis is obtained. A drain connected to suction is placed in the retroperitoneal space, and intercostal drainage catheters (two or three) are placed in the left pleural space. Edges of the divided diaphragm are approximated, and the incision is closed.

# *Technique Using Left Heart Bypass*

A widely used alternative technique is left heart bypass (left atrium to left femoral artery) and mild (32°C-33°C) permissive hypothermia.C33,S4,S11,S28 The common femoral artery and the left atrium (or alternatively, the left inferior or superior pulmonary vein) are cannulated and partial cardiac bypass established using an in-line centrifugal pump. Bypass flows are adjusted to maintain a mean arterial pressure in the lower circulation of 60 to 70 mmHg while normal arterial pressure and central venous pressure are maintained in the upper circulation. Flows between 750 and 1500 mL · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> are generally required. The aorta is clamped proximal to the diseased aortic segment, and a second clamp is placed on the descending aorta in the midportion. This maneuver maintains perfusion of the lower intercostal arteries, kidneys, abdominal organs, and lower extremities. As the operation proceeds, the distal aortic clamp is sequentially moved to lower positions to maintain distal perfusion. If distal clamping is not possible, separate balloon-tipped perfusion catheters can be introduced into the celiac, superior mesenteric, and renal arteries and connected to a cannula from the perfusion circuit to provide oxygenated blood to these organs. The procedure is then completed as shown in Fig. 26-19, *E* through *G*.

# SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Patients who have undergone thoracic or thoracoabdominal aorta replacement receive the same care given to patients after major cardiac operations (see Chapter 5). Particular attention is paid to maintaining adequate ventricular preload by volume infusions. Amount of chest drainage is closely monitored, and the usual rules for reentry (see "Treatment of Bleeding" in Chapter 5) are observed because major bleeding can occur, and it is a risk factor for developing other complications.

When the procedure has been performed through a left thoracotomy or thoracoabdominal incision, pulmonary complications are more likely to develop than after a median sternotomy. Thus, close attention to pulmonary subsystem management is mandatory (see Chapter 5 for details). Because renal blood flow is often reduced or absent for a time during and early after repair, renal function must also be carefully monitored early postoperatively. Managing renal dysfunction and renal failure is discussed in Chapter 5.

Although most patients in whom paraplegia or paraparesis develops after operations on the descending thoracic or thoracoabdominal aorta have evidence of ischemic injury upon awakening from anesthesia, this complication sometimes develops later postoperatively.C46 Prompt initiation of cerebrospinal fluid drainage may, in some instances, reverse the neurologic deficit, and if a drain is not already in place, it should be inserted when signs of spinal cord ischemia develop postoperatively.H8,S5 Avoiding prolonged periods of hypotension is also essential to ensure optimal spinal cord perfusion.

Because additional aortic disease frequently develops in patients who have had operations on the thoracic aorta, periodic evaluation is an important feature of their postoperative care. This should be performed at 4- to 6-month intervals in the first postoperative year, and semiannually or annually thereafter. Two-dimensional echocardiography is useful for examining the aortic root and proximal ascending aorta. CT or MRI is required to accurately assess the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. Ultrasonography can be used to evaluate the abdominal aorta.

## RESULTS

Survival

*Early (Hospital) Death*

**Ascending Aorta** Early (hospital) mortality after elective repair of chronic ascending aortic disease in heterogeneous groups of patients ranges from 0% to 9%.A2,C1,C18,E10,F4,G7,G8,H2,K26,K28,L9,L15,O6,R1,S8,S26,T4 Most patients in these series had aneurysms of the ascending aorta resulting from cystic medial degenerative disease and had concomitant aortic valve replacement, either as a separate procedure or using a composite graft. These series also included patients with Marfan syndrome and patients who had partial resection of the aortic arch with hypothermic circulatory arrest. Use of hypothermic circulatory arrest is not a risk factor for increased mortality among such patients.K34 Resection of the ascending aorta for severe diffuse arteriosclerosis or calcification, usually performed in conjunction with coronary artery bypass grafting or aortic valve replacement, is associated with higher early mortality and morbidity.G2,K9,R5,R6,T2,Z2 These procedures usually require hypothermic circulatory arrest. Endarterectomy is preferred by some groups for managing the severely calcified ascending aorta and has similar early mortality.G2,K29,S30

**Aortic Arch** Early mortality after elective repair of aortic disease that involves the arch is higher, ranging from 5% to about 20%.B1,B12,E9,K7,O3,S2,S16,S22,S27 This is related in part to greater complexity of the operative procedures compared with operations on the ascending aorta, and to higher prevalence of neurologic injury, which is associated with increased mortality. In general, resection of the entire or distal aortic arch is associated with higher mortality than operations involving only the proximal aortic archS22,S27 (Table 26-1).

**Descending Thoracic Aorta** When aortic disease is confined to the descending thoracic aorta, early mortality for elective procedures with currently used techniques is 4% to  $10\%^{B18,C36,K32,S10,S27,S29,V2}$  (Table 26-2).

**Thoracoabdominal Aorta** With increasing experience, and with use of adjuncts such as distal aortic perfusion and hypothermia, early mortality for elective operations is approximately 3% to 15%<sup>C3,C9,C28,C35,D20,F2,H12,J1,K33,O4,O6,S6,S11,S21,S27</sup> (Tables 26-3 and 26-4).

In all the mentioned categories, emergency operation for rupture or acute dissection is associated with substantially higher early mortality.

#### Time-Related Survival

**Ascending Aorta** Among heterogeneous groups of patients, survival after ascending aorta replacement, usually in combination with aortic valve replacement, is approximately 70% at 5 years and 50% to 60% at 10 years<sup>G7,K28,L9,S8,S26</sup> (Fig. 26-20). In a collaborative study from 10 centers, excellent results were obtained for patients with Marfan syndrome. G8 Five-year survival for elective repair was 86%, and 10-year survival was 80% (Fig. 26-21). Survival was lower for patients who required urgent or emergency operation.

**Aortic Arch** Among a heterogeneous group of 227 patients who underwent operations on the aortic arch by Coselli and colleagues, 5-year survival was 79%<sup>C29</sup> (Fig. 26-22). In a heterogeneous group of 220 patients who had replacement of the aortic arch with a branched graft and selective antegrade perfusion of the brachiocephalic arteries,

**Thoracoabdominal Aorta** In one of the largest series of patients with surgical repair of thoracoabdominal aortic disease (n=1509) reported by Svensson and colleagues in 1993, <sup>\$27</sup> survival was 60% at 5 years and 32% at 10 years (Fig. 26-27). In a series of 1220 patients treated more recently reported by Coselli and colleagues, <sup>C35</sup> survival was 74% at 5 years (Fig. 26-28). As noted previously with descending thoracic aortic aneurysms, survival among patients with degenerative thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms was substantially lower than for patients with nondegenerative aneurysms <sup>K33</sup> (Fig. 26-29).

#### Modes of Death

Myocardial failure and infarction, hemorrhage, neurologic dysfunction, and multiple system organ failure are common

modes of early death after operations on the thoracic aorta.  $^{\rm B1,B18,C18,E9,G8,H12,K7,K23,K26,K28,K32,K33,O3,S10}$ 

Most later deaths are related to myocardial failure, rupture of a new aneurysm or treatment of new aortic disease, and renal and respiratory failure. Occasionally, deaths late after operation are due to rupture of an anastomotic false aneurysm.

# Incremental Risk Factors for Premature Death after Repair

## Patient-Specific Risk Factors

Location of aneurysm on the aortic arch or thoracoabdominal aorta poses greater risks for early death than location on the ascending or descending thoracic aorta. Among patients with thoracoabdominal aortic disease, operations for extent II disease as defined by Crawford and colleagues (Fig. 26-30) are associated with increased risk compared with extent I or III<sup>C35,C42,F2,K23,K33</sup> (see Tables 26-3 and 26-4). These risks are related importantly to brain and spinal cord ischemic injuries, which occur more often after operations in these regions. Improved techniques of brain and spinal cord protection may ultimately neutralize these risks.

Older age and coexisting coronary arterial, renal, and pulmonary disease are associated with increased early and late death. C35,C49,K23,K28,O6,S27 Emergency operation for rupture of a thoraci or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm increases risk. C45,K23,K32,K33,L12,M6,V1

## Diagnostic and Procedural Risk Factors

Although improved outcomes in recent years can be attributed to changes in preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative management, the specific improvements that are responsible are difficult to quantify. They include a clearer understanding of the natural history of diseases of the thoracic aorta, improved diagnostic studies, increased knowledge of the determinants of operative risk, and critical analyses of early and long-term results. K18 Improved techniques for brain protection have reduced the risk of operations on the aortic arch. Increased use of distal perfusion and other adjuncts has substantially reduced spinal cord ischemic injury and death after operations on the descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta. Availability of prepared grafts that are impervious to blood and improved methods for minimizing intraoperative and postoperative blood loss have also contributed to the improved outcomes.

#### Institutional Risk Factors

In institutions properly prepared for complex aortic surgical procedures, risks of repair are lower than in other institutions.

## Complications

#### Brain Injury

Brain injury is an important complication of operations on the thoracic aorta, particularly those that involve the aortic arch. In a study of 183 patients following operations on the thoracic aorta in which hypothermic circulatory arrest was used, Ergin and colleagues identified two types of neurologic injury: (1) temporary neurologic dysfunction (agitation, lethargy, obtundation, disorientation, psychosis, choreoathetoid movements, and seizures) and (2) stroke. E9 Temporary neurologic dysfunction occurred in 19% of patients and was correlated with duration of circulatory arrest and older age. Stroke was attributed to embolism and occurred in 11% of patients. Strokes correlated with older age, operations on the aortic arch, and presence of descending thoracic

aneurysms that contained thrombus or atheroma. Improved methods of brain protection during operations on the aortic arch, including retrograde brain perfusion, avoidance of prolonged (>50-60 minutes) circulatory arrest, and antegrade cerebral perfusion are associated with lower occurrence of both temporary and permanent neurologic dysfunction.A2,B12,C29,H2,K7,K14,K19,K21-K23,K26,K34

#### *Spinal Cord Injury*

Paraplegia and paraparesis can occur after operations on the descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta. Because of its clinical importance, preventing spinal cord ischemic injury is paramount (see "Paraplegia after Aortic Clamping" under Special Situations and Controversies in Chapter 24). Although considerable experience has been reported with the technique of simple aortic clamping, principally by Crawford and colleagues, there is emerging consensus that distal perfusion with some degree of systemic hypothermia (passive or induced), or regional hypothermia of the spinal cord induced by irrigation of the epidural space, reduces occurrence of spinal cord ischemic injury.C3,C42,C50,S4,S11,S27,S29 Drainage of cerebrospinal fluid has also been associated with reduced occurrence of spinal cord ischemic injury.C34,E13,S4

### *Renal Dysfunction and Failure*

Renal dysfunction can occur following operations on the descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta. Because of variability of the criteria that are used to define it, the true prevalence is difficult to determine. Postoperative renal failure managed with dialysis occurs in 1% to 5% of patients having operations on the descending thoracic aorta and in 5% to 15% of those requiring replacement of the thoracoabdominal aorta.C5,C9,C28,C35,C36,K32,K33,M5,S3 Preoperative renal dysfunction, as evidenced by elevated creatinine, is a predictor of postoperative renal failure when simple aortic clamping or normothermic distal perfusion is used for operations on the thoracoabdominal aorta.K3,S3

#### *Pulmonary Dysfunction*

Pulmonary dysfunction of sufficient severity to require prolonged (>48-72 hours) mechanical ventilatory support occurs in 20% to 30% of patients undergoing repair of thoracic and thoracoabdominal aneurysms in which a lateral incision is used.C3,C36,C39,H12,K23,K33,M5,S27 Occurrence of this complication appears to be independent of operative technique (simple aortic clamping, distal perfusion, hypothermic circulatory arrest, epidural cooling). Incremental risk factors for prolonged ventilatory support after operations on the thoracoabdominal aorta include older age, division of the diaphragm, duration of aortic clamping, number of packed red blood cell units transfused, and current smoking.E7

#### *Reoperation*

Late reoperation is necessary in a substantial number of patients, particularly when there has been a previous aortic dissection or when Marfan syndrome is present. Thus, as in the case of acute aortic dissection (see Chapter 25), periodic evaluation with aortic imaging of patients following operations on the thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta is essential.

## INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

#### Ascending Aorta

Patients with symptoms attributable to chronic aneurysm of the ascending aorta should, in general, have prompt surgical treatment whether the symptoms are from enlargement of the aneurysm or from aortic valve regurgitation. Patients with cystic medial degenerative disease should undergo elective replacement of the ascending aorta and the aortic sinuses when the greatest diameter of the aorta exceeds 5.0 to 5.5 cm.D5,G8,H9,K18,K28 If substantial aortic valve regurgitation is present, operation may be advisable before the aorta reaches this diameter. Surgical repair of the dilated aortic root or ascending aorta in patients with Marfan syndrome is usually performed at a threshold of 5.0 cm because of the greater tendency for aortic dissection at a smaller diameter.H9 Rapid growth of the aneurysm (>0.5 cm · year <sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), family history of aortic dissection, and presence of moderate to severe aortic regurgitation are indications for operation at a smaller diameter. For patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome or a confirmed TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 gene mutation, repair should be considered at a diameter of 4.4 to 4.6 cm as determined by CT or MRI.H9

Asymptomatic patients with degenerative thoracic aneurysm, chronic aortic dissection, intramural hematoma, penetrating arteriosclerotic ulcer, and mycotic or false aneurysm with an aortic diameter of 5.5 cm or greater should be considered for surgical repair.H9 Growth of 0.5 cm · year <sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in aortas of smaller diameter is also an indication for repair. Patients who have dilatation of the ascending aorta in association with a congenitally bicuspid aortic valve and who require aortic valve replacement should have concomitant replacement of the ascending aorta when it measures more than 4.5 cm. These recommendations are based on evidence that combined operative and late mortality is less than mortality observed in patients managed without operation.H9,M12

## Aortic Arch

Patients who are symptomatic from chronic aneurysms that involve the aortic arch should, in most instances, undergo prompt surgical treatment, because the natural history of this condition is particularly unfavorable. Because of the complexity of operations that require replacement of the aortic arch and because neurologic complications are not uncommon (see "Brain Injury"), elective operation is generally advised only for aneurysms that are 5.5 to 6.0 cm in diameter or when there is documented progressive enlargement.H9 Aneurysms of the aortic arch are often associated with aneurysmal disease of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta, and this may be the principal indication for operation.

Arteriosclerotic disease involves the aortic arch more frequently than other parts of the thoracic aorta. Because the presence of arteriosclerotic plaques with a thickness of more than 4 mm is an important predictor of brain infarction and because such plaques are also a source of embolization to other organs, graft replacement or endarterectomy of the involved segment of the arch should be considered when severe disease is detected in patients who are undergoing operations on the heart or ascending aorta.G2,K1,K4,K8,K26,K29,L15,R6,T7 Occasionally, presence of pedunculated mobile atheroma in patients who have had a transient ischemic attack or stroke is an indication for operation.L7,M23,R8,S32

# Descending Thoracic and Thoracoabdominal Aorta

Patients with symptoms attributable to chronic aneurysms that involve the descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta should, in general, have prompt operation, because rupture before operation substantially increases risk of the procedure (see "Incremental Risk Factors for Premature Death after Repair" under Results). The appearance of even mild symptoms, particularly in patients with thoracoabdominal aneurysms, may represent progression into a subacute phase that is associated with increased risk of rupture and higher operative mortality.C35

Advising surgical treatment for asymptomatic patients with chronic descending or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms is less straightforward because of risks of stroke, spinal cord ischemic injury, renal failure, and a high prevalence of pulmonary complications postoperatively (see "Complications" under Results). Careful assessment of preoperative risk factors for death and for postoperative paralysis is essential before a recommendation for surgical intervention is made. These risk factors must be weighed against the probability of rupture of the aneurysm. In good-risk patients at experienced surgical centers, elective resection is advisable when the aneurysm exceeds 5.5 cm in the descending thoracic aorta and 6.0 cm in the thoracoabdominal aorta or when there is documented progressive enlargement.H9 All asymptomatic patients in whom surgical treatment is deferred must have periodic follow-up, with determination of the size and extent of the aneurysm or other aortic disease by CT or MRI every 6 to 12 months, depending on the size of the aorta. In general, increase in size during the period of observation is a strong indication for surgical intervention.

#### Other Conditions

There is evidence from natural history studies to suggest that patients with chronic aneurysms resulting from type B aortic dissections are more likely to die of rupture of the aneurysm than patients with aneurysms not associated with dissection.G13,J7 In the study by Griepp and colleagues, patients with rupture of chronically dissected aortas had significantly smaller maximal descending thoracic aortic diameters than patients with rupture of degenerative aneurysms.G13 These observations indicate that a more aggressive surgical approach is indicated in patients with aneurysms associated with chronic type B dissection.

Patients with penetrating arteriosclerotic ulcers or intramural hematomas in whom symptoms and signs of impending rupture are present or in whom false aneurysms develop should undergo graft replacement of the involved segment of the aorta irrespective of size. Patients with severe arteriosclerosis and repeated episodes of embolization to the abdominal viscera, kidneys, or lower extremities should be considered for excision and graft replacement of the diseased aortic segment.K1,R8

# SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

## Endovascular Grafts

Techniques have been developed for placing intraluminal stent-grafts into the descending thoracic aorta and aortic arch to treat patients with aortic aneurysms, dissections, intramural hematomas, penetrating arteriosclerotic ulcers, false aneurysm, and acute traumatic aortic disruption (see Chapter 24).D2,E5,G9,N3,W7

## Descending Thoracic Aorta

Substantial experience has been accumulated with endovascular stent-grafts for aortic disease confined to the descending thoracic aorta. Availability of several commercially manufactured devices has facilitated implementation of this technology for a wide variety of conditions (Fig. 26-31).

Major requisites for graft placement are suitable landing zones proximal and distal to the diseased segment (1.5-2.0 cm in length), and diameters of these aortic segments greater than 20 mm and less than 40 mm. A4 Possible deployment sites of the proximal end of endovascular grafts<sup>C54</sup> are shown in Fig. 26-32. There is emerging consensus that if coverage of the origin of the left subclavian artery is required, a left subclavian artery-to-left carotid artery bypass graft or transposition should be performed before deployment of the graft when feasible. C26,M9,Z3 Absence of revascularization of the left subclavian artery in this setting has been associated with a higher prevalence of left arm ischemia, vertebrobasilar ischemia, spinal cord ischemia, and anterior circulation stroke.<sup>M9</sup> Drainage of cerebrospinal fluid, when extensive coverage of the descending thoracic aorta is planned or when abdominal aortic aneurysm repair has been previously performed, is also advisable to reduce prevalence of spinal cord ischemic injury. C13,M4

No randomized trials have compared endovascular treatment of descending thoracic aortic disease with open operation. Meta-analysis of large numbers of patients undergoing open or endovascular repair of isolated descending thoracic aortic disease has suggested lower (with endovascular repair) or comparable early (30-day or hospital) mortality. C12,C19,G5 Patients treated with endovascular stent-grafts were generally older. Prevalence of postoperative complications in the aggregate was lower among these patients as well, and length of hospital stay was shorter. C12,G5 In the study by Gopaldas and colleagues of patients in the United States, hospital charges

were substantially higher in the endovascular cohort, and the endovascular stent-graft patients were four times more likely to have a routine discharge to home. G5

There is no clear evidence from these and other studies demonstrating a substantial difference between the two methods of treatment in occurrence of postoperative stroke, spinal cord ischemic injury, or renal failure among patients with degenerative aneurysms or aortic dissection. Midterm survival of patients treated with the two techniques is comparable <sup>C19,G10,S19</sup> (Fig. 26-33). Survival for the subset of patients with ruptured aneurysms is also comparable. <sup>C19,P2</sup>

Complications unique to endovascular stent-grafting include endoleak, retrograde type A aortic dissection, aneurysm expansion and rupture, stent-graft collapse, graft migration, aortic valve perforation by a guidewire, dilatation of proximal and distal landing zones, injury to femoral and external iliac arteries, and erosion of the aorta resulting in aorto-bronchial or aortoesophageal fistulas. A4,C12,D19,F1,M1,O1,O2,P9,S29 Periodic surveillance imaging studies are mandatory and add to overall cost of the procedure. Durability of the currently available devices beyond 10 years is unknown.

Endovascular stent-grafting should be considered for elderly patients with important comorbidity and limited life expectancy if the risk of intervention is judged to be lower than that for nonoperative or open surgical management. The precise role of endovascular stent-grafting in younger patients at lower risk for open operation remains incompletely defined.

#### **Hybrid Operations**

Aortic Arch Hybrid procedures combining open surgical repair with endovascular grafting to treat aneurysmal disease involving the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta include the "stented" or "frozen" elephant trunk technique, <sup>K2</sup> and open debranching of the brachiocephalic arteries with repair of the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta using a stent-graft<sup>C57</sup> (Fig. 26-34, *A* and *B*). The stented elephant trunk procedure was developed to eliminate the second stage of the conventional elephant trunk procedure or other procedures on the remaining thoracic aorta. To date, this objective has not been realized. DIT, KI5, KI7, P8,T9 The debranching procedure has been applied primarily to patients deemed to be at high risk for conventional aortic arch repair. Early results do not

appear to be superior to those following conventional aortic arch replacement.A11,K30 Long-term results are not available.

**Thoracoabdominal Aorta** The hybrid procedure for repairing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm consists of an open operation in which the visceral and renal artery segment of the abdominal aorta is debranched with bypass grafts originating from the distal abdominal aorta or iliac arteries in order to provide a distal seal zone for subsequent placement of an endograftQ1 (Fig. 26-34, *C*). Accumulated experience indicates that these procedures are associated with substantial mortality and morbidity and should be performed only in highly selected patients.B9,C14,G11,M22,P3

# Brain Protection during Operations on the Aortic Arch

Early attempts to use temporary shunts to the brachiocephalic arteries during repair of aneurysms of the aortic arch are described under Historical Note in this chapter. By 1957, CPB was being used in some form for operations on the aortic arch, and this practice continues to this day. A small proportion of patients experience brain damage from CPB per se (see "Neurobehavioral and Neurologic Outcomes" under Results in Chapter 7, and see "Neuropsychological Subsystem" in Section I of Chapter 5) and from profound hypothermic circulatory arrest (see "Damaging Effects of Circulatory Arrest during Hypothermia" and "Safe Duration of Circulatory Arrest" in Section I of Chapter 2). However, prevalence of brain injury is greater after operations on the aortic arch than after other types of aortic or cardiac surgery. Brain injury is a frequent cause of death and complications after these operations and likely occurs as a result of embolization of particulate matter or severe global ischemia during the interval of circulatory arrest. Several methods are currently being used for protection of the brain during operations on the aortic arch.

## *Antegrade Brain Perfusion*

During operations on the aortic arch, more or less continuous antegrade brain perfusion is possible only when two or more of the brachiocephalic arteries are separately perfused after the aortic arch has been opened. This technique was the first to be used for operations on the aortic arch, but survival was relatively low.C25,D9 Frist and colleagues perfused only one brachiocephalic artery, usually the trunk, and cannulated it directly.F7 Results with normothermic or mildly hypothermic brain perfusion were disappointing.

Crittenden and colleagues documented in a sheep model the clear superiority of antegrade brain perfusion over alternative methods of brain protection.C55 They demonstrated that hypothermic, low-flow, antegrade brain perfusion preserved intracellular pH and energy stores. Bachet and colleagues and Kazui and colleagues have accumulated large series of patients in whom this technique has been used with satisfactory outcomes.B1,K7 Its advantage is that it allows an interval of safe, total body circulatory arrest because the brain is supplied with nutrients and oxygen during this period. The technique requires manipulation and direct cannulation of these arteries, with risk of dislodging arteriosclerotic debris and the potential for embolization of this material as well as air. In a study by Hagl and colleagues, this technique, compared with other techniques of brain protection, was associated with the lowest prevalence of temporary neurologic dysfunction.H1 However, it may not be fully protective in patients who require antegrade perfusion for more than 80 minutes.H1

Although direct antegrade perfusion of all three brachiocephalic arteries is considered optimal,K7 substantial experience has been accumulated with perfusion of the brain only through the brachiocephalic or right axillary artery.F7,H2,J3,K16,K19,T4,T6 This technique eliminates need for direct cannulation and perfusion of the brachiocephalic arteries. Although concern has been expressed about inadequate perfusion of the left brain,K5 particularly in the absence of a complete circle of Willis, this has not proved to be an important problem. Perfusion at low temperature (20°C-25°C) likely contributes to the safety of this technique.

#### *Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest*

The simplest and currently the most widely used technique for brain protection during operations on the aortic arch is hypothermic circulatory arrest using CPB for cooling and rewarming of the patient (see "Replacement of Aortic Arch" for a description). A major advantage of this technique is its simplicity. It provides an operative field essentially free of blood and cannulae, and permits thorough inspection of the inside of the aorta and performance of secure distal aortic and arch anastomoses.

In carefully conducted clinical studies, neurologic complications are occasionally observed following use of hypothermic circulatory arrest for operations on the aortic arch in adults.E9 In addition to strokes, which are likely embolic in origin, temporary neurologic dysfunction occurs in approximately 20% of patients. Prevalence of temporary neurologic dysfunction increases with increasing age and with duration of circulatory arrest.E3,E9 Scrupulous implementation of techniques to ensure adequate cooling and rewarming of the brain is essential to minimize occurrence of this complication.G12 Because deterioration of cognitive function postoperatively occurs more often in patients with more than 25 minutes of hypothermic circulatory arrest, its safe duration in adults may be closer to 30 minutes rather than 40 to 50 minutes, as previously reported.D15,G12,S27 Recent studies in animals and humans suggest that cerebral metabolic suppression at clinical levels of hypothermia is less complete than had been previously assumed.G12,M11 Use of adjuncts such as retrograde brain perfusion (see "Retrograde Brain Perfusion" in text that follows) may increase the safe duration of hypothermic circulatory arrest beyond this limit and may reduce the prevalence of embolic stroke.C29,J9,K14,K22,K23

If hypothermic circulatory arrest is used for procedures that require a left thoracotomy, presence of severe aortic regurgitation may be a relative contraindication to its use because distention of the left ventricle may occur when the heart fibrillates. This may result in impaired subendocardial perfusion and ischemia of the left ventricle. If substantial aortic regurgitation is known to be present preoperatively and the procedure to be performed on the aorta is elective, the aortic valve should be replaced, and the procedure on the aorta should be performed 3 to 6 weeks later. If aortic regurgitation is not detected until time of the operation, an alternative technique should be used.

#### *Retrograde Brain Perfusion*

Protection of the brain during operations on the aortic arch by perfusing cold oxygenated blood into the superior vena cava was first reported by Ueda and colleagues.U1,U2 This technique offers the potential advantages of delivering nutrients to the brain during an interval of hypothermic circulatory arrest and removing embolic material from the arterial circulation of the brain. Subsequent studies in animals have demonstrated that little or no effective blood flow occurs during retrograde perfusion, even with occlusion of the superior vena cava, to confer any meaningful metabolic benefit.B16,J8,Y2,Y3 Retrograde perfusion is, however, an effective method for washout of particulate emboli from the brain.J8 Thus, its principal role is as an adjunct rather than as a primary technique for brain protection during hypothermic circulatory arrest.E4,J9,K14

## False Aneurysms

False aneurysms are infrequent but serious complications after operations on the thoracic aorta and following infection or trauma. Their true prevalence after thoracic aortic procedures is unknown, but systematic surveillance suggests that false aneurysms may be present in up to 13% of patients after graft replacement of the ascending aorta for aneurysm or dissection.M13 They have been observed in up to 7% of patients following operations on the descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta and occur primarily at sites of attachment of intercostal, visceral, and renal arteries to the aortic grafts.K31 Infection of grafts, with or without associated mediastinitis, progressive degeneration of the aortic wall, aortic dissection, and use of biological glues have been implicated as etiologic factors.A13,C27,D21,K6,M2,V3 False aneurysms have also occurred at aortic suture lines, sites of aortic cannulation and clamping, and sites of attachment of coronary arteries with buttons of aortic tissue and coronary artery bypass grafts.A13,M2,V3

Surgical treatment includes direct repair, resection, and graft replacement of the sites of the false aneurysm with synthetic or biological grafts, patch repair, and endovascular stent-graft repair.A13,K31,M2,M13,V3 CPB is almost always necessary, and hypothermic circulatory arrest has been required in up to 60% of patients.M2,V3 In several large series, operative mortality did not exceed 10%, 5-year survival ranged from 74% to 79%, and freedom from reoperation at 5 years ranged from 72% to 77%.A13,M2,V3

## Infected Aneurysms

Because infected (mycotic) aneurysms may be multifocal, the entire aorta should be evaluated. Because of the high probability of rupture, surgical treatment should not be delayed in an attempt to control the infection with antibiotic therapy.C10 In a series of 22 patients reported by Chan and colleagues, rupture of the aneurysm occurred in 18% of patients who were treated without operation and in whom septic symptoms were never controlled.C10

Excision of the infected aortic segment is required to control sepsis and prevent rupture. The aorta can be replaced with an aortic allograft, autologous or heterologous pericardium, or a polyester graft. Aortic root allografts may be particularly advantageous for infections that involve the aortic root.T10 Encouraging results have been reported with these techniques, with early survival exceeding 85%.C10,P1 Lifetime oral antibiotic therapy is recommended to prevent recurrence of infection.B22,C10

# Infected Aortic Grafts

Graft infections occur in 1% to 2% of patients who have undergone replacement of the thoracic aorta.A7,C8,H3,S27 Infection may appear at any time, but peak occurrence appears to be in the first month after operation.C31 Important risk factors for infection include inadequate sterile technique, excessive transfusion of blood products, bacteremia, and reoperation.C31,K25 Grafts that are placed in the ascending aorta or aortic arch are particularly vulnerable because of the absence of muscle between the graft and the sternum and subcutaneous tissues.C31 In the experience with infected aortic grafts reported by Coselli and colleagues, 33% of patients had a wound infection or sternal dehiscence, 27% had previous cardiac procedures, 17% had a distant infection, and 10% had delayed closure of their sternal wounds.C31 Fifty-eight percent of the infectious organisms were gram-positive (primarily staphylococcal species), 23% were gram-negative, and 2% were fungal. No organisms were isolated in some patients despite local signs of infection.

Infection of prosthetic grafts is usually associated with signs and symptoms of systemic infection. CT scanning may demonstrate pockets of air or air-fluid levels adjacent to the graft. MRI with gallium- or indium-labeled leukocytes or with indium immunoglobulin scintigraphy may be helpful.C32 TEE may demonstrate false aneurysm formation. Diagnosis of graft infection is often based on a combination of bacteriologic and radiographic findings and a high index of suspicion.

Modern surgical principles for treating infected aortic grafts were described by Hargrove and Edmunds in 1984.H3 They include prompt reoperation and débridement of all infected tissue, removal of infected prosthetic material if suture lines are involved (this may not always be possible), local antiseptic irrigation and systemic antibiotics, and use of pedicle flaps of muscle or omentum to cover the grafts. Extraanatomic rerouting of arterial blood flow is not practical in most cases of thoracic aortic graft infection. Omentum is the pedicle graft of choice for treating an infected ascending aortic graft. It is pliable, fills dead space well, and usually provides ample coverage. In addition, it absorbs fluid, secretes angiogenic factors, and results in no loss of function compared with muscle flaps.M8

Several groups have reported success using these methods.B3,C31,C32,H3,L5,M15,V4 In a series of 40 patients reported by Coselli and colleagues, 70% were hospital survivors and were alive 4 months to 6.5 years postoperatively.C31 Patients received 6 to 8 weeks of intravenous antibiotics followed by lifelong oral antibiotic therapy.

## Ringed Intraluminal and Patch Grafts

Ringed sutureless intraluminal prostheses that are anchored to the aorta by tapes placed around them and tied tightly over rigid spools at each end of the graft have been successfully used to replace segments of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta.A1,B8,D23,L8,O9 Potential advantages of this technique compared with conventional suture anastomotic technique include reduced aortic clamp time and blood loss.B8 Erosion of the aortic wall at the site of the tapes, obstruction to flow from buckling or kinking of the prosthesis or from use of a small prosthesis, and hemolysis and anemia are complications of this technique that limit its usefulness.B8

Patch grafts rather than tube grafts can be used to treat saccular aneurysms located on the undersurface of the aortic arch and in the descending thoracic aorta when they have a small, discrete communication with the aortic lumen. However, the adjacent aorta is often abnormal and unsuitable for safe placement of sutures. This technique should be used only when the adjacent aorta is normal in appearance and thickness.
