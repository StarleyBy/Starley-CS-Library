## DEFINITION

Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is a means of imparting energy for forward flow of blood in the body by manmade devices. Its intent is to remove some or all work of cardiac output from either or both left and right ventricles. Mechanical circulatory support devices (MCSDs) can be used to provide *temporary* ventricular assistance after cardiac surgery, with the assumption that ventricular function will recover rather quickly (days). Durable mechanical devices can be used for prolonged (months to years) circulatory support with the intent of bridge-to-transplant support, bridge to recovery (with the expectation of sufficient ventricular recovery to allow device explantation), or permanent (destination) therapy.

Mechanical pumping mechanisms can be placed internally *(implantable)* or external to the body *(paracorporeal).* Their power source can be *electric* or *pneumatic,* located outside the body or completely within it, with electric power conducted transcutaneously. Their pump flow characteristic can be *pulsatile* or *continuous flow*.

This chapter does not include use of biological means for MCS nor passive (non–energy imparting) devices used primarily to address ventricular remodeling (see Chapter 20). This chapter also does not include short term *temporary* devices.

# HISTORICAL NOTE

Early descriptions of mechanically supporting human circulation date back at least to the early 19th century in the writings of LeGallois.L1 Carrel and LindbergC1 as well as DemikhovS4 reported experimental application of mechanical support systems in animal models in the 1930s. However, major interest in mechanical support of human circulation would await the dawn of open heart surgery in the 1950s.

With successful application of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for a cardiac surgical operation by Gibbon in 1953 and the subsequent first successful series of cardiac operations using CPB by Kirklin and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic,K4 the stage was set for rapid proliferation of the technology of temporary MCS (in this case the heart-lung machine) for repair of cardiac malformations. Failure to successfully wean some patients from CPB stimulated surgeons to seek additional methods of mechanical support while awaiting myocardial recovery. Roller-pump technologyS7 was complicated by trauma to blood elements and difficulty in modulating pump speed in response to fluctuations in atrial filling pressures. The first application of a true ventricular assist device (VAD) was attributed to Michael DeBakey, who in 1966 reported the successful application of a pneumatically driven diaphragm pump for 10 days in a 37-year-old woman unable to be weaned from CPB following aortic and mitral valve replacements. Cooley subsequently reported the first successful bridge to transplantation in a 47-year-old man for 64 hours while awaiting heart transplantation with a pneumatically driven artificial heart, the Liotta Heart,L2 developed by the DeBakey-Baylor-Rice research team.

MCS research focused on pneumatic, electric, and even nuclear-powered designs through the 1980s.C3,C4,R4 The experimental work of Kolff, Olsen, Jarvik, and othersA1,D2,G6,M1 paved the way for the first permanent total artificial heart implant in Dr. Barney Clark by DeVries and his team in 1982.D4,D5 Five patients received permanent total artificial hearts under a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) protocol, with a maximum reported survival of 620 days. The close scrutiny of this initial trial of the Jarvik-7 total artificial heart stimulated intense and sometimes acrimonious debate among ethicists, economists, and healthcare experts about the application of expensive and human-intensive technologies in end-of-life situations.G4,J1,K2

Just as open heart surgery using CPB paved the way for early application of MCS, cardiac transplantation provided the stimulus for proliferation of ventricular assist systems as a bridging therapy to transplantation. With nearly 30% of patients dying while awaiting cardiac transplantation in the early 1980s, a clear need developed for effective and durable MCSDs that could safely support patients until suitable donor hearts could be identified. The improving outcomes following cardiac transplantation and the scarcity of available organs provided the impetus for a major collaborative effort among the heart transplantation community, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and scientists and clinicians dedicated to the development of durable MCS systems.F3 In 1984, Oyer, Portner, and colleaguesP3 reported the first successful cardiac transplant following bridging with a Novacor (WorldHeart Corp., Oakland, Calif.) left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Hill and colleagues subsequently published successful transplantation following support with a Pierce-Donachy pneumatic LVAD.H2 About the same time (1985), Copeland and colleagues performed the first planned total artificial heart implant as a bridge to transplantation. Continuing advancements in mechanical support over the ensuing decade led to the first FDA-approved implantable device as a bridge to transplantation in 1994.

Despite the early focus on MCS as a bridging therapy to transplantation, the clear intent of the scientific and engineering community was the development of devices capable of long-term safe circulatory support. The landmark feasibility study of long-term mechanical support was the Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure (REMATCH) trial. As reported by Rose and colleagues in 2001,R2 the HeartMate VE VAD provided significant survival benefit at 1 and 2 years compared with medical therapy for patients with very advanced heart failure who were not suitable for cardiac transplantation. This NIHsponsored multi-institutional trial provided the impetus for FDA approval of this device for so-called destination therapy in 2002. This set the stage for multiple clinical trials in the application of long-term mechanical support.

In recent years, device technology has increasingly focused on smaller, simpler, and likely more durable continuous flow (rotary) pumps that lack the pulsatile characteristics of earlier "first-generation" pumps. Following the earlier experimental work of Saxton, Andrews,S1 Wampler,W1 DeBakey,D2 and others,B5,B9,G1,R1 recent clinical applications have focused on axial flow and centrifugal pumps.

# BIOLOGICAL BARRIERS

# General Concepts

A *biomaterial* is a natural or artificial material that remains in contact with one or more internal components of the human body for the purpose of replacing organ function or treating an abnormal condition. *Biocompatibility* refers to the effect of a specific biomaterial on exposed host tissues, whereas *hemocompatibility* refers to the specific effects of a biomaterial or circulatory support system on blood components, coagulation cascade, and the tendency for thrombus formation. Successful blood pump design requires special knowledge of microlevel interactions between blood elements and the contact surface as well as macrolevel considerations that include choice of prosthetic valves (if required), inflow and outflow port design, and blood flow pathways within the pump.H5 The ideal biocompatible surface for blood is functioning endothelium, but the creation of a functioning endothelial layer on a bioprosthetic surface remains elusive. Minimizing thrombogenicity requires avoidance of highly

thrombogenic biomaterials, specific features of pump design, and pharmacologic inhibition of the coagulation cascade. The requirement for blood-exposed pump components that minimize thrombogenicity has limited compatible materials for blood-exposed surfaces to titanium, polymers (primarily polyurethanes), silicone, graphite, and pyrolytic carbon.K1

A fundamental concept for the understanding of blood– pump surface interaction is the process of protein adsorption to biomaterial surfaces.K10 Following exposure of pump surfaces to circulating blood in vivo, a protein layer develops that covers the biomaterial surface. The make-up of this protein layer is determined by the protein composition of the patient's blood, the chemical composition of the biomaterial surface (more specifically, surface charge and hydrophobicity), and surface topography (rough vs. smooth surface, porous vs. nonporous).H5 Concentration of proteins in blood, net protein charge relative to the biomaterial surface, distribution of charges on the protein surface, and ability of the protein to undergo conformational changes all contribute to the propensity for a given protein to adsorb to the pump surface.C2,D3 Protein interactions with the biomaterial vary over time and are therefore dynamic. The change in composition of proteins that adsorb to the pump surface over time is termed the *Vroman effect*. C7,D3 The specific details of these protein-surface interactions contribute directly to the likelihood of pump thrombogenicity, because these proteins are biologically active and can initiate platelet adhesion and activation and trigger coagulation cascades.

Both smooth and rough surface designs have been used successfully in pump design. The textured titanium surface of the HeartMate pulsatile LVAD stimulates the formation of a thin, stable coagulum that, although counterintuitive, has proven effective in minimizing development of pump thrombus.

Application of computer simulations called *computational fluid dynamics* (CFD) analyses has greatly facilitated the ability to predict the effects of shear stresses in the pump flow pathway and areas of relative stasis on platelet activation and thrombus formation.

## The Coagulation System

Contact between the pump surfaces and specific plasma proteins, including factor XII (Hageman factor), prekallikrein, and factor XI, can initiate the coagulation cascade via the *intrinsic clotting system* (also called the *contact system*) particularly in areas of relative blood stagnation (Fig. 22-1).

The additional critical component of thrombus formation is *platelet adhesion, aggregation,* and *activation*. Normal endothelium is antithrombogenic, in part related to active biochemical reactions involving nitric oxide and prostacyclins. In areas of low shear rates, fibronectin functions as the adhesive system for platelets, whereas von Willebrand factor (factor VIII) is the active adhesive protein for platelets at high shear rates,B8 particularly in combination with fibrinogen.

Adhesion of platelets to vascular subendothelium is facilitated by von Willebrand factor, which forms a bridge between collagen fibrils in the vessel wall and platelet receptors. Following contact activation, platelets undergo changes in shape in which they display spreading pseudopods and release the contents of their α granules (which contain fibrinogen, fibronectin, thrombospondin, von Willebrand factor, β-thromboglobulin, platelet factor IV, and platelet-derived growth factor), which stimulate thrombin generation. Platelet aggregation is stimulated by the release of adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Under laminar flow conditions, the released granule contents cannot accumulate, but when flow is nonlaminar, platelets are more likely to aggregate and accumulate. As newly recruited platelets release their granular contents, thrombin formation is facilitated by the generation of fibrinogen/fibrin bridges. Increasing thrombin generation accelerates the formation of thromboxane A2 and the release of ADP, which further promotes conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and platelet activation and aggregation. Damaged red cells from shear stress–induced hemolysis also release ADP, further perpetuating platelet activation.

Preserved vascular endothelial cell function is critical for prevention of intravascular thrombus. Synthesis and release of prostacyclins inhibits platelet activation. Thrombomodulin, an endothelial cell product, neutralizes the procoagulant properties of thrombin and activates protein C, a potent anticoagulant that destroys factors Va and VIIIa. Antithrombin III binds to the endothelial cell plasma membrane and inactivates thrombin.

Specific discussion on anticoagulation therapy for pumps can be found in Special Features of Postoperative Management.

# Immunologic Responses to Mechanical Circulatory Support

It remains controversial whether VADs differ in their propensity to induce an immunologic response. In vitro studies of the textured titanium surface of the HeartMate XVE indicate that T lymphocytes (probably activated helper T cells)B12 in the neointimal surface lining express strong immunoreactivity for CD3, CD4, and CD25 (interleukin [IL]-2 receptors). Demonstrated defects in T-cell function post implant induce T-cell apoptosis and possibly decreased resistance to infection.

A major disadvantage of MCS as a bridge to transplantation is the frequency of patient sensitization against foreign HLA antigens, which increases the likelihood of developing anti-HLA antibodies against a potential donor (positive crossmatch). Although the pump surface has been implicated in this process, it is more likely that transfused blood products, particularly platelets, account for sensitization. Platelets exhibit high concentrations of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II HLA antigens (in contrast to red blood cells), and patients receiving more than 6 platelet units are more likely to develop immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies against MHC class I antigens.H5

# ENGINEERING CONCEPTS IN PUMP DESIGN

## General Concepts

Specific technologic barriers challenging successful MCS include development of corrosion-resistant materials with minimal toxicity and a high level of structural integrity, management of specific blood-contacting surfaces to minimize thrombogenicity and damage to blood elements, blood pump design, and methods to store energy.

Energy to generate flow from circulatory assist pumps requires conversion of either electrical or pneumatic energy (compressed gas) into kinetic energy (energy of motion). Pulsatile or volume-displacement pumps are usually driven by electric motors that either transfer power directly to a pusher plate mechanism or compress gas or liquid in order to transfer energy to the blood sack or pusher plate. Continuous flow (rotary) pumps use electric motors to transmit kinetic energy to the blood.

The principles of Starling's law also apply to circulatory pumps, in that the pump must respond to higher inflow into the pump by increasing output. As in the natural heart, this balance is maintained in pulsatile pumps by variations in stroke volume or pump rate.

The major cause of hemolysis in blood pumps is rapid acceleration or deceleration of red cells through the pump, which can induce red cell membrane fracture. In general, pump-induced hemolysis is considered acceptable if the plasma free hemoglobin is maintained at less than 19 mg/dL. The rate of pressure increase and flow-channel velocities are maintained at levels designed to avoid high shear stress.

Proper application of fluid dynamics is critical to minimize thrombus formation. Because blood stasis—particularly flow cessation—promotes clot formation, stationary vortex flow must be avoided because the central stagnant portion of the vortex can become a nidus for thrombus formation.

Power sources and alarms must provide reliability and durability backed up by software programs designed to activate appropriate alarm systems when deviations from normal function occur. Approximately 1.6 watts of power are needed to pump 6 L/min at 120 mmHg. Power in excess of 1.6 watts is both wasted and converted to heat that must safely dissipate within the body.

# Pulsatile (Volume Displacement) versus Continuous Flow (Rotary) Pumps

Major pump designs in clinical use today are either pulsatile (volume displacement) or continuous flow (rotary) pumps, which include axial flow and centrifugal pump design. The main features of these basic pump designs are summarized in Table 22-1. *Pulsatile pumps* cyclically change the internal volume of a pumping chamber, displacing a specific volume of blood with each ejection. Such pumps require one-way valves to generate forward flow, typically utilizing valves in the inflow and outflow portions of the pump. In hermetically sealed (not vented to the atmosphere) pulsatile pumps, cyclic displacement of blood volume within the pumping chamber must be accompanied by an equal increase of volume elsewhere within the casing. This usually occurs via a compliance sack placed outside the device but within the patient.

*Continuous flow pumps* consist of a rotating component that has one or more impellers (usually a disk or cylinder with vanes that propel blood forward). One or more bearings support the impeller. The assembly comprising all rotating elements is termed the *pump rotor*. As the impeller rotates, it imparts rotational velocity to the blood, and this rotational energy must be converted into pressure energy to achieve forward blood flow. To facilitate this process, additional stationary blades or other structures redirect the swirling blood to create pressure and forward blood flow. In axial flow pumps, the stator typically consists of stationary blades, whereas the stator of a centrifugal pump typically consists of a scroll-shaped passage or volute.

The forward flow of blood through an axial flow pump is determined primarily by the speed of the rotor (pump speed) and the pressure difference across the inlet and outlet orifices of the pump. In the absence of obstruction to pump inflow, pressure at the outlet orifices (aorta) always exceeds inlet pressure (left ventricle). At any given pump speed, blood flow through the pump *increases* as the pressure difference across the inlet and outlet orifices *decreases*. At any pressure difference across inlet and outlet orifices, blood flow will increase with increasing pump speed. The relationship among flow, pressure, and pump speed is predicted by a series of flow pressure curves called *HQ curves* (Figs. 22-2 and 22-3). Under physiologic conditions, inlet pressure to the axial flow pump changes in a cyclic fashion during systolic and diastolic phases of the left ventricle. In most situations, even in the presence of severe left ventricular dysfunction and absence of opening of the aortic valve, continuous flow devices contribute some degree of pulsatility to the aortic pressure waveform

secondary to the changing differential pressure across the inlet and outlet orifices. Nonpulsatile blood flow occurs in situations of ventricular fibrillation, operation of the pump at too high a pump speed, or with negative inflow pressure causing left ventricular collapse around the inflow orifice.

Assessment of left ventricular volume status during axial flow pump support is facilitated by echocardiography, in which ventricular filling, presence or absence of aortic valve opening, and any tendency toward left ventricular chamber

collapse around the inflow cannula (suction event) can be assessed. Ideally, pump speed should be adjusted to permit intermittent aortic valve opening, which minimizes the risk of a suction event and may promote more effective washout of the sinuses of Valsalva, decreasing the likelihood of thrombus formation along the aortic valve. However, optimal operating conditions for exercise reserve and promotion of reverse remodeling remain controversial.B13,G5,H1

## Bearings and Seals

Proper design of bearings and seals within devices has provided a major challenge in the progress of MCS. *Bearings* are devices that provide support, guide movement, and reduce friction of motion between fixed and moving parts. A moving part may be a bladder or pusher plate in a pulsatile pump, or a rotary impeller in a rotary pump. Bearings pose a risk of wear, and therefore failure, secondary to continuous physical contact between solid components. Bearings that remain dry (without direct contact to blood) require special seals that are themselves subject to wear and failure. More recent secondgeneration pumps avoid seals by using blood itself as the lubricant fluid, with so-called blood-immersed bearings. The third generation of rotary pumps incorporates electromagnetic levitation; these magnetic bearings provide support through magnetic force fields.

# DURABLE CIRCULATORY SUPPORT DEVICES

#### Pulsatile Ventricular Assist Devices

# *Paracorporeal Ventricular Assist Devices*

Paracorporeal assist devices have a pump positioned outside the body cavity, with inflow and outflow cannulae that traverse the skin and subcutaneous tissues. The most commonly employed paracorporeal pump suitable for outpatient use is the Thoratec (Thoratec Corp., Pleasanton, Calif.) VAD.

The Thoratec paracorporeal ventricular assist device (PVAD) can be used for support of the left ventricle (LVAD), right ventricle (RVAD), or both ventricles (BVAD) (Fig. 22-4). The Thoratec PVAD received FDA approval for bridge-to–cardiac transplantation therapy in 1995 and has been implanted in more than 3000 patients.H3 The PVAD has a 65-mL stroke volume polyurethane chamber with two mechanical valves. The pneumatic driver applies alternating positive and negative air pressure to achieve a clinical beat rate of 40 to 110 beats/min. The PVAD is positioned on the anterior abdominal wall, with cannulas traversing the skin and mediastinum to provide connections to the heart and great vessels (Fig. 22-5). The device can be pneumatically actuated

in an ambulatory setting with a portable TLC-II (Thoratec) driver. The TLC-II was approved for home discharge by the FDA in 2003.

Chronic anticoagulation with warfarin is required, with a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5 to 3.5. Aspirin or other antiplatelet therapy is usually added to the anticoagulant regimen. Anticoagulation usually begins with heparin following cessation of bleeding, but some protocols recommend avoidance of heparin completely in the early anticoagulation phase.

## *Intracorporeal Assist Devices*

**Thoratec Implantable Ventricular Assist Device** The Thoratec implantable ventricular assist device (IVAD) is designed to provide all the same features as the PVAD, with pump placement in the intracorporeal position (Fig. 22-6). The IVAD has the same pumping chamber, mechanical valves, and stroke volume as the PVAD. The major differences in the IVAD include a smooth, polished titanium housing for implantability, lighter weight (339 g vs. 417 g), and a narrower 9-mm percutaneous lead, compared with the 20-mm paracorporeal driveline. An optical sensor detects when the pump is full or empty. Internal implantation is appropriate for patients with a body surface area (BSA) greater than about 1.6 m2 . The same anticoagulation regimen is used as for the PVAD.

**HeartMate XVE Left Ventricular Assist Device** The largest experience with durable pulsatile VADs stems from the HeartMate XVE LVAD, a variant of which was first

![](_page_6_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 22-6** Thoratec IVAD intracorporeal ventricular assist device.

introduced in 1986 with pneumatic power. More than 5000 patients have been treated with this device over the past 20 years, and it was used in the REMATCH trial, which led to its approval in the United States for permanent MCS therapy.

The HeartMate LVAD (Fig. 22-7) is a positivedisplacement pump made of titanium with a polyurethane diaphragm and a pusher-plate actuator that converts electrical energy to mechanical energy. It may be powered pneumatically or electrically, but only the vented electric version (XVE) is currently used. Cannulation involves a left ventricular apical cannula and an outflow graft to the ascending aorta. Two porcine valves provide directional flow.

The vented electric system is powered by an electric motor that rotates and displaces a pusher-plate that compresses the blood sack to initiate ejection. Air displaced by the diaphragm is vented to the atmosphere by a venting apparatus incorporated into the percutaneous driveline. The vent site provides a portal for pneumatic activation in the event of electrical failure. Power is supplied by two external batteries and an external controller.

Maximum stroke volume is 83 mL, and pumping may be performed in a fixed-rate or "automatic" mode, in which the stroke volume is maintained at a level of 97% full by varying the rate in response to preload. If the rate is adjusted manually, stroke volume should be maintained between 70 and 80 mL, because slower stroke volumes increase the potential for thrombogenesis.

The most unique feature of the HeartMate XVE device is the blood pumping surface, which consists of titanium microspheres and a fibrillar texture that promotes formation of a "pseudointima" that is resistant to thrombogenesis. The neointimal surface that develops is composed of collagen as well as cells derived from circulating progenitors of fibroblasts,

myofibroblasts, monocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells. Anticoagulation requirements for the XVE pump are unique among current MCS systems. The textured titanium surface creates a thrombo-resistant pump that requires only aspirin for effective anticoagulation. This creates a special indication for this pump in the setting of clinical comorbidities likely to produce bleeding complications during VAD support.F5,F6,O2,S5

Unfortunately, the major advantage of minimal anticoagulation requirements is currently outweighed by the poor long-term durability of this pump. With the current iteration of the XVE, bearing wear is a major source of device malfunction. Typically, the HeartMate XVE develops signs of bearing wear within 18 to 24 months (Box 22-1). Pump stoppage can be expected within days to weeks of the onset of signs of important bearing wear. When bearing wear is accompanied by transient pump stoppage or repetitive alarms, the patient can be switched to the pneumatic drive mode in the hospital setting while plans are made for surgical pump exchange. In the event of pump stoppage at home, emergent hand pumping can safely support the patient during transport to the hospital.

**Novacor Left Ventricular Assist Device** The Novacor LVAD (WorldHeart Corp., Oakland, Calif.; Fig. 22-8) holds a special place in the history of MCS as one of the first devices designed for permanent device support. In 1984, the Novacor was the first durable pump used as a successful bridge to transplantation.P1,P2,P3 Implanted in over 1600 patients worldwide, the Novacor has demonstrated high system reliability in the outpatient setting, with a low incidence of device malfunction.

The pump drive unit incorporates a dual pusher-plate pump mechanism coupled to a pulsed solenoid energy

converter driver. The percutaneous drive line contains the vent tube. Two porcine valves are incorporated in the inflow and outflow conduits.

Thromboembolic complications have been the major weakness of the Novacor device, despite standard anticoagulation with warfarin and antiplatelet agents. The primary source of particulate embolization was likely a friable pannus that often developed in the inflow conduit.H6,R2 Subsequent design modifications to include expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) have importantly reduced embolic events.E1,P1 In a multi-institutional analysis, the incidence of embolic stroke was 5.3% during an average support duration of 162 days using the modified inflow conduit.E1,S2

## Continuous Flow Ventricular Assist Devices

Rotary (continuous flow) pumps differ from volume displacement pumps in that instead of employing a chamber that changes volume and ejects blood via unidirectional valves, rotary pumps impart forward flow by rotating impellers with no valves. (See also discussion of continuous flow technology in Engineering Concepts in Pump Design.) These pumps are electrically driven and have the distinct advantages of small size and smaller drive lines. In contrast to volume displacement pumps, rotary devices are more afterload sensitive; at constant pump speed, the flow drops with increased systemic vascular resistance (see Fig. 22-2). The absence of inflow and outflow valves in rotary pumps improves overall pump durability and simplicity but removes a key failsafe feature of one-way valves: pulsatile pumps typically have a mechanism for hand pumping in the event of an electrical failure, but no such hand pumping device is available for rotary pumps. Specifically, pump stoppage with rotary pumps induces varying degrees of "aortic insufficiency," with nothing to prevent reversal of flow from aorta into ventricle during diastole. If not promptly corrected, this rare event is frequently fatal in the setting of advanced heart failure, which invariably accompanies pump implantation.

Although continuous flow pumps are usually not pulsatile to a degree that produces a palpable pulse (unless the native heart is rejecting), these rotary pumps typically produce some pulsatility in blood pressure (as measured with an indwelling arterial line) due to changing pump flows throughout the cardiac cycle.

Rotary pumps currently in clinical use are of two major types: axial flow and centrifugal flow. The designations *axial* and *centrifugal* refer specifically to the design of the impeller, without reference to the orientation of inlet or outlet ports. It is the rotation of the impeller that imparts rotational velocity to the blood, creating forward flow. *Pure axial flow pumps* act like a fan, adding energy by deflecting flow in the circumferential direction. *Centrifugal pumps* typically contain diskshaped impellers, with blood entering at the center of the impeller and exiting radially at the periphery. Typically, axial pumps feature inlet and outlet ports that are opposed 180 degrees from each another, and centrifugal pumps have ports oriented perpendicular to each other. Within this spectrum of pumps lies a continuum of mixed flow pumps, incorporating aspects of axial and centrifugal design.

## *HeartMate II*

Axial flow pumps in current use in clinical practice contain many features represented in the HeartMate II (Thoratec Corp., Pleasanton, Calif.), the only rotary pump currently approved (as of March 2011) by the FDA (Fig. 22-9). The blood pump component of the HeartMate II is composed of a straight titanium tube that houses the *inlet stator,* the fixed component that forms the pivotal housing for the rotor; the *rotor,* the rotational component that includes the impeller blades; the *rotor magnet,* which generates the magnetic field to induce impeller movement; and the *outlet stator,* which converts the radial velocity of blood flow to an axial directionS6 (Fig. 22-10). The other major pump components include the *inlet cannula,* implanted into the left ventricular apex, and the *outlet cannula,* which returns blood from the pump outlet to the ascending aorta.

The system driver sends electric power and operating signals to the pump and receives pump information. The wearable driver is powered by either a power base unit or two 12-volt rechargeable batteries that generally provide 2 to 4 hours of power. Power transmitted to the electric motor within the hub of the rotor creates a spinning magnetic field. The pump rotor spins on two bearings located at the inlet and outlet stators. The rotor that spins within the magnetic field is the only moving component of the device. Ceramic bearings are washed by the flow of blood. Operating pump speed ranges from 6000 to 15,000 rpm and is capable of generating blood flow up to about 8 L/min. The approximate pump weight is 350 g, with a length of 7 cm and diameter of 4 cm.

Special features of the HeartMate II pump include a flexible joint between the intraventricular portion of the cannula

and its connection to a titanium elbow that joins the pump. The flexible portion of the inlet cannula reduces the risk of malalignment of the intraventricular portion of the inlet cannula with respect to the ventricular cavity. The inlet cannula design reduces torque on the intraventricular portion of the inlet cannula. An extension in the length of the intraventricular rigid cannula improves reliability of continuous flow throughout the cardiac cycle and at various levels of left ventricular filling. The pump rotor, blood tube within the pump housing, and inlet and outlet stators are smooth titanium surfaces. The inlet and outlet elbows and the intraventricular cannula are textured with titanium microsphere coatings similar to the design of the HeartMate XVE.R3,S5

# *MicroMed-DeBakey Left Ventricular Assist Device*

The MicroMed-DeBakey LVAD (MicroMed Cardiovascular Inc., Houston, Tex.) is an axial flow pump which consists of an elbow-shaped inflow cannula that inserts into the left ventricular apex, a pump housing unit, a Dacron outflow graft which connects to the ascending aorta, and an ultrasonic flow probe that encircles the outflow grafts and provides direct measurement of pump flow (Fig. 22-11). The pump impeller is actuated by an electromagnet and is the only moving part of the pump system. Wiring from the pump and the flow probe are contained in a flexible driveline that connects to the portable controller. External components include a controller system that operates the pump and a clinical data acquisition system. A potential advantage of this pump is the presence of a flow probe that allows accurate rather than estimated pump flow. Only the pediatric version of this pump (DeBakey Child) is FDA approved, but the adult version has been extensively used in Europe.

# *Jarvik 2000 Left Ventricular Assist Device*

This and the remaining continuous flow pumps discussed are not yet FDA approved in the U.S. The Jarvik 2000 (Jarvik Heart Inc., New York, N.Y.) is an electrically powered,

axial-flow blood pump that provides continuous flow from the left ventricle to the ascending or descending thoracic aorta (Fig. 22-12). A unique feature of this device is the placement of the axial flow pump within the left ventricular cavity. The overall system consists of the blood pump, a Dacron outflow graft, percutaneous power cable, pump speed controller, and direct-current power supply. The single moving part is the impeller located in the center of the titanium housing. Electromagnetic forces rotate the impeller, which consists of an electromagnet suspended by two ceramic bearings. All blood-contacting surfaces are made of smooth titanium. The pump operates at 8000 to 12,000 rpm and can generate flows up to 8 L/min. This pump is particularly suited to "off-pump" implantation as described in Techniques of Operation.

# *CorAide Left Ventricular Assist Device*

The Arrow CorAide LVAD (Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland, Ohio) is a centrifugal-flow electrically powered third-generation LVAD (Fig. 22-13). The pump can be operated in a fixed-speed mode or an automaticcontrol mode in which the pump speed varies according to heart rate and systemic blood pressure. The pump and electrical cable weighs about 300 g and operates at speeds between 2000 and 3000 rpm. Pump flow rates are up to 8 L/min. Blood contact surfaces are fabricated from titanium. The rotating assembly uses a combination of magnetic forces and hydrodynamic forces for suspension, in which there is no surface contact with the bearings. A unique apical cuff clamp allows positioning and fixation of the apical cannula to optimize pump flow.

## *DuraHeart*

The Terumo DuraHeart (Terumo Heart Inc., Ann Arbor, Mich.) is a magnetically levitated centrifugal pump (Fig. 22-14). Contact-free rotation of the impeller contributes to minimal material wear, making the pump design favor a high level of durability. The blood-contacting surfaces of the pump and the inlet conduit are made of titanium and modified with a heparin coating. The pump weighs 540 g and has a diameter of 7.2 cm and a height of 5 cm, suitable for patients with a 1.3 m2 or greater BSA.

# *EVAHEART*

The EVAHEART (Sun Medical Technology Research Corp., Nagano, Japan) is a centrifugal pump with a weight of 420 g (Fig. 22-15). The pump contains a thromboresistant coating over its blood contact surfaces. The pump contains a unique system whereby the impeller rotates on a shaft and is cooled with fluid (Cool-Seal) pumped by way of a percutaneous channel from an external device that circulates behind the mechanical seal and removes debris. The 16-mm inflow and outflow conduits are made of PTFE.

## *HeartWare*

The HeartWare LVAD (HeartWare Ltd., Sydney, Australia) is a miniaturized centrifugal flow pump that sits entirely within the pericardial cavity (Fig. 22-16). A unique feature is the left ventricular apical inflow cannula, which is an integral part of the pump. The device weighs only 145 g but can generate flows up to 10 L/min. An apical sewing ring attaches to the left ventricular apex and allows adjustment of the inflow cannula orientation. Impeller blades are held in place by a hybrid magnetic and hydrodynamic bearing system.

## Total Artificial Heart

The major advantage of the total artificial heart (TAH) over VADs is the provision for biventricular support with an implantable device. (The only currently available implantable separate right and left VAD system is the Thoratec IVAD system [see previous section].) The major disadvantage of the TAH is the necessity of removing the native heart, which removes the option of recovery. The second major disadvantage of current iterations is the space requirement for the device, such that only patients with a BSA of about 1.7 m2 or greater are suitable.

The two TAH devices currently available for clinical use are the SynCardia CardioWest C-70 TAH and the AbioCor TAH. Both pumps replace the native ventricles and all four valves in the orthotopic position.

## *SynCardia Total Artificial Heart*

The SynCardia TAH (SynCardia Systems Inc., Tucson, Ariz.) is a pneumatic pulsatile pump in which a rigid spherical outer housing around each artificial ventricle supports a seamless blood-contacting segmented polyurethane diaphragm, two intermediate diaphragms, and an air diaphragm (Fig. 22-17). Two Medtronic 27-mm inflow valves and two Medtronic 25-mm outflow valves provide unidirectional flow. The full ejection volume of each ventricle is 70 mL per beat, and the TAH typically generates a cardiac output of 7 to 8 L/min. The atrial components are sewn to the native atrial cuffs, and the atrioventricular and ventricular outflow graft connections are via "quick snap" connectors. The external console consists of one primary and one secondary pneumatic driver, air tanks,

transport batteries, an alarm, and a computer monitoring system. Current portable pneumatic drivers and consoles allow out-of-hospital living with full ambulation.

## *AbioCor Total Artificial Heart*

The AbioCor (Abiomed, Danvers, Mass.) is the first totally implantable heart replacement system that does not require percutaneous lines (Fig. 22-18). The four internal components are the thoracic unit, battery, controller, and transcutaneous energy transfer (TET) coil. Situated between the two artificial ventricles is an energy converter that contains a miniature centrifugal pump that moves hydraulic fluid alternately between left and right ventricles, producing alternate left and right systole. A balance chamber allows for adjustment of right-sided stroke volume to compensate for bronchial blood flow. All blood contact surfaces, including the trileaflet valves (24-mm internal diameter) are polyurethane. An internal controller drives the energy converter in the thoracic unit, monitors the implanted components, and transmits device performance data to an external console via radiofrequency telemetry. An internal TET coil receives high-frequency power across the skin from an external TET coil that powers the thoracic unit and charges an internal battery. Current software directs changes in pump rate in response to venous return to the heart.

## TECHNIQUES OF OPERATION

# Intracorporeal Pulsatile Left Ventricular Assist Device

Conventional CPB is recommended for most implants. In the setting of prior cardiac surgery, percutaneous catheters should be placed in the femoral artery and vein, which facilitates

**Figure 22-18** AbioCor total artificial heart.

rapid initiation of CPB in the event of bleeding or acute cardiac decompensation during sternotomy.

A pulmonary artery catheter is routinely advised to assess the response of pulmonary artery pressure to pharmacologic interventions and device implantation. Continuous measurement of pulmonary artery and central venous (or right atrial) pressures provides critical information in determining the need for inhaled nitric oxide and/or biventricular support.

Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is necessary during MCS implants for assessment of biventricular function, evaluation of aortic insufficiency and presence of a patent foramen ovale, identification of intracardiac and aortic air bubbles during implantation and subsequent de-airing maneuvers, and assessment of inflow cannula position within the left ventricle.

Prior to sternotomy, formal discussions occur with anesthesia and echocardiography colleagues regarding the pulmonary artery and central venous pressures (CVP) and interventions to optimize right ventricular function, the presence and severity of aortic insufficiency and any need to address the aortic valve surgically (see Special Issues in Mechanical Circulatory Support), the presence or absence of intraventricular thrombus, and the presence of a patent foramen ovale (which if present has to be surgically closed to prevent postimplant arterial desaturation).

Prior to initiating CPB, any pockets necessary for device implantation are developed. If an intracorporeal device that requires an intraabdominal pocket is planned, the abdominal cavity is opened and a porous PTFE membrane is implanted to isolate the pump from the intraabdominal contents and allow drainage of blood around the pump through the porous membrane into the peritoneal cavity.H5 In creating space for the left ventricular inflow cannula, leftward dissection along the diaphragm must extend far enough to allow proper alignment of the cannula within the left ventricular cavity. Insufficient leftward dissection (often requiring entry into the left pleural space) will result in inadequate leftward positioning of the inflow cannula (particularly with a markedly enlarged heart and leftward displacement of the apex) such that the inflow portion points against that lateral wall rather than into the central portion of the left ventricular cavity, producing chronic partial inflow obstruction.

CPB is established with ascending aorta and right atrial cannulation (unless emergent femoral cannulation is required). After initiation of CPB, the heart is maintained in a continuously beating state without cardioplegic arrest unless additional cardiac procedures are needed. Strong suction is maintained on the aortic needle vent and continuous surveillance by TEE is important for detection of any air in the ascending aorta. The left ventricular apex is displaced, and an opening is created in the left ventricle for insertion of the apical cannula. For most devices, creation of the hole is facilitated by a special coring instrument. The left ventricle is inspected for presence of any thrombus, which if present is removed.

The apical cannula for some devices is inserted directly into the left ventricular apex, and for others, an inflow collar is first sutured to the left ventricular apex and the apical cannula is inserted through the collar. Interrupted 2-0 sutures are recommended, often with an additional purse string of polypropylene for improved hemostasis.

The pump is then completely assembled, including the outflow graft, while maintaining the heart in a filled state to avoid trapping of air in the left ventricle. The apical inflow cannula is inserted and secured during continuous TEE surveillance of the ascending aorta for air. Surgical glue is often placed around the insertion site for added hemostasis. With the heart and pump filled with blood, the operating table is rotated away from the surgeon, and the pump is de-aired to allow residual air in the pump to collect in the outflow graft and be eliminated. When no further residual intercardiac air is identified by TEE, the outflow graft is measured to an appropriate length, trimmed, and clamped proximally. An end-to-side anastomosis is then constructed to the exteriorized right lateral aspect of the ascending aorta, usually with continuous 4.0 polypropylene suture. This suture line is particularly hemostatic if constructed in two layers, the first layer being a continuous horizontal mattress suture followed by a second standard layer. The drive line is brought out through a long subcutaneous tunnel, usually in the right upper quadrant. Specific care must be taken to avoid inadvertent passage of the drive line through the intraperitoneal space.

Appropriate inotropic support is initiated to optimize right ventricular function, with or without the addition of inhaled nitric oxide. The driveline and its connecting tubing is passed off the surgical field and connected to the pump console. With the outflow graft clamped (initially fully, then partially) near its connection to the aorta, standard de-airing procedures are carried out under TEE guidance, with needle vents both in the outflow graft and the ascending aorta.

Full pumping is established, and CPB is discontinued with continued surveillance by TEE for air and right ventricular function. Surveillance of right ventricular function is particularly important during the first 10 to 15 minutes after discontinuation of CPB and during protamine administration.

Prior to sternal closure, the outflow graft and apical cannulation site should be covered with bovine pericardium or PTFE patches to facilitate safe sternotomy and dissection at the time of cardiac transplantation.

## Intracorporeal Continuous Flow Left Ventricular Assist Device

Implantation of continuous flow devices follows the same general surgical plan as for pulsatile devices, with a few notable differences. Because the pumps are smaller than most pulsatile devices, the pump pocket requires either no additional dissection or limited dissection at the level of the diaphragm on the left side to allow the pump to sit in a position that does not compromise the inflow cannula position. When the usual de-airing procedure has been completed and CPB discontinued, close surveillance of right ventricular function by TEE, right atrial pressures, and direct observation is of critical importance. Because rotary pumps of either axial or centrifugal design will continue pumping at the set speed, sudden right ventricular failure can limit blood return to the left ventricle to such a degree that air is sucked in around the inflow cannula and can potentially cause a major air embolism. This contrasts with pulsatile pumps, which either fill completely before emptying (auto mode) or can eject blood from a partially filled sac (fixed-rate mode), which greatly reduces the risk of air entrapment.

In the event of sudden, severe right ventricular failure early post bypass with a continuous flow pump, left atrial or pulmonary artery diastolic pressure should be carefully observed for rapid fall, and pump speed should then be rapidly decreased while observing for aortic air by TEE. If air is seen in the ascending aorta, the outflow graft must be clamped and CPB rapidly reestablished when heparinization is adequate.

Implantation of continuous flow pumps without CPB have been described, particularly for the Jarvik 2000 axial flow pump. The silicone polyester sewing cuff is attached to the apex of the beating left ventricle with pledgeted sutures. With the patient in Trendelenburg position to avoid air entrapment, a coring knife is used to create a suitable incision within the sewing cuff. The pump is rapidly inserted and secured with cotton tape around the cuff and pump housing. The outflow graft can be anastomosed to either the ascending or descending thoracic aorta. Frazier and colleaguesC5 have described transdiaphragmatic pump placement through a subcostal extrathoracic approach.

Replacement of failing pulsatile LVADs with continuous flow pumps requires special comment. Currently, the most common indication for pump exchange is bearing wear causing pump failure of the HeartMate XVE 18 to 24 months post implant (see "Pulsatile Ventricular Assist Devices" under Durable Circulatory Support Devices). Catheters are placed in the femoral artery and vein to allow rapid percutaneous cannulation for CPB in the event of uncontrolled bleeding. A repeat sternotomy is recommended for optimal access to both the inflow cannula and outflow graft. The apical sewing cuff and collar from the XVE is retained for simplified insertion of the apical cannula of the HeartMate II pump. The smaller HeartMate II outflow graft is connected directly to the larger residual outflow graft with a beveled anastomosis. Device de-airing is accomplished as usual. If a PTFE membrane was used in the XVE pocket, it should be removed to minimize the presence of foreign bodies around the new pump.

# Paracorporeal Ventricular Assist Devices

Implantation of paracorporeal devices follows the same general procedure as for intracorporeal pumps, with the exception that the inflow and outflow cannulae are passed through subcutaneous tunnels following implantation and then connected to the pump itself. Specific protocols are followed for de-airing individual pumps via direct portals, or aspiration techniques of the pump itself following connection to the outflow graft. When biventricular support is needed, the LVAD is generally implanted first. The right ventricular device can receive inflow from either the right ventricle or right atrium. The position of skin exit for right and left ventricular inflow and outflow cannulae on the anterior abdomen must be carefully planned to allow appropriate spacing of the cannulae.

# Total Artificial Heart

The technique for implantation of the SynCardia TAH has been described in detail by Copeland and colleagues.C5 Before systemic heparinization, the arterial outflow conduits are appropriately preclotted, and drivelines are tunneled and brought out under the left costal margin. The left-sided ventricular driveline is positioned approximately 5 cm below the costal margin in the midclavicular line. The right ventricular driveline is brought through the skin about 5 cm medial to the left driveline. Both ventricles are then covered with a surgical towel and placed on the left chest until implantation.

CPB is established and the aorta cross-clamped. The recipient heart is excised on the ventricular side of the atrioventricular (AV) groove, leaving a small rim of ventricular muscle. The great vessels are divided just above the aortic and pulmonary valves (Fig. 22-19). The mitral and tricuspid valve leaflets are excised and the chordae trimmed. The coronary sinus ostium in the right atrium is oversewn to prevent backflow of blood to the AV groove.

A "neopericardium" is constructed out of three 15- × 20-cm sheets of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE). The first sheet of ePTFE is sutured to the pericardial reflection as posteriorly as possible at the level of the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, and pulmonary veins on the right side (without injuring the phrenic nerve); the second sheet is sutured anterior to the left pulmonary veins on the left side; and the third sheet is placed to cover the entire diaphragmatic reflection. The three ePTFE sheets are later folded over the artificial ventricles after completion of the implantation.

The outer rims of the left and right atrial cuffs, which consist of approximately 1 cm of ventricular muscle and fat in the AV groove, are buttressed circumferentially with 1-cm-wide strips of Teflon felt to reinforce the anastomoses between the atrial cuffs and the quick connects and provide maximal hemostasis. The atrial quick connects are trimmed to 6 mm from the connectors, turned inside out, and anastomosed to the atrial cuff (first left, then right), using 3-0 polypropylene. The suture line includes the felt strip– strengthened free ventricular wall and the interventricular septum, taking care to achieve a maximally hemostatic suture line. After completion of both anastomoses, the quick connects are everted back to normal configuration, and biological glue is applied to the suture lines.

![](_page_13_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Figure 22-19** Ventricular rim with AV valves and chordae excised. Great vessels are transected just above sinotubular junction. (Redrawn from Copeland and colleagues.C5)

The outflow conduits from each artificial ventricle are cut to an appropriate length, determined by briefly placing the artificial ventricles in the mediastinum. The entire length of the pulmonary artery is preserved and anastomosed to the conduit with 4-0 polypropylene. The aortic anastomosis is similarly constructed. All suture lines are tested for hemostasis using a plastic tester device with saline via a three-way stopcock (Fig. 22-20).

The ventricular connections to the quick connects are facilitated by grasping each side of the quick connect with a large clamp while pushing in the device. To avoid conduit angulation, the left ventricular outflow should be as close as possible to the native aorta. Orientation of the ventricle and the outflow mount is fixed by the atrial connection. Prior to completing the aortic connection, the pump and conduit are filled with saline. The right atrial inflow quick connect and the right arterial conduit are attached to the right artificial ventricle similarly. The right side is filled by partially releasing the inferior vena cava tape, completing device implantation (Fig. 22-21).

The patient is placed in steep Trendelenburg, and the aortic cross-clamp is removed with the ascending aorta vented. With the CardioWest TAH pumping at 40 beats/ min, vigorous de-airing is completed under TEE guidance. The TAH pumping rate is then increased and CPB discontinued while maintaining a CVP of 12 to 15 mmHg. Cardiac output from the CardioWest TAH is usually about 7 to 8 L/ min at this point. After obtaining meticulous hemostasis, the previously secured ePTFE "neopericardium" is closed over

the TAH anteriorly. A rectangular piece of ePTFE is passed around the proximal aorta and secured. During chest closure, special attention is focused on device output and TEE monitoring of inferior vena caval and left pulmonary venous flows.

The technique for implantation of the AbioCor TAH has been described in detail by Dowling and colleagues.C5,D6 The

**Figure 22-22** The AbioCor thoracic unit is brought into the surgical field after anastomosis of outflow grafts to great vessels. (Redrawn from Copeland and colleagues.C5)

details and principles of implantation are similar to the Syn-Cardia device, with the following notable features. Because the device has no external driveline, a slight caudal extension of the incision facilitates placement of the transcutaneous energy transfer coils anterior to the pectoral muscle fascia prior to heparinization. Following median sternotomy, dissection for placement of the internal battery and controller is performed in either the preperitoneal space or deep to the rectus abdominis muscle.

After initiation of CPB and aortic cross-clamping, the right and left ventricles are excised just below the AV groove to allow for anastomosis of the atrial cuffs at the level of the anuli after excision of the mitral and tricuspid valves. The left atrial appendage is ligated and the coronary sinus and any patent foramen ovale oversewn. The left, and subsequently right, atrial cuff is trimmed to an appropriate diameter and anastomosed to the native atrium at the level of the anulus, using continuous 4-0 polypropylene reinforced with felt strips. A leak-testing device is used to check each anastomosis. A cast model of the AbioCor unit is placed in the mediastinum to determine the appropriate length and orientation of the outflow grafts. The grafts are sewn end-to-end to the great vessels (4-0 polypropylene), with the aortic outflow graft placed anterior to the pulmonary artery graft (Fig. 22-22).

The pumping unit is placed in the mediastinum, and the four connections are made via snap-lock connectors. Each chamber is filled with saline prior to connecting the aortic and pulmonary outflow grafts. With the outflow grafts clamped, de-airing is accomplished via side ports on the outflow grafts, first on the right side after releasing the caval tapes, and then on the left side, allowing the right ventricle to pump blood through the pulmonary circulation. Following complete de-airing, the cross-clamp is removed, the left

side port is occluded, and the patient is weaned from CPB to full device support (Fig. 22-23).

Following CPB, TEE is performed to identify any in creased flow velocity from the pulmonary veins as a sign of impaired flow from the left pulmonary veins. If repositioning of the device is necessary, it can be sutured to the left lower ribs or repositioned with a diaphragm patch.W3

# SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

# Anticoagulation

The mainstay of pump anticoagulation therapy involves blockade of the intrinsic contact coagulation cascade and platelet aggregation. (See further discussion under Biological Barriers.)

## *Heparin*

The primary anticoagulant effect of heparin results from heparin binding to antithrombin III, and that complex inactivates thrombin (and thrombin-induced activation of factors V and VIII) and to some degree factors Xa, XIIa, Xla, and IXa.

# *Warfarin*

Warfarin inhibits the vitamin K–dependent factors II, VII, IX, and X. During the 5 to 7 days generally required for effective inhibition of these factors, warfarin actually creates a relatively hypercoagulable state through inhibition of the natural anticoagulants protein C and protein S.

# *Antiplatelet Therapy*

The mainstay of antiplatelet activity is aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]). Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase, an enzyme responsible for conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin and eventually thromboxane A2, which promotes platelet aggregation. Effectiveness of aspirin therapy can be monitored by the in vitro platelet aggregation response to arachidonic acid.W3 The antithromboembolic effect of aspirin does not increase with dosages greater than about 325 mg/day, and there is probably no advantage for doses greater than 160 mg/day.W3 The ADP pathway for induction of platelet activation is not inhibited by aspirin, and ADP receptors play a central role in platelet activation secondary to shear stress.S3

Clopidogrel irreversibly inhibits platelet activation via ADP receptors on the platelet surface. Dipyridamole inhibits platelet aggregation through a different mechanism. Specifically, dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets and endothelial cells, effectively increasing local adenosine concentration. The excess adenosine stimulates platelet adenylate cyclase, which increases platelet cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, inhibiting platelet aggregation response to ADP, collagen, and plateletactivation factor.

# *Anticoagulation for Continuous Flow Pumps*

The anticoagulation of all currently available rotary pumps includes warfarin and antiplatelet therapy (usually with aspirin). Initial anticoagulation with heparin is recommended in some protocols, though others have successfully avoided heparin without identifiable thromboembolic effects. A simplified anticoagulation protocol employs clopidogrel, aspirin 325 mg twice daily, and warfarin beginning the day after implantation. Clopidogrel is continued until the INR exceeds 2.0, after which warfarin is adjusted to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0.

# *Anticoagulation for the Total Artificial Heart*

Specific protocols have been developed for the SynCardia and AbioCor TAHs.C5,K6 Warfarin and antiplatelet agents are routinely combined with additional monitoring by thromboelastography and platelet aggregation studies.

# Blood Pressure Management with Continuous Flow Pumps

Although pulsatile flow can usually be detected by direct arterial line monitoring in the early postimplant period, ambulatory blood pressure cannot be reliably measured with a standard blood pressure cuff or with automatic blood pressure devices. The normal Korotkoff sounds are typically absent with the minimal pulsation of continuous flow pumps. The most reliable estimate of mean or systolic blood pressure (depending on degree of pulsatility) is use of a Doppler device over the radial artery while gradually deflating a standard blood pressure cuff. Monitoring outpatient blood pressure with continuous flow pumps is important because of the occasional development of severe hypertension (possibly related to abnormal autonomic deregulation), which, if undetected and untreated, can result in a major intracerebral bleeding event.

# Ventricular Suction

When pump speed in a rotary pump exceeds the ability of the left ventricle to supply a continuous inflow of blood into the inlet cannula, the resultant rapid decrease in size of the ventricular chamber can result in cavitary collapse around the inlet cannula, which impedes entrance of blood and creates a "suction event." The result is a sudden decrease in pump flow. Ventricular suction is remedied by decreasing pump speed. The HeartMate II device detects sudden changes in pump flow by a change in *pulsatility index* (a measure of flow pulse through the pump described by the relationship: pulse index = [maximum flow − minimum flow] / mean flow). Sudden drops in pulsatility index and a decrease in pump flow indicates a likely suction event. The HeartMate II device incorporates a suction detection algorithm in which pump speed automatically reduces to 9000 rpm if a sudden change in pump flow pulsatility is detected, after which the pump speed slowly returns to the set speed. Observation of this phenomenon indicates the need to reduce the set pump speed.

## Pump Thrombus in Continuous Flow Pumps

If thrombus develops on the pump rotor, an abnormal increase in power is required to maintain impeller speed. The increase in power consumption causes an inaccurately high estimate of pump flow and a decrease in pulsatility index caused by a reduction in cyclic power consumption (because continuously high power consumption is caused by the rotor drag induced by thrombus). In contrast, inlet obstruction (secondary to inlet cannula misalignment or thrombus on the inlet cannula orifice), or outflow obstruction (such as kinking of the outflow graft or anastomotic narrowing) produces a decrease in power consumption along with decreased pump flow and pulsatility index. The diagnosis of inflow or outflow obstruction can be aided by echocardiographic imaging, which may reveal a dilated left ventricle, which is not improved by increasing pump speed.

## Pump Stoppage of Continuous Flow Pumps

In contrast to pulsatile devices (in which a hand-pumping device is usually available), continuous flow pumps carry no manual option to maintain forward pump flow in the event of pump stoppage. The physiologic sequelae of pump stoppage are discussed in "Continuous Flow Ventricular Assist Devices."

When pump stoppage occurs, most commonly resulting from damage to the driveline, rapid decompensation and death are common secondary to a combination of severe reduction in cardiac output and a variable degree of "pump/ aortic" insufficiency due to the absence of valves. If the patient is viable, emergency transport to an experienced MCS center is mandatory while cardiac output is maximized with inotropic support. Upon hospital arrival, a surgical team should be ready for emergency device exchange. An echocardiogram is necessary to evaluate for possible intracavitary left ventricular thrombus. If no thrombus is identified and soldering of damaged electrical wiring is an option, full heparinization followed by device restart (with the small possibility of thromboembolic stroke) may provide a more favorable risk/benefit ratio than emergency reoperation for pump exchange.

# RESULTS

## Survival

Survival and adverse events following MCSD implant are reported and analyzed in the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) supported by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Among isolated LVADs approved by the FDA for use in the United States, the 12- and 24-month survival are 74% and 55% (Fig. 22-24). The requirement for biventricular support confers a significantly worse prognosis (Fig. 22-25).

Major causes of death among LVAD patients differ according to interval post implant. The most frequent cause of death during the first 30 days is cardiac failure, followed by multiorgan failure and stroke (Table 22-2). After the first month, infection is the major cause of mortality. The hazard function for death in the current era (see Fig. 22-24) has a rapidly falling early phase that merges with a gradually increasing phase at about 6 months. Risk factors for death after LVAD implant include older patient age, indicators of more advanced right heart failure, cardiogenic shock at implant, and pulsatile (vs. continuous flow) pumps (Table 22-3).

## Major Adverse Events

## *Neurologic Events*

The most devastating *early* complication is severe neurologic injury, usually caused by embolization of particulate matter or air. Air embolization constitutes a greater risk after device implant than during other forms of cardiac surgery. In addition to the potential for air trapping in the left atrium or left ventricle, the pump itself adds a major source of air. Even if the pump is adequately de-aired, negative pressures generated by a blood pump can suck air in through porous conduits or around cannulation sites if the left ventricle is severely underfilled. Specific maneuvers to prevent this complication include:

- 1. Continuous TEE monitoring of the left atrium, left ventricle, and aortic root during the terminal phases of CPB and for 10 to 15 minutes after discontinuation of bypass
- 2. Thorough de-airing of the pump with hand pumping (for some pulsatile devices) or short bursts of power to

- the pump (for some pulsatile devices and most rotary pumps)
- 3. Appropriate support and observation of right ventricular function after bypass to avoid sudden drops in right ventricular output to the LVAD
- 4. Minimizing the use of vacuum pressures until the chest is closed

The potential for thromboembolic events during and after CPB can be greatly reduced by careful examination of the left ventricular cavity by TEE prior to implant, and direct inspection of the left ventricular cavity during implantation of the inflow cannula.

Later neurologic events are generally categorized as either hemorrhagic or thromboembolic. With the exception of the HeartMate XVE (see earlier section) all other pulsatile and rotary pumps currently employed are considered inherently thrombogenic. Neutralizing this complication requires detailed analysis of thromboembolic events and a better understanding of the role of the device itself, the patient's underlying medical condition, and the selection and management of specific anticoagulation regimens.

A relationship between clinical infections and subsequent thromboembolic strokes following MCSD implant has been observed in multiple centers, but a causal relationship and potential mechanisms such as activation of inflammatory mediators with procoagulant effect remain unproven.

Alterations in the underlying coagulation system that are not identified by the INR, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and platelet count (see "The Coagulation System" under Biological Barriers) may contribute to development of hemorrhage or thromboembolic strokes post MCSD. The

Major pump-related infections involve either the pump pocket or the driveline at the exit site. Overall freedom from major infection among 420 patients in the INTERMACS database is depicted in Fig. 22-26. In the REMATCH trial of the HeartMate XVE pulsatile LVAD, infections, including driveline and other device-related infections, were the leading cause of death.R2 As experience with devices has evolved, the frequency of pump infections has progressively declined. Placement of larger pulsatile pumps in an intraperitoneal pocket using a porous PTFE sheet has reduced the risk of pocket infections.H4,I1 Smaller rotary pumps rarely develop pocket infections, particularly those that are totally intrapericardial.

Driveline infections continue to plague long-term circulatory support and will undoubtedly be an ongoing limitation until totally implantable systems are available. The most important maneuver to minimize late development of exit site infections appears to be total immobilization of the driveline at the exit site, preferably using a double stabilization technique (Fig. 22-27) to minimize transmitted driveline tension or movement at the exit site. Other advances such as novel applications of biofilm technology,B2,C6,W4 instillation of biosubstances to promote tissue ingrowth around the driveline, and the potential use of muscle flaps around the driveline offer promise in reducing pump-related infections.

## *Gastrointestinal Bleeding*

Rarely, bleeding from intestinal arteriovenous malformations (present in 10% of normal adults)F4 is observed with continuous flow pumps (rotary devices).G3 This complication has also been reported in patients with aortic stenosis.

#### *Other Adverse Events*

The overall profile of adverse events in the current era is detailed in Table 22-4, separated by type of pump technology. Continuous flow pumps are currently associated with a major reduction in device malfunction and infection compared with pulsatile pumps during the first 6 months post implant.K8

## SPECIAL ISSUES IN MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT

## Emergence of Continuous Flow Technology

The current preference for continuous flow technology as bridge-to-transplant therapy is reflected by data from INTER-MACS, in which more than 85% of primary LVAD implants in the current era are continuous flow technology (Fig. 22-28). Survival data to date indicate a significant advantage with continuous flow technology (Fig. 22-29).

With current reporting, identification of hypertension with continuous flow pumps is unreliable.

20 mmHg or higher), the likelihood is great that organ function will be importantly compromised secondary to chronic venous congestion, and/or left ventricular filling will be inadequate (secondary to inadequate right ventricular output) to provide effective LVAD flow. However, the advantages of biventricular support must be balanced against reduced success in bridging to transplantation with BVAD therapy compared with isolated LVAD support (see Fig. 22-25). A possible exception to this strategy is use of the TAH for bridging or permanent therapy.

With current implantable pulsatile or continuous flow pumps (with the exception of the TAH), the addition of right ventricular support requires a paracorporeal device. If the device cannot be successfully removed during initial hospitalization, the longer-term (outpatient) quality of life is dramatically reduced.

Although considerable variability exists in protocols at individual institutions, biventricular support should be considered if, despite appropriate doses of right ventricular inotropic support, there continues to be very poor right ventricular function (as judged by echocardiography), and signs of right ventricular failure persist (CVP in excess of 18 mmHg, ascites, and/or peripheral edema). In the operating room following implantation of an LVAD, the addition of right ventricular support should be considered if CVP persists at a level above about 19 mmHg, and cardiac output (LVAD output) is depressed despite administration of nitric oxide and suitable right ventricular inotropic support.

Given the distinctly inferior survival and postimplant quality of life when biventricular device support is required, a major therapeutic priority in advanced heart failure management should focus on referral for MCS before the advent of advanced right ventricular failure.

# Aortic Insufficiency

Aortic insufficiency decreases pump efficiency by creating a loop of flow between the LVAD and the native left ventricle. Therefore, native aortic insufficiency should be recognized. In the presence of grade 3/5 or greater aortic insufficiency, specific management of the aortic valve is advisable. Mild degrees of aortic insufficiency frequently progress following LVAD implant, in part related to abnormally high radial force against the closed aortic valve secondary to high pressure (pulsatile pumps) or flow (rotary pumps) entering the ascending aorta above the valve. A variety of methods to surgically treat aortic insufficiency have been employed, but a useful technique is to fix the midpoints of the aortic leaflets together with one or more pledgeted sutures.B12

# Myocardial Recovery

The potential for myocardial recovery days, months, or even years after MCSD implant is the ideal goal of any implant that does not result in cardiac replacement. Although sufficient myocardial recovery to allow successful device explant is the desired goal, successful explant of durable long-term devices has to date been uncommon.

Extensive studies have characterized the histologic and molecular changes of chronic myocardial damage sufficient to produce terminal heart failure. Myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis, and decreased contractile function define the phenomenon of *cardiac remodeling* and characterize the failing myocardium.B3,M2,Z1 The cellular markers of cardiac remodeling signal myocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, and abnormal expression of specific genes that characterize the failing myocardium. These cellular and molecular abnormalities are associated with left ventricular enlargement, increase in left ventricular mass, and systolic/diastolic dysfunction. Increases in collagen content are associated with diastolic dysfunction.B10,K9

In the presence of prolonged cardiac unloading with an LVAD, myocyte size and myocardial collagen content and collagen production (fibrosis) generally decline.B1,B3,B11

Expression of proinflammatory cytokines—particularly tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), IL-6, and IL-8—is associated with cardiac enlargement and heart failure.F2 Chronic ventricular unloading with an LVAD is associated with a reduction in expression of these cytokines.B6,G2,M3,T2,U1 Thus, reversal of the proinflammatory state of the failing myocardium may play an important role in restoring more normal structure and function by interrupting the cycle of inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis.

Dystrophin is a structural protein that contributes to normal contractility, likely through support of the cardiomyocyte membrane.M5,M7,O1,T3 In the failing heart, abnormal dystrophin activity can be partially normalized with chronic VAD therapy.V1

On an anatomic and functional level, chronic LVAD support generally results in reduction in left ventricular mass as well as left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volume.T1 Frequently there is improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction.

Available evidence suggests that in the present of chronic cardiomyopathy, prolonged unloading with an LVAD frequently induces recovery of cellular and molecular markers of cardiac remodeling, occasionally produces improvement in ejection fraction and other hemodynamic and structural parameters, yet rarely restores sufficient function to allow successful LVAD removal.

Considerable experience is accumulating with surviving patients suffering from chronic heart failure who have undergone device removal for myocardial improvement/ recovery,B4,D1,K3 with reported 5-year survival as high as 78%.D1,M6 It remains to be determined whether specific device type (pulsatile vs. continuous flow), pumping strategy (complete vs. incomplete unloading), or the addition of specific pharmacologic therapies during support (e.g., the β-agonist clenbuterolB4) will increase the likelihood of sufficient recovery for successful explantation.

The expectation for recovery in the setting of *acute* heart failure due to recent-onset nonischemic cardiomyopathy or acute myocarditis is much more favorable.F1,M4 Even among patients with acute myocarditis who present in cardiogenic shock and require emergent mechanical support, the natural history is usually one of progressive improvement. Such patients should be managed with the expectation that recovery and explantation will be likely, rather than proceeding with early cardiac transplantation.

## Mechanical Circulatory Support as Permanent Therapy for Advanced Heart Failure

and multiple ongoing clinical trials of continuous flow pumps as DT in the United States, the application of permanent MCS is evolving toward a larger population of advanced heart failure patients. Currently, permanent therapy is reserved for patients with refractory or recurrent class IV heart failure who are ineligible for heart transplantation.W2

The NHLBI-sponsored INTERMACS database has categorized subsets of class IV heart failure to better reflect current indications for device therapy. The distribution of DT patients by INTERMACS level is depicted in Table 22-5. K8

With the demonstration of improved survival (see Fig. 22-29) and device durability (see Table 22-4) with continuous flow pumps, greater application of MCS as long-term therapy for advanced heart failure is expected. Specific guidelines for application of device therapy for transplant-ineligible patients in INTERMACS levels 1 to 6 (subsets of NYHA class IV) await further prospective studies.

# PEDIATRIC CIRCULATORY SUPPORT

Limitations in access to cardiac transplantation for infants and children with advanced heart failure has provided a potent stimulus for development of MCS systems suitable for small patients. During the past decade, application to small children of pumps designed for adults has generated poor survival.

A multi-institutional analysis by Blume and colleaguesB7 examined the use of MCS in pediatric patients in the decade from 1993 to 2003. Although mortality during MCS support progressively decreased during the decade (8% mortality prior to transplant after 2000), the inadequacy of mechanical support systems for smaller patients is apparent by stratifying outcome according to age at implant (Fig. 22-30). Mortality during support in patients younger than 10 years of age (and especially in small children and infants) exceeded 60%. During this era, support for infants and small children was basically limited to extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO) support.

## Paracorporeal Support

Although the Thoratec paracorporeal PVAD is primarily designed for adults, it has been widely applied to the pediatric age group. Pediatric and adolescent PVAD support has

![](_page_21_Figure_15.jpeg)

**Figure 22-30** Survival after ventricular assist implantation, stratified by age. Pediatric Heart Transplant Study, 1993-2003. (Redrawn from Kirklin.K5)

been reported in over 150 patients.H2 Approximately 50% of the patients have required biventricular support, with the vast majority of patients suffering from cardiomyopathy or acute myocarditis. The major adverse events with this device in the pediatric population are thromboembolism and hemorrhage, which were more common than among adult patients. The higher incidence of thromboembolic neurologic complications in older children and small adolescents with this device likely relates to the low pump rate (and resultant increase in stasis) when the 65-mL pump is applied to smaller patients.

Reproducible effective bridging of infants and children to transplantation requires availability of a variety of pump sizes suitable for the anticipated cardiac output. Paracorporeal volume displacement pumps are particularly prone to thrombus formation when either pump speed is low (≤50 beats per minute) or when there is consistent incomplete filling of the blood chamber.

To address the challenge of providing mechanical support in small patients, the Berlin Heart EXCOR (Berlin, Germany) was developed to include multiple pump sizes. The Berlin Heart EXCOR is a paracorporeal system with an electropneumatic drive system. Pediatric blood pumps are available in

![](_page_22_Picture_2.jpeg)

sizes of 10, 25, and 30 mL as well as larger sizes (50, 60, and 80 mL) for adolescents. A variety of inflow and outflow cannula are available to support patients aged from neonate through adult (Fig. 22-31). The device can be employed for isolated left ventricular support, right ventricular support, or biventricular assistance.

The pump contains polyurethane trileaflet inflow and outflow valves. Of importance, the blood chambers and polyurethane ports are transparent, allowing direct visualization for detection of thrombus formation. When thrombus is detected (Fig. 22-32), pump exchange can be accomplished at the bedside.

Selection of pump size is of special importance; an undersized pump may inadequately decompress the ventricle and provide inadequate cardiac output, whereas an oversized pump is more likely to generate pump thrombus secondary to inadequate filling and low pump rates. In general, a 10-mL pump is selected for infants up to about 9 kg, a 25 or 30-mL pump between 10 and 25 kg, and a 50-mL pump for children and adolescents over about 30 kg. In selecting pump size for infants between about 8 and 12 kg, it is important to remember that the 10-mL pump will produce a maximum flow of 1 to 1.2 L/min. If calculated/desired cardiac output exceeds this value, the 10-mL pump may inadequately decompresses the left ventricle, with resultant

important elevation of left atrial (and potentially pulmonary arterial) pressure.

## *Anticoagulation*

Following implantation of the Berlin Heart standard administration of clotting factors can be employed to achieve hemostasis, with the exception that platelet transfusion should be avoided when possible because of the associated risk of sensitization and subsequent development of anti-HLA antibodies that could affect donor matching. When bleeding and chest tube drainage are minimal, initiation of heparin infusion is recommended, although some protocols avoid heparin altogether. Warfarin therapy is guided by INR (2.5-3.5). Some centers substitute chronic heparin therapy for warfarin in small infants. ASA and dipyridamole (or clopidogrel) are initiated within the first few days. Twice-weekly monitoring with thromboelastography is recommended to assess overall anticoagulation effectiveness, and specific testing of platelet function is advisable to determine adequacy of blockade of the arachidonic acid pathway (by ASA) and the ADP pathway (by clopidogrel).

#### *Neurologic Events*

Intracerebral hemorrhage and thromboembolic episodes are the major causes of morbidity and mortality during pump support. Specific time-related risk of these events is not precisely documented, but the incidence of serious neurologic events during support is estimated at 7% to 8%.K5

#### *EXCOR Pediatric Experience*

The German Heart Institute reported an experience of 68 pediatric patients supported between 1992 and 2005.K5

**Figure 22-33** The MicroMed-DeBakey Child. (Courtesy MicroMed Technology Inc., Houston, Tex.; used with permission.G3)

Since 1999, approximately 60% of patients received isolated left ventricular support, with about 40% requiring biventricular implants. The maximum duration of support was 420 days, with 73% of patients surviving to transplantation or recovery with device explantation. Major causes of mortality were multi-organ failure, sepsis, stroke, and hemorrhage. In North America, 80 patients were supported between 2000 and 2007, with the smallest patient being 3.0 kg and 15 days of age. The longest support was 234 days, with 55% of patients undergoing cardiac transplantation, 13% weaned from the device for recovery, and 25% mortality during device support. The Berlin EXCOR is currently approved for clinical use in Europe and the United States.

# MicroMed-DeBakey VAD Child

The MicroMed-DeBakey VAD Child is a pediatric axial flow pump of the same basic design as the adult MicroMed pump (see "Continuous Flow Ventricular Assist Devices" under Durable Circulatory Support Devices). Basic design differences include a shorter inflow apical cannula (2.5 cm), an inflow tube angle of 140 degrees, and a shorter outflow protector sleeve (2.6 inches). These design alterations allow the pump to lie at a more acute angle with less lateral space required in the child or adolescent (Fig. 22-33). Current accepted criteria for this pediatric axial flow pump include (1) bridge-to-transplant therapy, (2) patients aged 6 to 16 years, (3) refractory NYHA class IV symptoms with inotrope requirement, and (4) BSA of at least 0.7 m2 .

# Emerging Devices

With the clear need for more effective miniaturized systems for technical circulatory support in infants and small children, the NHLBI has funded research for the development of five unique pediatric pumps: two magnetically suspended continuous flow pumps, an axial-flow apically implanted device, a pulsatile flow device, and a compact integrated pediatric cardiopulmonary assist system (Fig. 22-34). None of these devices has currently entered clinical trials.
