### **Section I Mitral Valve Disease**

#### DEFINITION

This chapter describes surgical aspects of acquired mitral valve disease, excluding ischemic mitral regurgitation (see Chapter 10). Associated or secondary tricuspid valve disease is also considered (see Section II of this chapter and Chapter 14), as is concomitant coronary artery surgery in patients with nonischemic mitral valve disease (see Section III of this chapter).

#### HISTORICAL NOTE

#### Mitral Stenosis

Sir Lauder Brunton was among the first to consider surgical treatment of mitral stenosis in his "preliminary note" in *The Lancet* in 1902.B44 Cutler, then at Western Reserve University Medical School in Cleveland and later the Mosley Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School and Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, did experimental work on surgical approaches to mitral stenosis. In 1923, he and Levine reported an operation via median sternotomy in which a special curved knife was inserted through the left ventricular (LV) apex to cut a stenotic mitral valve.C41 In 1925, Souttar digitally opened a stenotic mitral valve through the left atrial appendage.S28

An effective closed surgical approach to mitral stenosis began with Harken and colleagues and Bailey in the United States and Brock and colleagues in London.B2,B5,H8 Harken had been doing animal experiments involving mitral valve surgery at the Boston City Hospital in 1939 before serving with the United States Army in World War II, during which time he became well known for successful removal of missiles and shell fragments from the heart. After the war he continued his work on mitral valve surgery at the Boston City and Peter Bent Brigham Hospitals. Bailey was working primarily at Hahnemann Hospital in Philadelphia. Although their techniques and terminology were somewhat different, their approaches to opening the valve through the left atrial appendage were similar. Technical modifications subsequently added to *closed commissurotomy* included Tubb's transventricular dilator, used with digital control by a finger inserted through the left atrial appendage. A23

In 1955, surgeons began to think of opening stenosed mitral valves by intracardiac techniques on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). However, closed heart operations produced such generally good results that the open heart technique did not come into wide use until after 1970.

#### Mitral Regurgitation

Although a few ingenious *closed* methods of surgically improving mitral regurgitation were reported during the 1950s, particularly by Bailey, Davila, Nichols, and their colleagues, <sup>B3,D11,N9</sup> an effective *open* approach using CPB was not made until 1957 by Lillehei and colleagues<sup>L11</sup> and Merendino and Bruce. M19 McGoon described an effective repair for mitral regurgitation due to ruptured chordae in 1960. M15 In subsequent years, a number of surgeons have contributed technical advances in the repair of mitral regurgitation, particularly Carpentier, Duran, Frater, Reed, and their colleagues. C11,D26,F7,R13

#### Mitral Valve Replacement

A number of surgeons realized very early the need for replacing at least some diseased mitral valves. However, it was Starr and Edwards from the University of Oregon Medical Center who, in 1961, first reported successful mitral valve replacement using a mechanical prosthesis. S32

Although the Starr-Edwards valve became the "gold standard" in prosthetic valves for most of the next decade, it soon became apparent that aggressive anticoagulation was necessary to control the marked thromboembolic tendency. Valve design focus subsequently was redirected toward lowerprofile valves with novel occluder designs. The Bjork-Shiley prosthesis, designed by cardiac surgeon Viking Bjork of Sweden and Earl Shiley in California, B20,B44 was the first successful tilting disc valve. It emerged as the leading prosthesis in the 1970s. It was first marketed in 1971 with a carbon-coated disc and both inflow and outflow struts welded to the chromium alloy orifice. The hemodynamics and freedom from hemolysis were superior, but strict anticoagulation was required to prevent valve thrombosis. When a later design change (convexo-concave disc)<sup>Y4</sup> was associated with strut fracture, <sup>11</sup> the valve was eventually taken off the market. <sup>B27,C24,H16</sup> Enduring bileaflet valves would await the application of pyrolytic carbon technology from the space industry in about 1977. The bileaflet St. Jude Medical valve developed in the late 1970s became the dominant prosthetic valve of the 1980s, E10,E11 offering further improvement in hemodynamics, less blood stagnation, greater opening of the leaflets, and a lower risk of thromboembolism. <sup>C21,C42</sup>

Biological or tissue prosthetic valves had been in development since the 1950s, and in the 1960s formalin fixation was introduced to sterilize and fix heterograft tissue. <sup>C6</sup> When investigators became aware of the tendency of formalin fixation to induce collagen breakdown in valve cusps—with resultant fibrosis, calcification, and degeneration—tissue fixation of porcine valves with glutaraldehyde rapidly became the standard. The first commercially available bioprosthetic valves were developed by Hancock in the United States (1970) and Carpentier in Paris. <sup>C4,C7,K2</sup>

#### **MORPHOLOGY**

Anatomy of the mitral valve is discussed in detail in Chapter 1. Several features are of particular importance in considering valve pathology and reparative techniques. The anterior leaflet is conveniently divided into three sectors: A<sub>1</sub> laterally, A<sub>2</sub> centrally, and A<sub>3</sub> medially. The posterior leaflet is also divided into three sectors: P<sub>1</sub> laterally, P<sub>2</sub> centrally, and P<sub>3</sub> medially<sup>1,2</sup> (Fig. 11-1). When the cause of regurgitation is *prolapse of the posterior leaflet*, sectors P<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>3</sub> are usually involved. Additionally, there is usually some degree of anular dilatation.

The right fibrous trigone is adjacent to the posteromedial commissure and is part of the central fibrous body located at the intersection of the membranous septum, mitral and tricuspid anulus, and aortic anulus (Fig. 11-2). The left fibrous trigone is located near the aortic anulus under the left aortic cusp and adjacent to the anterolateral commissure. The posteromedial and anterolateral papillary muscles give rise to chordae tendinae going to both leaflets. The chords are generally categorized into three groups: first-order chordae originate near tips of the papillary muscles and insert on the free edge of the leaflets. These chordae prevent valve edge prolapse during systole and, when elongated or ruptured, produce mitral regurgitation. Second-order chordae (including two or more longer strut chordae) insert on the ventricular surface of the leaflets at the junction of the rough zone (closer to the free edge) and clear zone, which is demarcated by a ridge that corresponds to the line of leaflet coaptation. Third-order chordae originate from the underlying ventricular wall and insert on the posterior leaflet near the anulus. In addition, distinct commissural chordae exist at the commissures.

#### Mitral Stenosis

Acquired mitral stenosis usually results from rheumatic heart disease, as does mixed stenosis and regurgitation. It occurs as an isolated valvar condition in 40% of patients with rheumatic heart disease. W9

Commissural fusion and leaflet thickening are the dominant features in clinically important mitral stenosis. The characteristic fusion of the edges of the mitral leaflets in

Corresponding sectors of posterior leaflet are  $P_1$ ,  $P_2$ , and  $P_3$ . (From Quill and colleagues.<sup>Q1</sup>)

commissural areas is a complex process involving coapting edges of commissural, posterior (mural), and anterior (septal) leaflets at both the anterolateral and posteromedial commissures. Valve leaflets are thickened to varying degrees, particularly at their free edges and sites of fusion. Calcification often occurs in older patients, beginning at the commissures but at times extending posteriorly into the anulus.

Chordae tendineae are variably involved by the rheumatic process. Occasionally, in the presence of severe mitral stenosis, the chordae are nearly normal in appearance, and opening the valve commissures results in a wide orifice. More often, some degree of chordal thickening, fusion, and shortening is present in each commissural area. This process is extreme in some patients, particularly those in whom restenosis develops after an earlier commissurotomy, and results in an obstructing, tough, subcommissural mass on both sides of the narrow orifice. This advanced pathology may be purely rheumatic in origin or may partly result from hemodynamic and (in the case of restenosis) surgical trauma. Subcommissural pathology may render the mitral apparatus severely stenotic, even after commissurotomy. Rarely, mucopolysaccharidosis or severe anular calcification may cause pure mitral stenosis.

The *left atrium* is enlarged in pure mitral stenosis but usually not severely, and its wall is thickened. *LV* volume and mass are normal or slightly reduced. When fibrosis and particularly calcification involve the mitral anulus, regional wall motion at the LV base is impaired, but overall LV systolic and diastolic function are often normal. The the disease, however, LV function may be impaired.

Pulmonary vascular resistance (Rp) may increase in patients with severe mitral stenosis. This increase may be the result of spasm in the pulmonary arterioles, presumably a reflex from

left atrial hypertension. Organic pulmonary vascular disease may also increase Rp and is often found in young Polynesian and Asian patients, as well as in a small proportion of other patients with long-standing mitral stenosis. Rarely, the vascular disease may progress to obliteration of pulmonary arterioles. Increased Rp produces a rise in pulmonary artery and right ventricular pressure out of proportion to the valve stenosis and left atrial pressure increase, which leads to right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy and secondary tricuspid regurgitation.

#### Mitral Stenosis and Regurgitation

Mixed mitral stenosis and regurgitation is primarily rheumatic in origin. Stenosis is produced by varying degrees of commissural fusion and chordal thickening. Regurgitation results from fibrous retraction of the central unfused portion of the leaflets and either chordal shortening or chordal elongation. Shortening restricts leaflet motion and increases the gaping central orifice, whereas elongation permits cusp prolapse. Occasionally, chordae rupture as a result of the rheumatic process.

Endocarditis on a rheumatic stenotic valve adds regurgitation by eroding leaflet or chordal tissue.

#### Mitral Regurgitation

Regurgitation may be due to rheumatic valve disease, but has numerous other causes and morphologic patterns.

#### Rheumatic Mitral Regurgitation

Mitral regurgitation may occur as a severe lesion (sometimes combined with aortic regurgitation) during the acute rheumatic process in association with extensive myocarditis and sometimes pericarditis and pancarditis. Anular dilatation is the primary cause of regurgitation in this circumstance, with the valve leaflets frequently showing edema only and virtually normal chordae. After remission of the acute process, regurgitation may spontaneously regress, presumably because the myocarditis heals, the heart becomes smaller, and anular dilatation regresses. In most cases, however, there is progressive leaflet thickening, particularly of the posterior leaflet, which becomes retracted and rolled with shortening of chordae. The anterior leaflet is less thickened, and major chordae are frequently elongated, allowing leaflet prolapse. The posterior chordae may also elongate, and occasionally one or more may rupture. Commissural leaflets are obliterated and fused, but the commissures remain more or less open. Calcification is uncommon. Anular dilatation is almost invariably progressive and produces increasing regurgitation.

#### Mitral Valve Prolapse

Mitral valve prolapse is a billowing of one or both leaflets into the left atrium during ventricular systole, with or without mitral regurgitation. Prolapse of a mitral valve leaflet occurring as an isolated abnormality is a relatively common and complex entity, <sup>F9,J4</sup> occurring in 1% to 2.5% of the population. <sup>F8</sup> Familial mitral valve prolapse is inherited as an autosomal trait. <sup>S18</sup> Primary mitral valve prolapse occurs with

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>1</sup>Variously termed myxomatous mitral valve prolapse, myxomatous mitral valve degeneration, floppy valve, "the symptom complex of midsystolic click and late systolic murmur," and Barlow syndrome. B5

increased frequency in patients with Marfan syndrome and certain other connective tissue disorders.L15

Our understanding of the anatomic details of prolapsing anterior and posterior leaflet components has been enhanced by the classification of CarpentierC5,C7,K21 and others. In a pathologic study, Quill and colleagues identified abnormal ("deviant") clefts in all valve segments, but most commonly in the P2 region.Q1 Such abnormal clefts may contribute to mitral regurgitation observed in degenerative mitral valve disease.

Infrequently, in its severe form, mitral prolapse results in important mitral regurgitation (10% of patientsM25). Nonetheless, in the United States mitral valve prolapse has been reported as the most common cause of surgically treated isolated mitral regurgitation.R20 The basic pathologic conditions are *mitral leaflet redundancy* and *myxomatous leaflet thickening*, resulting at least partly from myxomatous proliferation of the acid mucopolysaccharide within the spongiosa, which replaces collagen in the leaflets. The redundant and elongated leaflets no longer meet properly to support each other during systole, and they begin to overshoot into the left atrium. Not only is the valve thereby rendered regurgitant, but abnormal strain is placed on the chordae as well. The chordae elongate, and ultimately some rupture, producing more regurgitation. These histologic changes and severe valve redundancy are especially pronounced in younger patients with Barlow syndrome. Older patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation are more likely to have fibroelastic deficiency and less redundant valve tissue. These differences have important surgical implications because marked leaflet redundancy with more severe myxomatous changes requires more extensive reconstructive techniques. Calcifications may occur in the mitral anulus, but do not appear to contribute to mitral valve dysfunction.B47

#### *"Idiopathic" Chordal Rupture*

"Idiopathic" and more or less localized chordal rupture is usually a variant of mitral valve prolapse syndrome,J4 in which a considerable portion of leaflet tissue is uninvolved by the myxomatous process. In most cases, the posteromedial portion of the posterior leaflet is involved; after chordal rupture, this becomes redundant and flail. More extensive posterior chordal rupture sometimes occurs. Localized chordal rupture may also occur in patients with Marfan syndrome.

#### *Mitral Anular Calcification*

Mitral anular calcification may occur in older patients without evident disease of the leaflets or chordae, but it may be more common in patients with myxomatous degeneration and prolapse of the mitral leaflets.K17,N6,S7 Anular calcification is probably a degenerative disease, more common in elderly patients and apparently more common in women.R20 It is also seen in patients with LV hypertrophy, particularly those with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM; see Chapter 19). The process involves the posterior or mural portion of the anulus more often than other portions. Degenerative anular calcification often extends into the adjacent ventricular myocardium, and it may secondarily produce mitral regurgitation or stenosis by displacing or immobilizing the mitral leaflets. Anular calcification considerably complicates mitral repair or replacement.C1,C14

#### *Ischemic Papillary Muscle Dysfunction or Rupture*

Papillary muscle dysfunction or rupture resulting from myocardial infarction or ischemic fibrosis can produce severe mitral regurgitation (see Chapter 10).

#### *Infective Endocarditis*

Endocarditis is a relatively uncommon cause of pure mitral regurgitation compared with its etiologic frequency in aortic regurgitation. When the aortic valve is infected and regurgitant, vegetations may drop down onto and infect the central portion of the anterior mitral leaflet, producing perforation and mitral regurgitation. In the absence of aortic valve disease, a normal or abnormal mitral valve may become infected,B45 with destruction of cusps, chordae, or both (see Chapter 15).

#### *Submitral Left Ventricular Aneurysms*

Submitral LV aneurysms frequently result in mitral regurgitation. This unusual type of aneurysm is not ischemic in origin and occurs most often among the southern and western African black population.A18 It may be multiloculated and have a well-defined neck situated immediately beneath the posterior mitral leaflet. Mitral regurgitation often coexists because of aneurysmal distortion of the posterior leaflet and leaflet prolapse. In rare instances, the aneurysm bulges into the left atrium from behind, partly obstructing the mitral orifice.

#### CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

#### Mitral Stenosis

The normal mitral valve orifice area in an adult is 4.0 to 5.0 cm2 . Most symptomatic patients have a mitral valve area less than 2.5 cm2 . G23 The diastolic transmitral gradient is the fundamental physiologic expression of mitral stenosis. At any given orifice size, the transmitral gradient is a function of the square of the transvalvar flow rate and diastolic filling time. Thus, for example, doubling the flow rate quadruples the transvalvar gradient. This explains the importance of exertion or other causes of increased cardiac output in development of dyspnea (induced by increased left atrial and pulmonary venous pressure) during the initial stages of mitral stenosis. As heart rate increases, during atrial fibrillation for example, diastolic filling time is greatly reduced, thereby increasing the gradient and left atrial pressure.

Effective atrial contraction during sinus rhythm has a major lessening effect on dyspnea with severe mitral stenosis, because the left atrial pressure is lower than during atrial fibrillation, and the loss of atrial contribution during atrial fibrillation results in about a 20% reduction in cardiac output.

Although the clinical condition of mitral stenosis is a continuum without discrete hemodynamic abnormalities corresponding to functional state, the following hemodynamic guidelines are useful in defining severity of mitral stenosisB31:

- Mild: valve area 1.5 to 3.5 cm2 and mean diastolic gradient less than 5 mmHg
- Moderate: valve area 1.0 to 1.5 cm2 and mean diastolic gradient 5 to 10 mmHg

■ Severe: valve area less than 1.0 cm2 and mean diastolic gradient greater than 10 mmHg

Patients with moderate mitral stenosis are often asymptomatic at rest or with ordinary activities, particularly until the third or early part of the fourth decade of life. With severe exertion, pulmonary edema may develop suddenly.

Patients with severe mitral stenosis and *without* important elevation of Rp ("unprotected" mitral stenosis) have easy fatigability and effort dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. As the disease progresses in duration and severity, structural changes (alveolar basement membrane thickening, increased lymphatic drainage, adaptation of neuroreceptors) may allow patients to remain functional for prolonged periods.G22,H23 When Rp rises, the alveolar bed is protected from sudden rises in capillary pressure with exertion, so pulmonary edema does not occur, and orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea disappear.W9 Hemoptysis is more common in this setting. When the reduction in mitral valve orifice size reaches severe levels, resting cardiac output becomes subnormal, which is usually accompanied by varying degrees of increased Rp (see also Morphology). The patient with advanced mitral stenosis who has low cardiac output and chronic heart failure secondary to high Rp is seldom seen today in developed countries. These patients tend to be women who have marked mitral facies, peripheral coldness, cyanosis, hepatic enlargement and pulsation, high jugular venous pressure with waves of tricuspid regurgitation, and sometimes ascites and peripheral edema.

In most patients, mitral stenosis can be diagnosed clinically based on history, physical examination, chest radiograph, and electrocardiogram (ECG). Auscultatory findings provide good evidence of mitral stenosis when they include a loud first sound, an opening snap, and the characteristic diastolic rumble with a presystolic crescendo when sinus rhythm is present. In severe stenosis the mid-diastolic murmur occupies more than half of diastole, and the opening snap is early.

In surgical candidates with important mitral stenosis, the chest radiograph typically shows some left atrial enlargement, although it is often only about grade 2 (on a scale of 1 to 6, with 6 being most severe). The left atrial appendage may or may not appear prominent along the left upper border of the cardiac silhouette. The LV is normal in size, but the RV and pulmonary trunk are usually somewhat enlarged. When Rp is elevated, the pulmonary trunk, branches, and hilar arteries are more enlarged; once tricuspid regurgitation occurs, there is considerable right atrial and RV enlargement. The lung fields also show varying degrees of pulmonary venous hypertension on the plain chest radiograph (large pulmonary veins in upper lung fields, interstitial pulmonary edema, Kerley B lines, or alveolar pulmonary edema).

The ECG is not diagnostic but often shows P-wave abnormalities characteristic of left atrial enlargement (P mitrale) or atrial fibrillation, and evidence of RV hypertrophy when pulmonary hypertension is present.

Two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography is highly reliable for diagnosing and quantifying severity of mitral stenosis. It demonstrates degree of stenosis, leaflet mobility, thickening and probable calcification, and any subvalvar obstruction. Doppler echocardiography, enhanced by color flow imaging to identify precise flow direction, is valuable for estimating severity of stenosis.K12 Currently these methods suffice for estimating mitral valve area as well as morphology and gradient across the valve. An echocardiographic grading system for mitral stenosis has been endorsed in the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines,W6 which is useful for identifying patient suitability for valvotomy (balloon catheter), surgical commissurotomy, or valve replacement (Table 11-1). Greater leaflet mobility, less subvalvular involvement, and less leaflet calcification (grade 1) increases the likelihood of successful valvotomy or commissurotomy.

Cardiac catheterization is usually unnecessary for diagnosing mitral stenosis and estimating its severity. Catheterization is necessary in patients older than about age 35 to study the coronary arteries, however, because about 25% of patients older than 40 with mitral stenosis without angina have important coronary artery disease.M11 When balloon valvotomy is used, prevalvotomy and postvalvotomy measurements are easily made by classic catheterization techniques or by echocardiography. *Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure* (PPCW) is measured to determine severity of pulmonary venous hypertension. PPCW (which is similar to left atrial pressure) is compared with directly measured LV diastolic pressure to determine transmitral gradient; a resting end-diastolic gradient of 10 mmHg or more indicates important mitral stenosis. Mitral valve area is calculated from Gorlin's modified orifice equation.C26

In a patient coming to treatment for mitral stenosis, the possibility of left atrial myxoma must always be considered. Echocardiography can detect a left atrial myxomaN4 and is the type of screening performed when further information is needed (see Section I, Myxoma, in Chapter 18).

#### Mitral Regurgitation

#### *Chronic*

Patients with mitral regurgitation are often asymptomatic for many years, during which time LV size may steadily increase and LV contractility decrease. Eventually, effort intolerance develops, and symptoms of pulmonary venous hypertension evolve. Fluid retention and chronic heart failure, occasionally with cardiac cachexia, are characteristic of the late stage of the disease; by then, secondary tricuspid regurgitation is usually evident.

As with mitral stenosis, important mitral regurgitation can usually be diagnosed based on history, physical examination, chest radiograph, and ECG. The classic *apical systolic murmur* of mitral regurgitation is pansystolic, loudest at the apex, and radiates to the left axilla and left lung base. Classical auscultatory findings in mitral valve regurgitation from prolapse include one or more midsystolic clicks and a late or holosystolic murmur of mitral regurgitation. When regurgitation is the result primarily of ruptured chordae and prolapse of the posterior leaflet, however, the regurgitant jet is directed toward the roof (superior aspect) of the left atrium and is transmitted to the aortic root. Therefore, the murmur is maximal in the parasternal aortic area and may radiate into the carotid arteries. In contrast to the anterior radiation of posterior leaflet prolapse, the murmur of anterior prolapse radiates posteriorly to the infrascapular and posterior cervical area.G18 As a result of large and rapid mitral valve flow during diastole, an LV filling sound (S3) and a diastolic rumble may be present. Two important signs of the severity of regurgitation are an overactive LV impulse at the apex (from LV enlargement) and a precordial lift, the latter the result of systolic pulsation in the enlarged left atrium and right ventricle. There is no correlation between intensity of the murmur and severity of mitral regurgitation, but a true holosystolic murmur is indicative of more severe regurgitation.A16,B8

In severe chronic mitral regurgitation, the chest radiograph usually is highly characteristic. The left atrium generally is more enlarged than in patients with mitral stenosis, and the left atrial appendage is usually prominent. The LV may be enlarged, and there may be varying degrees of right atrial enlargement, depending on the amount of associated tricuspid regurgitation.

The ECG may remain normal even in the presence of severe mitral regurgitation. However, a pattern of LV hypertrophy is common.

As with mitral stenosis, 2D echocardiography demonstrates the details of leaflet pathology. Both transthoracic (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) are useful. Echocardiographic diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse requires prolapse of 2 mm or more above the anulus in the long-axis parasternal view.F8 Leaflet thickness of 5 mm or more increases the likelihood of mitral valve prolapse. Prolapse of a specific leaflet can be visualized, and Doppler color flow imaging can identify the location and magnitude of the mitral regurgitant flow. Echocardiography may also be used to estimate both the degree of LV enlargement and, by quantification of shortening fraction, ventricular contractility. Newer echocardiographic methods using 3D techniques offer precise and accurate evaluation of leaflet physiology and specific areas of regurgitation within the valve apparatus. The *effective regurgitant area* and *regurgitant volume* can be measured echocardiographically and have been identified as predictors of outcome following mitral valve repair (see Indications for Operation later in this section)*.* The American Society of Echocardiography has recommended grading mitral regurgitation as mild, moderate, and severe (grades 1-3). For refinement of intermediate levels, the terms *mild to moderate* and *moderate to severe* can be used.Z2

Left ventriculography also demonstrates the regurgitant process at the mitral valve and can show leaflet prolapse. Degree of regurgitation can usually be estimated with reasonable accuracy, although if left atrial or LV enlargement is severe, the estimate is less valid. Fairly accurate calculations of regurgitant flow can be made from measurements of LV stroke volume by quantitative left ventriculography, and of forward flow by some measurement of cardiac output.R3 LV ejection fraction (EF) can also be calculated by quantitative cineangiography or radioisotope techniques. Decisions about treatment of patients with mitral regurgitation may require additional studies from which inferences can be made about LV contractility (see "Mitral Regurgitation" under Natural History later in this section).

#### *Acute*

Mitral regurgitation may develop acutely as a result of chordal rupture or infective endocarditis or may complicate the course of acute myocardial infarction (see Chapter 10). Symptoms and signs of severe pulmonary venous hypertension suddenly appear. The left atrium and LV are normal in size or only slightly enlarged. The chest radiograph is dominated by signs of pulmonary venous hypertension, and left atrial pressure is high, as is the *v* wave. A mitral regurgitation murmur is often midsystolic and higher pitched compared with the pansystolic murmur of chronic mitral regurgitation.

#### NATURAL HISTORY

#### Mitral Stenosis

Rheumatic mitral stenosis develops slowly after initial rheumatic involvement of the valve. In the New England area of the United States, the average age of the initial attack of rheumatic fever is 12 years, average age of onset of clinical signs of mitral stenosis 20 years, and age at onset of symptoms 31 years.B28 Progression of valvar fibrosis and calcification is related in part to repeated episodes of rheumatic fever, but mechanical trauma and deposition of platelets and other blood substances resulting from stenosis-induced alterations of flow patterns also play a role.S14 This progression is a major factor in increasing symptoms, ultimately causing death.

Most patients with mitral stenosis have normal LV wall thickness, volume, and systolic and diastolic functionS10 but do not increase cardiac output under stress, such as when LV afterload is acutely reduced by infusion of sodium nitroprusside.B39 These findings suggest that the major cause of chronically reduced cardiac output in these patients is obstruction at the mitral valve.B39,H10,H21 In some patients with long-standing mitral stenosis, however, minor posterobasal

regional wall contraction abnormalities develop, perhaps from a rigid mitral valve complex.H10

In a small proportion of patients with apparently isolated mitral stenosis (usually older persons), EF is substantially reduced.B39,C40 Such patients have severe posterobasal segmental wall contraction abnormalities,H10 sometimes anterolateral segmental contraction abnormalities, and occasionally diffuse hypokinesis.B39,C40 Anterolateral segmental contraction abnormalities may be caused by papillary muscle scarring and immobilization. Diffuse hypokinesia may result from scarring and decreased LV compliance secondary to chronic low cardiac output and low coronary blood flow.

Once symptoms develop after the so-called latent period, their progression to a state of total disability (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class IV) requires an estimated 7 to 10 yearsR6,W9 (Fig. 11-3). Average age of death of patients with surgically untreated mitral stenosis is estimated to be 40 to 50 years.R6,R26

This general pattern of evolution is considerably shorter in some parts of the world and in some races. Polynesians in New Zealand, African Americans in south-central Alabama, Inuits in Alaska, and Asians experience a greatly accelerated evolution of signs, symptoms, and disability. Many reports suggest that in addition to possible genetic factors, economic underdevelopment may play a role.B34,C22,M3

Other events tend to occur during the lifetime of patients with surgically untreated mitral stenosis, and these in turn may alter the natural history of the disease. *Atrial fibrillation* usually develops, often occurring first in paroxysmal form. The first paroxysm, usually with tachycardia, may initiate symptoms because patients with mitral stenosis are particularly sensitive to loss of the atrial contribution to ventricular filling and to shortening of ventricular filling. Although originally incited by left atrial hypertension and hypertrophy, atrial fibrillation eventually becomes persistent because of disintegration of the architecture of atrial muscle.B4 Because it reduces cardiac output and elevates left atrial pressure, atrial fibrillation accelerates clinical deterioration of patients with mitral stenosis and indicates a relatively advanced stage of the disease. It is an incremental risk factor for premature death of these patients. Olesen found that in patients with atrial fibrillation, 10- and 20-year survival was 25% and 10%, respectively, whereas in patients in sinus rhythm at initial observation, survival was 46% and 29%, respectively.O4

Systemic *arterial emboli*, most of which lodge in cerebral arteries, can suddenly complicate or kill patients with mitral stenosis. Most emboli originate in the left atrial appendage or left atrium, yet often no residual thrombus remains in the heart after embolization. Hoeksema and colleagues found that only 25% of patients with a history of arterial emboli had left atrial thrombi detected at closed commissurotomy.H18 Also, some patients with large left atrial thrombi never have demonstrable embolization. Left atrial thrombosis and embolization are much more common when atrial fibrillation is present than in patients in sinus rhythm. At least 10% of surgically untreated patients develop arterial embolization during their lifetime, and a massive cerebral embolus may suddenly kill a mildly symptomatic patient.S14

*Infectious endocarditis* is unusual in patients with mitral stenosis.R26

Massive *pulmonary hemorrhage* may occasionally develop in patients otherwise mildly symptomatic from mitral stenosis. The association between mitral stenosis and hemorrhage is strongly suggested by its prompt and long-standing remission after surgical treatment of the stenosis.R4

In fact, the aforementioned features and criteria do not truly represent the "natural" (i.e., untreated) history of mitral stenosis, but rather the spectrum of mitral stenosis in *surgically untreated* patients receiving medical treatment available in the mid-20th century. The end stage of the disease in many patients is characterized by *cardiac cachexia*, a state infrequently seen before diuretic therapy became available. The true natural history of mitral stenosis in the first quarter of the 20th century must have been different from that portrayed here, with the interval between onset of symptoms and death much shorter and with different patterns of death.

Likewise, evolution of the rheumatic disease complex is different in patients with mitral stenosis treated surgically vs. medically. The course of the disease varies because the increased lifespan due to surgery now results in development of hemodynamically important rheumatic aortic valve disease and important tricuspid regurgitation in a considerably greater proportion of patients with mitral stenosis (Fig. 11-4).

#### Mitral Regurgitation

The natural history of mitral regurgitation is difficult to define because (1) etiology is variable, (2) age at onset is variable, (3) mitral regurgitation may be mild and nonprogressive for many years, and (4) LV function, an important determinant of symptoms and survival, deteriorates at different rates.

Patients with mild to moderate mitral regurgitation may remain asymptomatic for many years. Even when mitral regurgitation becomes severe, the effect of changes in global LV function is modified by the fact that total LV load resisting shortening (afterload) is abnormally low in these patients (see "Ventricular Afterload" under Cardiac Output and Its Determinants in Chapter 5). Afterload is low as a result of ejection of part of the LV stroke volume into the low-pressure

![](_page_8_Figure_2.jpeg)

left atrium; because of this, the LV becomes small, and its wall thickens very early in systole.U2 The resulting favorable relationships in the Laplace law reduce wall stress and afterload.H19 Because of this, LV contractility may gradually deteriorate while LV systolic function (EF) is maintained, the mechanism being reduction in afterload.C3 The EF may even increase during exercise under these circumstances while symptoms remain mild.P8 This compensated period of mitral regurgitation may last for years. Later, as the regurgitation becomes severe and LV contractility decreases, EF may diminish during exercise, even in asymptomatic patients.

These considerations have led to development of techniques for estimating LV function that are independent of preload and afterload.C3 Foremost among these are those that use ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relations (see "Mitral Regurgitation" under Indications for Operation, Selection of Technique, and Choice of Device later in this section and "Cardiac Output and Its Determinants" in Section I of Chapter 5).B35,G31,M18,S1

Patients with mitral regurgitation may develop tricuspid regurgitation, which also affects natural history (see Section II).

#### *Rheumatic Mitral Regurgitation*

Patients with rheumatic mitral regurgitation are more likely to have had a previous severe attack of rheumatic fever than those with mitral stenosis. The interval before the appearance of regurgitation also is shorter than for stenosis. Patients with surgically untreated but hemodynamically important rheumatic mitral regurgitation survive similarly to those with mitral stenosis.R6 Furthermore, the curve is different in different environmental and genetic situations, as it is in mitral stenosis. In San Francisco, for example, survival of such patients 5 years after initial evaluation was 80%, with 10-year survival of 60%, whereas in Venezuela, 5-year survival was only 46%.M32 Accelerated forms of rheumatic mitral regurgitation also occur in the same geographic areas where severe mitral stenosis appears in the pediatric population, with important symptoms by age 10 years.S15

#### *Mitral Valve Prolapse*

The natural history of isolated mitral valve prolapse without regurgitation is highly variable, with the majority of patients having age-adjusted survival similar to that of the general population.D15,S8 However, the major predictor of cardiac mortality is moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Mitral regurgitation associated with mitral valve prolapse has a complex natural history that entails more than leakage at the mitral valve. The mitral leaflets not only prolapse in this condition but are usually thickened as well.M6 Mitral valve regurgitation is not the only event in patients with mitral prolapse. Serious but rarely fatal arrhythmias may occur in patients with only mild regurgitation,P11 and psychiatric disturbances may develop. Symptoms may mimic thyrotoxicosis, hyperadrenergic states, or hypoglycemia.B7,B36,C39,F5 Patients often have higher than normal catecholamine levels and other evidence of high adrenergic tone.B36 As a further complication, patients with hyperthyroidism have an increased prevalence of mitral prolapse.C18

Patients with the classic form of mitral prolapse, which includes thickening of the leaflets as well as prolapse, have an increased prevalence of infective endocarditisD3,M6; those with normal leaflets (in the absence of regurgitation) do not. Both groups have a higher prevalence of stroke.M6

Severe mitral regurgitation requiring valve repair or replacement rarely develops before age 50. Thereafter, the prevalence increases steeply, particularly in men.W5 However, even men with mitral valve prolapse who have reached age 70 years have only about a 5% chance of requiring mitral valve repair or replacement. Once important mitral regurgitation appears, however, it tends to progress just as it does in patients with rheumatic mitral regurgitation. Presumably, as prolapse worsens, support in systole provided by closing of the two leaflets against each other ("stacked rifle effect") is lost. This puts an abnormally large load on the chordae, which elongate, become thick, and eventually rupture. This process worsens the regurgitation and accelerates the natural history of the disease.

In view of the increasing ability of cardiac surgeons to repair mitral regurgitation, the natural history of severe mitral regurgitation secondary to mitral valve prolapse is of considerable importance. Two Mayo Clinic studies in the mid-1990s called attention to the increased mortality in patients with chronic flail leaflets treated medically.G25,L14 A 2008 multicenter European study examined the natural history of severe regurgitation caused by one or both flail leaflets (failure of leaflet coaptation with rapid systolic movement of the involved leaflet tip in the left atrium).G26 Involvement was confined to the posterior leaflet in 314 patients (79%), anterior leaflet in 31 (8%), both in 46 (12%), and unspecified in 3 (1%). The long-term outcome with medical treatment included an important likelihood of major adverse events by 8 years, including atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and cardiovascular deathG26 (Fig. 11-5). Need for mitral valve surgery (or death from cardiovascular causes) was nearly unavoidable by 8 years after diagnosis. A subgroup analysis of *asymptomatic* patients with normal ventricular systolic function revealed a 5-year survival of 97% with medical treatment, but the combined occurrence of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, or cardiovascular death was 42% at 8 years. A Mayo Clinic analysis of asymptomatic patients with severe organic mitral regurgitation identified an effective regurgitant orifice (by echocardiography) of at least 40 mm2 as a major predictor of late mortality.E12

#### *Ruptured Chordae Tendineae*

Patients with mitral regurgitation and ruptured chordae tendineae may have a slow, insidious development of symptoms. Ruptured chordae of the anterior or posterior leaflet or both are often found at operation, and the mitral valve leaflets have the appearance of myxomatous degeneration. These patients probably represent a subgroup of individuals with mitral valve prolapse. In fact, ruptured chordae may be present in patients with prolapse without important symptoms. Grenadier and colleagues found 11 (8%) of 134 patients with mitral valve prolapse to have ruptured chordae and few or no symptoms.G24

By contrast, important mitral regurgitation produced acutely by chordal rupture may occur in patients with no previous valve leakage. This happens predominantly in middle-age men.S15 Often it is a complication in the life history of patients with midsystolic clicks and only trivial murmurs, but without previous evidence of mitral regurgitation. The anterior mitral leaflet and its chordae are frequently entirely normal, with the disease process limited to the medial aspect of the posterior mitral leaflet. In this group of patients with acute and severe symptoms, presumably initiated by sudden chordal rupture, the left atrium and LV are small, left atrial pressure is high, the *v* wave is greatly accentuated, and there is substantial clinical and radiologic evidence of pulmonary venous hypertension. TTE and TEE are diagnostic. The posteromedial segment of the valve (P2, P3) prolapses, and the ruptured chordae are flail or seen as thickened stubs on the affected portion of the leaflet. If the patient survives the acute event, the LV and left atrium enlarge moderately over time, and symptoms may lessen with appropriate medical management (as has been shown experimentally as wellT2). The patient gradually regains a feeling of well-being. One year later, left atrial and ventricular enlargement may not have progressed, the LV and left atrium seemingly adapting to the volume overload. Years may pass before the self-aggravating tendency of mitral regurgitation results in increased regurgitation volume. After this, the classic natural history of important mitral regurgitation evolves.

In other patients with severe acute manifestations, symptoms improve only mildly with intense medical treatment. Although most patients survive, LV and left atrial enlargement progress steadily in the months after onset. Such patients have a large mitral regurgitant flow. When untreated surgically, they progress through the life history of severe mitral regurgitation more rapidly than most patients; without surgical intervention, they die within 2 to 5 years.

#### *Infective Endocarditis*

Infective endocarditis on a previously mildly abnormal mitral valve may produce acute mitral regurgitation. The natural history of that condition is similar to that described for acute chordal rupture, except that early mortality is higher. Infrequently, death is related to uncontrolled infection. Infective endocarditis is discussed in detail in Chapter 15.

#### TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

Tricuspid valve regurgitation may be associated with any type of mitral valve disease. Consequently, tricuspid anuloplasty or rarely replacement may have to be performed concomitantly with mitral valve surgery. Techniques for these operations are described in Chapter 14.

#### Closed Mitral Commissurotomy

After the usual preparations, including placing an arterial catheter in the right radial artery, the patient is positioned in the right lateral decubitus position. The hips are rotated to the patient's left. The left arm is placed at the patient's side and hanging slightly over the edge of a well-padded portion of the operating table, with the left hand beneath the hips. This position permits good access to the operative area.

After appropriate skin preparation and patient draping, an anterolateral incision is made over the interspace, through which the impulse of the apex of the LV can be palpated. The incision in the interspace (typically the fifth or sixth) is carried posteriorly, but the latissimus dorsi usually does not require incision. At times, the costal cartilage above or below the incision is transected.

The pericardium is opened anterior to the phrenic nerve. A purse-string suture is placed just off, and usually just lateral and superior to, the LV apex. The purse string is threaded into a Rummel tourniquet or similar device. A similar pursestring suture is placed around the tip of the left atrial appendage. With both the assistant and surgeon grasping their own side of the appendage with a sturdy thumb (tissue) forceps, an incision is made just off its tip. The incision must be of a size to accommodate the surgeon's right index finger snugly. While bleeding is controlled by opposing the thumb forceps, blood is allowed to escape for two or three brief periods so that small clots may emerge. The surgeon's right index finger is then insinuated through the appendage into the left atrium and passed directly to the mitral valve. After the valve is evaluated, pressure is applied with the exploring finger against the anterolateral commissure. Occasionally, this maneuver opens a pliable but severely stenotic valve widely and essentially completely, with no further action needed. In most cases, however, a Tubbs dilator is required and is inserted through a small stab wound in the center of the LV apical purse string (Fig. 11-6, *A*).

An assistant gently secures the Rummel tourniquet that has engaged the apical purse-string suture. Guided by the intraatrial finger and with the setscrew on the dilator

Key: *LV,* Left ventricle. (From Ellis.E7)

positioned so that the maximal opening is 2.5 cm, the dilator is passed through the valve. The dilator blades are opened moderately for a few seconds to ensure that each dilating blade is against a leaflet and not a commissure (see Fig. 11-3, *B*). This and each successive dilatation last only 5 to 6 seconds, and the heart is allowed to recover completely between dilatations. Successive dilatations are then performed, first with the maximum opening set at 2.5 cm and then at about 2.9, 3.3, 3.7, and finally 4.0 cm. In small patients, the maximum dilator setting should be 3.3 to 3.5 cm. If important regurgitation develops after a dilatation, no larger settings should be attempted. Again, after the heart has recovered, the index finger is withdrawn as an assistant places a side-biting clamp across the lips of the incision in the appendage. At times, two Allis-Adair forceps close the incision well, and the clamp is not necessary. The purse string around the entrance of the Tubbs dilator is loosened slightly and then secured as the dilator is removed. No effort is made to tighten the purse string so that *all* bleeding stops, lest the purse string cut through the ventricular muscle. Digital control suffices for residual bleeding. Several full-thickness interrupted stitches are placed in the stab wound, and the purse-string suture is removed from the tourniquet and tied snugly but not tightly. The incision in the atrial appendage is closed with a few interrupted stitches. Usually the purse string on the appendage is removed rather than tied because of the risk of dislodging a small thrombus that may have formed. A large (2-cm) window is made in the pericardium posteriorly, behind the phrenic nerve, for drainage into the left pleural space. The pericardium is then closed with widely spaced interrupted sutures. A catheter is placed posterolaterally in the left pleural space, hemostasis is secured, and the incision is closed in layers.

#### Open Mitral Commissurotomy

After the usual preparations and median sternotomy, pericardial stay sutures are placed and a left atrial catheter inserted (see "Preparation for Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2). Using intraoperative TEE, chamber size is evaluated and mitral valve pathology confirmed, including degree of valve narrowing and any regurgitant jets. Often, subvalvar stenosis can be identified. Important tricuspid regurgitation or stenosis is noted.

The aortic cannula is inserted and venous cannulation accomplished with a single venous cannula, or bicaval cannulation may be used when the left atrium is small and exposure difficult. CPB is established and perfusate temperature lowered to 18°C to 20°C. A stab wound (part of the later left atriotomy) is made at the base of the right superior pulmonary vein for initial left atrial venting. A cardioplegic needle or aortic root catheter is placed in the ascending aorta, and a retrograde coronary sinus cardioplegic cannula may be introduced as well (see "Technique of Retrograde Infusion" in Chapter 3). The aorta is clamped, cold cardioplegic solution infused, and perfusate temperature stabilized at 28°C to 32°C. The left atrium is opened vertically from the right side (Fig. 11-7, *A*). This may be done after developing the interatrial groove in cases of minimal left atrial enlargement, or the incision may be started medially on the right superior pulmonary vein without dissecting the groove. Superiorly, the incision is extended beneath the superior vena cava after the right pulmonary artery is dissected away from the superior aspect of the left atrium. Inferiorly, the incision may be extended by cutting behind the freed vena caval–right atrial junction. Rarely, when exposure remains poor because of the small size of the left atrium, the superior vena cava is transected on the atrial side of the cannulation site and the incision carried farther to the superior aspect of the left atrium.B9 A Cooley left atrial retractor or Deaver retractor is inserted (Fig. 11-7, *B*). An intracardiac sump sucker placed through the incision is positioned in the orifice of one of the left pulmonary veins to keep the operative field dry.

The mitral valve is examined to determine its suitability for commissurotomy, and judgment is made as to whether the leaflets will be sufficiently pliable after commissurotomy to open adequately at a low left atrial pressure. Determination is straightforward when the leaflets are pliable and noncalcified and there is little or no coalescence of chordae. However, mitral commissurotomy can often yield reasonably good results when the valve is less ideal, and even when it is partially calcified.E4,H13 Thus, if some reasonable degree of mobility remains in the central portion of the anterior leaflet, persistent attempts should be made to open the valve widely by commissurotomy.H24

If commissurotomy is chosen, one stay suture can be placed in the midportion of the free edge of the anterior leaflet and another placed similarly in the posterior leaflet. Retraction on these sutures puts tension on the leaflets and their commissures. With a sharp-pointed scalpel (#11 blade), a stab incision is made in the fused anterolateral commissure next to the anulus (see Fig. 11-7, *B*). The incision is extended with the scalpel toward the valve orifice, in the groove of the commissural fusion. A 3- to 4-mm incision reveals the fan of underlying chordae, making it easy to stay in the middle of the commissural tissue over the center of the fan.R28 The incision is then carried into the valve orifice. Alternatively, a blunt-ended, long-handled hook is placed beneath each leaflet, and by trial and error these hooks are positioned exactly in the spot that provides the best exposure for division of each commissure. With the scalpel, an incision is made at the anterolateral commissure beginning at the valve orifice and extended toward the anulus. The surgeon takes care to follow the true line of the commissure, which extends more anteriorly than might be thought. With either method, when fused chordae are present beneath the commissure, they can usually be separated with the knife or scissors. When appropriate, the incision is carried down into the center of the papillary muscles, dividing them into anterior and posterior halves (Fig. 11-7, *C*).

The posteromedial commissure is usually less well defined and fused for a shorter distance than the anterolateral commissure. Using one of the techniques just described, this commissural leaflet tissue is incised. Chordae are often more fused beneath this commissure, and their separation by sharp dissection may be needed together with longitudinal division of the papillary muscle. If the chordae are fused together to form a fanlike fibrous sheet beneath either leaflet at one or both commissures, this sheet is fenestrated by removing a wedge of tissue from its center using a sharp-pointed scalpel. Localized but bulky calcium deposits are removed from the leaflets with bone-nibbling forceps.

A firm plastic catheter with multiple side holes (ideally a 24F chest drainage tube) is placed through the valve into the LV and tied to the left atrial vent snare to secure it. Catheter placement frustrates the valve, and the side holes lying in the left atrium are an additional safeguard to prevent ejection by the LV into the aorta until de-airing is complete. The left atrium is closed with continuous 3-0 polypropylene suture, but with the loops left loose where the catheter exits through the left atrial incision. The left atrial vent is removed during this procedure to allow the left side of the heart to fill with blood. If return to the left atrium is inadequate, right atrial pressure is raised by returning blood to the patient (see "De-Airing the Heart" in Section III of Chapter 2). With the patient's head down, the aortic clamp is released while suction is applied to the aortic vent needle. The heart is defibrillated if necessary, and the ventricle is allowed to eject into the left atrium and pericardium via the transmitral catheter until all air is clearly eliminated.

Alternatively, after completion of the commissurotomy, the left atrium is completely closed before beginning aortic root reperfusion and later removing the aortic clamp. Closure with 3-0 polypropylene suture is started at the superior angle, carried partway down, and held. With another suture, closure is begun at the inferior angle and carried superiorly until the other suture is reached. The closure must be done accurately because it is difficult to see the angles later. The sump sucker is removed, and the left atrium is filled with saline solution just before the suture line is completed. A small stab wound is made through a purse string in the ascending aorta and a small curved clamp placed through the hole to allow egress of blood and air from the LV before removing the aortic clamp. The venous line is partially clamped, and while the lungs are inflated, air is evacuated from the ascending aorta stab hole. Suction is placed on the aortic root catheter in the ascending aorta, the aortic clamp is released, and rewarming

Left atrium is opened from right side in front of right pulmonary veins. **B,** Cooley left atrial retractor is positioned. With traction on stay sutures in each leaflet, valve is well exposed for commissurotomy. An incision is made from valve orifice into posteromedial commissure; line to be incised is located by staying in leaflet tissue overlying center of underlying nest of chordae to posterior papillary muscle (see text for details). Note that correctly placed incision curves anteriorly. As incision is made, chordae beneath commissure are visualized and used as a guide for keeping incision in leaflet tissue over micelles of chordal network. *Inset,* Alternatively, incision in the fused commissure is begun about 2 mm away from anulus and, as indicated by arrow, is carried centrally.

is begun (see "Completing Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2).

If the period of global myocardial ischemia has exceeded 30 minutes, the technique of controlled aortic root or retrograde perfusion may be used (see "Cold Cardioplegia, Controlled Aortic Root Reperfusion, and [When Needed] Warm Cardioplegic Induction" in Chapter 3). These maneuvers may aid in evacuating air from the coronary arteries. If careful observation reveals LV distention, a 13-gauge needle is inserted into the RV and across the septum into the LV. After good cardiac action has returned, the usual de-airing procedures are followed (see "De-Airing the Heart" in Chapter 2).

As rewarming progresses, two right atrial and two RV myocardial wires are placed. Before decannulation, examination by TEE should confirm no more than trivial or mild mitral regurgitation.

#### Repair of Mitral Regurgitation

Repair rather than replacement is the procedure of choice for treating mitral regurgitation,C8,G3,S4 and current trends favor this approach. The proportion of patients undergoing repair for isolated mitral regurgitation rose from 51% in 2000 to 69% in 2007, as recorded in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Adult Cardiac Surgery Database.G5 However, not all cases are successfully managed in this fashion. Thus, at operation it must be determined whether repair will likely provide an acceptable result. This determination is aided appreciably by prebypass TEE. The magnitude and direction of the regurgitant jet can be assessed and the site of leaflet dysfunction accurately predicted. The abnormal valve physiology can often be characterized as restrictive, dilated, or prolapsing. These determinations allow informed decisions as to appropriate repair techniques. Repair can most confidently be performed when chordae are ruptured in a limited portion of the posterior leaflet and the anterior leaflet is essentially normal, or when there is simply prolapse of the posterior leaflet. Regurgitation from ruptured chordae to the anterior leaflet can be successfully repaired in most cases. Rheumatic mitral regurgitation can usually be repaired when distortion of the valve leaflets is minimal, as can certain cases of combined stenosis and regurgitation when commissurotomy precedes the repair. Nonrheumatic, noncalcific, almost pure mitral regurgitation in the adult, nearly always due to myxomatous degeneration, can usually be repaired. Regurgitation caused by infective endocarditis, with resultant chordal rupture or a perforated cusp, is reparable at times.B12

When regurgitation is associated with mitral valve prolapse, myxomatous degeneration, or chordal rupture, Carpentier's techniques have proven reproducible and durable. Carpentier and Kumar (of Duran's group) and their colleagues clarified the pathologic anatomy of the mitral valve.C5,C13,K21 Their observations are fundamental considerations for a repair. As observed by echocardiography or at operation, the disease process of the mitral apparatus can be classified as restrictive, normal with anular dilatation, or degenerative (leaflet prolapse) (Fig. 11-8).

Thus, with the mitral valve exposed as usual and using saline distention, areas of prolapse and regurgitation are identified. With forceps and blunt hooks (crochet hooks), each element of the valve apparatus (anulus, leaflets, chordae,

![](_page_13_Figure_9.jpeg)

**Figure 11-8** Carpentier classic mitral valve classification. (From Cohn LH. 2008: Cardiac surgery in the adult. Chapter 42, p. 1015.)

papillary muscle) is examined for pathologic changes. In particular, the normal primary chordae are distinguished from the abnormal stretched or ruptured chordae to the offending prolapsed portion. A rectangular excision of the prolapsed sector of the posterior leaflet is done (Fig. 11-9, *A*). This can involve 15% to 25% of the posterior leaflet. Further mobilization of the remaining leaflet may be accomplished by resecting some adjacent secondary and tertiary chordae. The resulting gap is bridged by a compacting (compression) suture at the base of the resected leaflet, beginning in atrial tissue just below the anulus. Alternatively, with a sliding plasty, adjacent normal portions of the posterior leaflet are incised at their bases and moved centrally to obliterate the gap (Fig. 11-9, *B* and *C*).

If a sliding plasty has been used, reconstruction is performed by suturing the mobilized leaflet to the posterior anulus and then reapproximating the cut edges of the leaflets with interrupted nonabsorbable sutures.C13 Other techniques for closing the gap between the resected leaflets have been described, including the folding plasty technique.G29,M21,S11

Usually an anuloplasty ring is then sutured into place to both support the repair and narrow the anulus (Fig. 11-9, *D* and *E*). Proper sizing of the anuloplasty ring (whether flexible or fixed) is essential to maintain competence and avoid postoperative LV outflow tract narrowing. Basically, the ring must recreate the normal anteroposterior depth of the anulus, which typically is the anteroposterior length of the splayed anterior leaflet. Thus, the size of the anterior leaflet rather than the intercommissural distance should be used to select the appropriate ring size. However, there is no uniform agreement about the technique or even the need to precisely measure anterior leaflet dimensions for ring selection. Brown and colleagues from the Mayo Clinic reported reproducibly good outcomes using a standard 63-mm posterior band in adult patients, without specific measurements.B43

*Anterior leaflet prolapse* repair (sector A2) is more difficult and less often successful than posterior leaflet repair. A triangular wedge of the involved leaflet is resected, the leaflet is reconstructed, and a ring is placed (Fig. 11-10). To preserve available anterior leaflet for proper coaptation, the triangular resection should extend no more than one third of the distance between the free edge of the anterior leaflet and the mitral anulus.G8,S35 Often the repair involves other techniques described by Duran, Carpentier, Antunes, and Orszulak and their colleagues.A20,C12,D27,O5 These maneuvers are technically demanding and not as reliable as those applied to the posterior leaflet. Techniques include chordal shortening, chordal

Rectangular segment of leaflet tissue is excised back to anulus with lines of excision straight, not convex and outward. **B,** After quadrangular resection, repair is accomplished in two phases. Anulus is narrowed at base of leaflet resection using a compression suture with or without pledgets, either figure-of-eight or horizontal mattress, with bites on ventricular and atrial aspects of anulus, to reapproximate the two sides of posterior leaflet. **C,** Remaining segments of posterior leaflet are moved toward one another (sliding plasty) and reapproximated to base of leaflet.

Purse-string effect is attained both between the two arms of the suture and between each mattress suture. **F,** Completed ring insertion both narrows anulus and bolsters posterior repair. Only 10 to 12 double-armed mattress sutures are necessary to secure the ring. **Figure 11-9, cont'd**

transfer,C5,C12 and occasionally reimplantation of partially ruptured papillary muscles.

*Chordal transfer* involves excising the leaflet insertion of a normal intact chord from the posterior leaflet, flipping it anteriorly, and attaching it to the flail anterior prolapsing sectorD24 (Fig. 11-11). *Chordal shortening* may also be used in such cases. The papillary muscle is split, and the chord is shortened by embedding it in the muscle.D25,P9

Currently, however, chordal transfer techniques have been largely replaced by placing artificial chords. Diseased chordae tendineae may simply be replaced by 5-0 expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) suturesD8,F7 (Fig. 11-12). A doublearmed suture is passed twice through the usually fibrous tip of the papillary muscle; each arm is then passed through the area of the leaflet where the native chordae are inserted, usually in a figure-of-eight fashion with each suture, and then tied. Intermediate-term results with this technique have been good.D8,Z3

Dreyfus and colleagues have described an extensive experience with *papillary muscle repositioning* for anterior leaflet prolapse.D22 The anterior head of the anterolateral papillary muscle is repositioned for A1/A2 prolapse, and the anterior head of the posteromedial papillary is repositioned for A2/A3 prolapse (Fig. 11-13).

Alfieri and colleagues have described a simple technique that may be useful for anterior leaflet prolapseA12,A13 (Fig. 11-14). When the prolapse is near the commissure, the anterior and posterior leaflets are approximated "edge to edge" with one or two mattress sutures or, alternatively, with a figure-of-eight braided polyester suture. When the prolapse is in the central portion of the valve, one or two edge-to-edge leaflet-approximating sutures create a double-orifice mitral valve that functions adequately.U1 Because mitral stenosis is a possible complication of this technique, it should probably be applied mainly in degenerative mitral valve disease. The resultant orifices should be at least 2 cm in diameter.B41

sutures are typically used.

When there is *bileaflet prolapse* without anterior chordal pathology, often posterior leaflet resection and ring anuloplasty alone serve to correct the regurgitation, providing a durable repair without an additional procedure directed at the anterior leaflet.G14

When repair rather than replacement is done for *rheumatic mitral regurgitation* in adults, anuloplasty (generally using Carpentier's method, including an anuloplasty ring) has been the technique employed in most cases (see Fig. 11-9). When anuloplasty is necessary in young children with years of growth ahead, an anuloplasty ring is not used. Instead, an asymmetric measured anuloplasty is done by the technique described by Reed and colleaguesR14,R16 (Fig. 11-15). This operation, as with most repairs of mitral regurgitation, is based on the fact that the central portion of the anterior mitral leaflet is usually pliable and of good quality. Its leading edge forms the line of closure for the repaired valve, both in the Reed repair and after insertion of a Carpentier ring.

Determining competence of the repaired valve while the left atrium remains open is imprecise. Yacoub's maneuver involves perfusing warm blood into the aortic root proximal to the clamp through the cardioplegic needle or aortic root catheter so that function of the repaired valve can be inspected with the heart beating.Y1 A simpler method involves injecting saline under pressure through the valve into the LV. The distended leaflets and their opposing surfaces are examined, and areas of leakage, if present, are identified. The entire line of closure of the leaflets should be parallel to the mural part of the anulus—that is, to the hinge line of the posterior leaflet (or to this portion of the anuloplasty ring).C5 If all this is satisfactory, the left atrium is closed, de-airing is performed as described under Open Mitral Commissurotomy, and CPB is discontinued. At this point, competence of the valve is assessed by TEE. If more than mild regurgitation is present, CPB is resumed,M12 and the mitral valve is either re-repaired or replaced. In one institution, intraoperative TEE identified 26 of 309 patients (8%) undergoing repair for mitral regurgitation who had immediate failure of the procedure and required further repair or replacement at the same operation. Used in this manner, intraoperative TEE can limit the number of those who require late reoperation for failed repair.M8

#### Repair of Mitral Regurgitation Associated with Submitral Left Ventricular Aneurysms

CPB and myocardial management are as described for other mitral valve operations. The left atrium is opened from the right side. The aneurysmal sac is entered through an incision in the floor of the left atrium, parallel to and about 20 mm posterior to the hinge line of the posterior leaflet. The usually narrow pathway or "neck" between the LV and aneurysm is then easily visualized.A18 This pathway can be closed with interrupted pledgeted mattress sutures, bringing

them anteriorly through the hinge line of the posterior leaflet. The opening from the left atrium into the aneurysm is then closed, draining the now-evacuated and exteriorized aneurysmal sac through its free wall into the pleural space if desired. Reparative operations can be performed for residual mitral regurgitation if indicated.

#### Mitral Valve Replacement

#### *Classic Procedure*

Mitral valve replacement begins with exposure of the mitral valve as described for mitral commissurotomy, using one or two valve hooks to display the leaflets. To excise the valve, an incision is begun with the knife in the center of the anterior mitral leaflet at approximately the 12-o'clock position about 2 mm from the anulus, because at that point the leaflet tissue is typically pliable and free of disease (Fig. 11-16). The incision is carried from this point leftward and rightward, either with the knife or scissors, and on to the commissural leaflet tissue at the anterolateral and posteromedial commissures. The incisions through the commissural leaflet tissue are kept next to the anulus so that the anterior and posterior leaflets stay together. The underlying papillary muscle and fused chordae are cut just in front of the incision for better exposure.

Classically, the excision is continued to the posterior leaflet from both sides. Ordinarily the posterior leaflet and its chordae are left in place when they are thin and pliable.G21 Thus only the anterior leaflet is fully excised (but see "Chordal Sparing Procedure" later in this section). If this is not possible because of extensive disease, the secondary chordae that tether the posterior leaflet to the underlying ventricular myocardium are cut. When subanular calcification is present and can be excised without disturbing the anulus or the myocardium, it is removed. Otherwise, calcification is left in situ because overzealous efforts may damage the circumflex coronary artery or precipitate postrepair ventricular rupture.M14

The mechanical prosthesis or bioprosthesis can be sewn into place with interrupted simple sutures, but preferably with horizontal mattress sutures using pledgets on the atrial side, or with a continuous size 0 polypropylene suture (Figs. 11-17 and 11-18). All methods are associated with an extremely low

**Figure 11-16** Mitral valve replacement: classic procedure. Approach is through a median sternotomy that opens left atrium from right side anterior to right pulmonary veins (see Fig. 11-6 legend). Two venous cannulae are illustrated, but a single venous cannula can be used. Cooley left atrial retractor is used. As described in text, incision in mitral leaflet is begun with knife anteriorly and about 2 mm from anulus, where leaflet usually is pliable and relatively free of disease. As incision is carried leftward with knife or scissors toward anterolateral commissure, underlying papillary muscle and fused chordae come into view and are incised. As incision is carried across anterolateral (illustrated here) and posteromedial commissural areas, care is taken to stay close to anulus so valve is kept in one piece. This greatly facilitates completing the valve excision. Key: *Ao,* Ascending aorta; *SVC,* superior vena cava.

prevalence of periprosthetic leakageD17 (see "Periprosthetic Leakage" under Modes of Death later in this section). A technique employing interrupted pledgeted mattress sutures with the pledgets on the ventricular side may be chosen when heavy calcification remains in some areas of the anulus or, rarely, when exposure is particularly difficult. With this technique, all sutures are placed in the heart first and then passed through the valve sewing ring. The prosthesis can then be lowered into position and the sutures tied. Protruding suture ends can damage the leaflets of bioprostheses.

After completing the valve insertion, a catheter is passed through the valve into the LV to act as a frustrator. The steps for exiting from the left side of the heart and de-airing are as described for mitral stenosis.

#### *Chordal Sparing Procedure*

Information based on experimental observation and clinical experience indicates that retention (rather than resection) of the mitral tensor apparatus at mitral valve replacement results in better LV function postoperativelyL12,M29,M30,M31,S25,Y6 (see "Cardiac Performance" later in this section). To insert a prosthesis while retaining both the anterior and posterior chordal attachments, the anterior leaflet may be split centrally and folded laterally and the posterior leaflet left as is. Alternatively, both the intact anterior and intact posterior leaflets can be folded toward their bases, then a prosthesis inserted (Fig. 11-19). These maneuvers (including folding the anterior leaflet) do not result in LV outflow tract obstruction or prosthetic obstruction when done for mitral regurgitation.E16

#### SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

In both the operating room and intensive care unit, patients may display a large *v* wave in the left atrial pressure pulse. This is *not* a reliable indicator of mitral valve regurgitation, because the height of the *v* wave is related primarily to the level of mean left atrial pressure,B33 and in patients who have just undergone mitral valve repair or replacement, mean left atrial pressure is usually elevated. TEE can settle this issue.

Care of patients after mitral valve procedures is as described in Chapter 5. Ventricular unloading is an important aspect of the postoperative maintenance of optimal cardiac output in patients operated on for mitral regurgitation. Restoring mitral competence increases load-resisting shortening.M4 Thus, by removing a parallel low-resistance circuit, myocardial oxygen requirement increases along with impairment of myocardial contractile reserve. Nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors are useful for decreasing afterload and improving cardiac performance.

Patients undergoing mitral valve replacement, including those receiving bioprostheses and often those undergoing commissurotomy or repair of mitral regurgitation, are begun on anticoagulant therapy using warfarin the evening of postoperative day 1 or 2 (day of surgery is postoperative day 0). For adults with a normal prothrombin time (PT), the initial dose is generally 7.5 to 15 mg, followed by daily doses in the hospital guided by daily PT measurements. The goal is prothrombin activity 20% to 30% of normal or PT twice the control value. This is best monitored and regulated using the international normalized ratio (INR) terminology. The INR allows standardizing the determination of PTs by accounting for differences among commercial thromboplastin reagents.R22 Optimal INR for patients after mitral valve replacement is 2.5 to 3.5.

When a mechanical valve has been inserted, this program is continued indefinitely, and the patient is educated about its extreme importance. Warfarin appears to be associated with a greater risk of excessive anticoagulation (hemorrhage) than reduced anticoagulation (thromboembolism and thrombosis). Thus, an appropriate recommendation is an INR of about 2.5 to 3.5.C2,H20,K4 (See Special Situations and Controversies for additional details on long-term anticoagulation.)

**Figure 11-17** Mitral valve replacement: continuous suture technique. **A,** One end of a double-armed size 0 polypropylene suture buttressed with a felt pledget is passed through mitral anulus just posterior to anterolateral commissure. Suture is then passed through prosthetic sewing ring, and valve without holder is lowered into place. Using about four throws, suture line is carried to the left, anteriorly passing stitches from anulus to sewing ring and taking deep bites, but avoiding noncoronary cusp of aortic valve. Suture is held midway across distance to posteromedial commissure. **B,** Other end of the suture, having been placed through mitral anulus as a mattress, is placed into prosthetic sewing ring and continued from anulus to sewing ring with four or five throws. It is helpful to move prosthesis in and out of anulus to accommodate needle passage. Suture is held. A second double-armed pledgeted suture is begun as a horizontal mattress just posterior to posteromedial commissure. Its ends are carried with four or five throws in each direction, first anteriorly and then posteriorly, to meet and tie with previously held ends. Knots then lie behind leaflet guards of the St. Jude Medical prosthesis depicted here.

![](_page_21_Picture_3.jpeg)

When a bioprosthesis is inserted or anuloplasty or valvotomy performed, anticoagulation is continued for 2 to 3 months. Lower INR values (1.5-2.0) are acceptable during this period. Patients who undergo mitral valve repair and have paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation should continue long-term anticoagulation with warfarin. Long-term treatment with low-dose aspirin (75-100 mg/day) is probably advisable for patients who remain in sinus rhythm after mitral valve repair.B31

B

Patients who have undergone mitral valve repair or replacement should receive anti-endocarditis prophylactic antibiotics for medical procedures as indicated.

Evaluation of mitral valve repair or replacement by 2D and Doppler echocardiography should be routinely performed before hospital discharge or at first follow-up clinic visit. Assessment of right and left ventricular systolic function and identification of any residual mitral regurgitation will help guide afterload reduction therapy.

**Figure 11-18** Mitral valve replacement: interrupted suture technique. **A,** Double-armed size 0 polyester sutures are generally placed with pledgets on atrial aspect of anulus. It is convenient to place one arm of a mattress suture just behind posteromedial commissure, reserving other end for placement later and holding suture for exposure. **B,** Posterior suture line proceeds counterclockwise beginning at anterolateral commissure. Sutures are placed from atrial side to ventricular side of anulus and may either be held or placed in prosthetic sewing ring. **C,** Anterior suture line usually proceeds clockwise from anterolateral commissure to posteromedial commissure. Along whole circumference, suture bites encompass base of residual leaflet. Clockwise from anterolateral commissure are the aortic cusps, conduction system, atrioventricular septum, coronary sinus, and circumflex coronary artery, which are at risk when bites are taken too deeply. With all sutures in place and on tension, valve is lowered into place and sutures tied, with about 12 mattress sutures used. Before tying, device struts are inspected to ensure that no suture is looped around a strut or caught within the device.

Lateral and medial aspects of anterior leaflet remain and retain their chordal attachments. **B,** Residual portions of leaflet are folded back to be sutured to anulus. Leaving anterior leaflet totally intact may risk left ventricular outflow tract obstruction or, in the case of replacement for mitral stenosis, residual left ventricular *inflow* obstruction. Prosthesis is sutured into place using previously described interrupted (**C** and **D**) or continuous (**E** and **F**) suture technique. In either case, sutures surround retained leaflets, adding strength and purchase to the repair.

#### RESULTS

#### Mitral Commissurotomy

#### *Survival*

In an earlier era, mortality after closed commissurotomy was high.E9,G28,H18 In the current era, *hospital mortality* after either closed or open commissurotomy approaches zero, and late survival is similar in risk-adjusted comparisons.H13,R9 A difference exists only in prevalence of postcommissurotomy mitral regurgitation (see "Mitral Regurgitation" in text that follows).

In many institutions, percutaneous catheter valvotomy has almost completely replaced surgical commissurotomy for isolated mitral stenosis. Procedure mortality approaches zero,I4 and risk of complications (bleeding, severe regurgitation) requiring urgent operation is low.

Intermediate-term survival is good in those with favorable immediate hemodynamic results (Fig. 11-20).

Mitral commissurotomy is not curative with either open or closed (or balloon) commissurotomy, with survival progressively diverging from that of the general populationC29,C31,E5,G28,N2,S24 (Fig. 11-21). However, few late deaths result directly from the effects of recurrent or residual mitral stenosis or regurgitation. Rather, they result from thromboembolism or early or later sequelae of reoperation and mitral valve replacement.

#### *Incremental Risk Factors for Premature Death*

Few deaths occur early after mitral commissurotomy,H13,S24 and no risk factors are associated with these. Risk factors associated with later deathsH13,S24 include elevated Rp before commissurotomy, which directly affects survival rather than leading to reintervention, but its effect is moderate (Fig.

![](_page_24_Figure_13.jpeg)

**Figure 11-20** Survival after percutaneous mitral commissurotomy. Of the 112 patients who had poor immediate results, only 19% ± 4.0% were free from surgery at 5 years. (From Iung and colleagues.I4)

11-22 and Table 11-2). The aforementioned *morphologic* risk factors lead to recurrent symptoms and reintervention, usually valve replacement, and affect survival in this manner. Although not evident in a risk factor analysis using only preoperative variables, development of important mitral regurgitation after commissurotomy and occurrence of a thromboembolic event both adversely affect survival.

#### *Mitral Regurgitation*

Mitral regurgitation is a risk of mitral commissurotomy by any technique, but occurs in only 2% to 5% of patients who

undergo open commissurotomy<sup>S24</sup> and in about 10% of patients who undergo closed commissurotomy. H13,H18 Rarely does the newly developed regurgitation require immediate operation, but it may lead to reoperation within a few months. Mild postcommissurotomy mitral regurgitation has little effect on survival or need for mitral valve replacement, but important postcommissurotomy regurgitation adversely affects both (Fig. 11-23).

Prevalence of new important mitral regurgitation is about 10% after percutaneous balloon mitral commissurotomy. Al

#### Cardiac Performance

Increase in calculated mitral valve area (or orifice size) produced by commissurotomy varies greatly and depends not only on the surgical opening but also on leaflet pliability and extent of subvalvar obstruction from fused chordae. Feigenbaum and colleagues found that closed mitral commissurotomy, usually with a transventricular dilator, increased mitral valve area by an average of 1.3 to 2.6 cm², with postoperative mitral valve areas ranging from 0.7 to 5.8 cm².

<sup>b</sup>Variables entered into the analysis, coefficients, and *P* values of the risk factors are provided in original article. Postcommissurotomy variables such as residual mitral regurgitation were excluded from this analysis.

CType of commissurotomy (open or closed) was not a risk factor.

Younger patients tend to have a better functional result<sup>C22</sup> and experience greater increases in calculated valve area than older patients, <sup>E2</sup> perhaps because younger patients tend to have more pliable valves. The same general results are achieved by both open and closed commissurotomy and percutaneous balloon mitral valvotomy (Fig. 11-24). Enlargement after percutaneous balloon valvotomy results primarily from splitting of fused commissures. <sup>M17</sup>

Somewhat better orifices can be obtained by open than closed commissurotomy. S24 Nakano and colleagues achieved valve areas of  $2.52 \pm 0.19$  cm² in patients with pliable valves and minimal subvalvar disease, as well as good but smaller orifices in patients with extensive subvalvar diseases. Ben Farhat and colleagues reported an equivalent increase of mitral valve area  $(0.9-2.2 \text{ cm}^2)$  for open commissurotomy and percutaneous balloon valvotomy that was greater than for closed commissurotomy  $(0.9-1.6 \text{ cm}^2)$ .

hemodynamic results continued over a 7-year follow-up period (see Fig. 11-24).

A secondary effect of increased orifice size is lowering of left atrial pressure, although it frequently remains above normal. On average, left atrial pressure at rest is about 12 mm Hg after valvotomy, increasing to about 17 mm Hg

on exercise. LV end-diastolic pressure often is modestly higher after commissurotomy. F2

Cardiac output is usually increased by operation, and the amount of increase at rest and exercise correlates well with the increase in calculated valve area. F2 Rp usually falls immediately, especially in young patients, as verified by Block and Palacios during percutaneous balloon commissurotomy. Pulmonary artery pressure usually falls, which correlates well with the decrease in left atrial pressure and Rp.

#### Thromboembolism

Successful mitral commissurotomy may reduce the likelihood of thromboembolism, although accurate comparisons are not available. About 90% of patients are free of a thromboembolic event 8 to 10 years after open commissurotomy. C29,E5 The linearized rate of thromboembolism has been reported at 1% to 2% per patient-year. C29,E5,G28,H13,H22,S24 This statistic is not very useful, however, because the hazard function for a first or subsequent thromboembolic event is not constant (Fig. 11-25). Atrial fibrillation, older age, and a history of thromboembolism preoperatively are reported risk factors for postcommissurotomy thromboembolism. E5,S24 Also, a postcommissurotomy thromboembolic event predisposes the patient to further events (Table 11-3). The type of surgical commissurotomy, open or closed, has not been shown to be a risk factor.

#### **Functional Status**

Successful open or closed mitral commissurotomy, in properly selected patients, results in dramatic relief of symptoms. More than 90% of patients are in NYHA functional class I or II during the first 1 or 2 postoperative years G28,H2,H22,S24 (Fig. 11-26). Lack of permanent favorable results from mitral commissurotomy is evident in the gradual decline in functional status. Redevelopment of symptoms results from gradual loss of leaflet pliability as well as progression of subvalvar pathology and increase of valvar calcification. Although recurrence of rheumatic fever may accelerate this pathology, progression seems to occur even without further rheumatic episodes. Thus, NYHA functional class correlates well with estimated area of the mitral orifice late postoperatively; the mean value

is 2.0 cm² in class I patients, 1.7 in class II, and 1.6 in class III. B40 Immobility of valve leaflets and obstructive subvalvar agglutination of chordae are the main risk factors for a poor early functional result. H18 Calcification of a portion of the leaflet(s) does not preclude a satisfactory result.

Despite excellent early and intermediate results in the current era, durability of results is limited. Scarring from the rheumatic process in the valve seems to progress gradually. Eventually, although not until 20 years postoperatively in some patients, most patients lose their good functional status and return with restenosis or new-onset regurgitation (Fig. 11-27). Absence of leaflet pliability in the presence of valvar calcification is a risk factor for the rate of decline in functional

status after all types of commissurotomy. Type of surgical commissurotomy (open or closed) has not been shown to be a risk factor<sup>H13</sup> (Table 11-4).

#### Reintervention

Most patients undergoing mitral commissurotomy by any technique will require another procedure at some time, generally mitral valve replacement because of gradual loss of leaflet pliability, progression of subvalvar pathology, and increase of valvar calcification C29,E5,E6,N1,N2 (see Fig. 11-27). About 20% of patients undergoing surgical commissurotomy require valve replacement within 10 years, and about half require it by 20 years (Fig. 11-28).

The same variables that cause survival to vary probably cause prevalence of postcommissurotomy mitral valve replacement to vary (Table 11-5). Again, type of surgical commissurotomy (open or closed) has not been demonstrated to be a risk factor for subsequent mitral valve replacement. Morphology of the mitral valve powerfully affects the time-related prevalence of mitral valve replacement after surgical commissurotomy (Fig. 11-29) as well as after percutaneous balloon valvotomy. At 7 years, freedom from restenosis was 93% for the open and balloon procedures vs. 63% after closed commissurotomy.

#### Percutaneous Balloon Valvotomy

Early hemodynamic, functional, and anatomic improvement after percutaneous mitral valvotomy is, as noted earlier, nearly equivalent to results following open surgical commissurotomy. Long-term outcomes are not available. There is a progressive decrease in valve area that closely parallels that seen historically and in concurrent studies for surgical approaches. Degree of deterioration can be predicted by variables related to preoperative functional class and morphologic features of the mitral valve (Table 11-6 and Fig. 11-30). Thus, long-term survival and need for reintervention after the catheter approach should be similar to results after the open surgical approach.

#### Redo Mitral Commissurotomy

Survival after a second mitral commissurotomy is surprisingly good in view of the more advanced valvar pathology usually present at reoperation. Peper and colleagues report 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival of 96%, 83%, and 63%, respectively, after

#### *Survival*

**Early (Hospital) Death** Hospital mortality after repair of isolated nonischemic mitral regurgitation is very low in the current era. Hospital mortality of 1% for isolated elective nonischemic mitral valve repair was reported in the STS Adult Cardiac Surgery Database in 2009.G5

**Time-Related Survival** Time-related survival, including hospital deaths, of patients with mitral regurgitation undergoing repair with or without other cardiac procedures has been better than that of patients undergoing replacement. Most groups have reported similar findings, with 4- or 5-year survival after repair varying from 74% to 94%.A10,C30,D23,D26,E14,R15,S30 Ten-year survival of one group of patients undergoing repair with or without other procedures was 59%.S4

Variability in survival among reports and improved survival after repair compared with replacement are related in part to the differing prevalence of risk factors for death.D7,G3 Mayo Clinic surgeons reported surgical mortality of 2.6% for repair and 10% for replacement (*P* = .002).E14 Late survival (in surgical survivors) at 10 years was 69% ± 6.0% vs. 58% ± 5.0% (*P* = .02), and late survival after valve repair did not differ from expected survival (Fig. 11-31). Again, the two groups differed mainly in degree of preoperative heart failure.G16 A multicenter European study reported a 30-day mortality of 0.7% and a superior risk-adjusted 5-year survival with repair versus replacement (92% vs. 80%, *P* < .001).G26 To address comparison of repair versus replacement, Gillinov and colleagues used propensity-score matching (see "Clinical Studies with Nonrandomly Assigned Treatment" in Chapter 6) and found that repair conferred a survival advantage in most (89%) patients that became evident after about 2 years.

#### *Modes of Death*

Modes of death early and late after mitral valve repair are similar to those after mitral valve replacement.S4 The most common mode is cardiac failure.

#### *Incremental Risk Factors for Premature Death*

Incremental risk factors for premature death after repair of mitral regurgitation are the same as those after replacement (Table 11-7). In the UAB experience, neither procedure was a risk factor vis-à-vis the other. Akins and Dujardin and their colleagues, however, indicate that mitral valve replacement is a risk factor for late mortality compared with mitral repair in a univariable analysis, but not by multivariable analysis.A10,D23 In most studies, this reflects choice of replacement for those

patients who are older or in a more advanced NYHA functional class. However, Gillinov and colleagues found by both multivariable analysis and propensity adjustment that replacement was a risk factor.G16

#### *Residual or Recurrent Mitral Regurgitation*

Many patients have no residual mitral regurgitation after repair.S4,S29 Alvarez and colleagues reported that only 4.5% of 155 repair patients experienced repair failure within 6 months.A15 In a group of more than 1000 patients analyzed for late failure, only 30 repair patients needed late reoperation (freedom from reoperation at 10 years 93%; CL 91%-94%).G13 Recurrent regurgitation in these and other series is caused by either progression of disease or inadequate operation, including suture dehiscence.G13 In most patients, residual regurgitation is present immediately after repair rather than developing later.M15 Although reoperation may underestimate the prevalence of late regurgitation, various groups report freedom from reoperation of 80% to 96% at 10- to 15-year follow-up, suggesting satisfactory durability of repair.D6,D13,F10,P7

A clear relationship has not been established between technique of repair and prevalence of residual regurgitation. However, repair is clearly more effective for patients with *degenerative* (myxomatous) disease than for those with

*restrictive* (rheumatic) diseaseD6,L7 (Fig. 11-32). The best results may be in patients with ruptured chordae to the posterior leaflet,S16,G9 although Orszulak and colleagues have found almost equally good results when the ruptured chordae belong to the anterior leaflet.M27,O5 For complex repairs and those involving the anterior leaflet, chordal replacement is superior to chordal shortening.L7,P9 Historically, surgical repair of posterior leaflet prolapse has been more durable than repair of anterior leaflet prolapse, but results of the latter have improved in the current era.S36 Lawrie and colleagues reported a contemporary experience in which outcomes were equally good for artificial chord replacement in anterior leaflet prolapse as in posterior leaflet prolapsed. L4 In patients with isolated posterior leaflet prolapse, chordal replacement plus anuloplasty ring appears to provide midterm valve competence equivalent to that of traditional quadrangular resection plus ring. L3 Others have extended leaflet resection to the severely prolapsing anterior leaflet with good midterm valve function. G8,S6 Gazoni and colleagues emphasize, however,

**Figure 11-32** Freedom from reoperation after mitral valve repair in patients with rheumatic and degenerative etiologies for mitral regurgitation.

that a triangular resection technique should be used, and the height of the resected leaflet segment should not exceed one third of the distance from the anulus to the free edge of the anterior leaflet.

#### Cardiac Performance

LV performance responds to mitral valve repair in the same general manner as it does to mitral valve replacement. L8 Some regression of LV hypertrophy occurs, with decreased heart size, LV volume, and muscle mass. D9,G1,S20 Preoperative LV systolic function is more or less preserved, although EF is often moderately decreased. However, some studies document LV performance to be better after mitral valve repair than after replacement. Corin and colleagues found that systolic and diastolic function returned to normal in mitral repair patients, but that global and regional systolic function as well as diastolic function were depressed in replacement patients. This difference is probably attributable to preservation of the tensor apparatus in the repaired valve. (Fig. 11-33) but may also reflect earlier intervention in patients undergoing repair vs. replacement.

An important issue is the potential reversal of preexisting LV dysfunction following mitral valve repair (also see discussion of mitral valve repair in Chapter 20). Among patients with preserved EF preoperatively, large regurgitant volume (>80 mL by quantitative Doppler and proximal isovelocity surface area method) $^{Y2}$  is predictive of LV dysfunction (EF < 50%) following mitral valve repair.

#### Thromboembolism

Patients undergoing mitral valve repair are generally free of late thromboembolic complications, even though they rarely receive anticoagulants. Duran and colleagues found 93% of patients free of thromboembolism within the first 4.5 years after repair, a prevalence similar to that for xenograft replacement in their experience. D26

#### Left Ventricular Outflow Obstruction

In about 5% to 10% of patients with mitral regurgitation associated with mitral valve prolapse, abnormal *systolic anterior motion* (SAM) of the mitral valve develops immediately after mitral anuloplasty with a Carpentier ring. G2,K18 Related to this, gradients of 60 mmHg across the LV outflow tract have been measured. K19 This complication appears to be

**Figure 11-34** Freedom from reoperation after mitral valve repair in children younger than age 12 years. Vertical bars represent one standard error. (From Chauvaud and colleagues.C19)

limited to patients with myxomatous degenerationK18,M20,S9 and excessive redundancy of the anterior and posterior leaflets, although presence of a small hyperdynamic LV and excessive ventricular hypertrophy may also contribute. SAM is now believed to be the result of anterior displacement of leaflet coaptation.L5 LV outflow tract obstruction has not been observed in patients undergoing suture (rather than ring) mitral anuloplasty.D5 Cosgrove and colleagues have shown that simple removal of the rigid anuloplasty ring abolished the obstruction while retaining competence of the mitral valve.C37 Substitution of a larger ring, flexible ring, or half-ring or addition of a posterior leaflet sliding plasty may also eliminate SAM. Grossi and colleagues noted a prevalence of 6.4% (CL 5.2%-7.8%) in their series of valve repair. All patients were treated medically, with resolution of gradients in all patients and resolution of SAM in half of patients within a year.G30

#### *Functional Status*

Functional status of most patients is excellent after repair or replacement of a regurgitant mitral valve, with greater than 90% of surviving patients in NYHA class I or II.E8,L9,S4

#### *Reoperation*

Freedom from reoperation late after mitral valve repair is generally 85% to 95% at 10 years,A6,A20,C37,G15,P1,R13,R14,R15 similar to that after mitral valve replacement.M27 Prevalence of reoperation is greater for anterior leaflet repair than for posterior leaflet repair.L14

Factors that may increase risk of reoperation late after repair include rheumatic disease (as opposed to degenerative disease; see Fig. 11-32), advanced degenerative changes involving the anterior leaflet, and residual regurgitation at completion of the initial procedure. When patients with 1+ or 2+ (of possible 4+) early postoperative regurgitation were compared with those with "echo-perfect" results (no regurgitation), Fix and colleagues found 83% freedom from reoperation in the former group vs. 96% in the latter group at late follow-up (*P* = .07).F4 Type of repair appears to have no effect on prevalence of reoperation.S29 Reed, Chauvaud, and Ohno and their colleagues showed mitral repair to be as successful in children as in adultsC20,O2,R14 (Fig. 11-34).

![](_page_32_Figure_10.jpeg)

**Figure 11-35** Separately determined hazards for mitral valve reoperation in patients with mitral regurgitation who have undergone repair or replacement (UAB group, 1975 to July 1983). (See original article for equations, *P* values, and coefficients.) (From Sand and colleagues.S4)

The *hazard function* of reoperation after repair of mitral regurgitation is low, constant, and different from that of replacement (Fig. 11-35). Mitral valve repair does not have the peaking early hazard phase for reoperation, which in mitral replacement is related to periprosthetic leakage and prosthetic valve endocarditis. Furthermore, at least until now, no rising late hazard phase for reoperation after repair has been demonstrated, indicating the durability of this approach. In fact, in a 20-year experience reported by the Mayo Clinic, the absolute prevalence of reoperation in the current era was 5% ± 2% for posterior leaflet repair and 10% ± 2% for anterior leaflet repair at 10 years.M27 A more recent analysis from the Mayo ClinicS36 examined reoperations after mitral valve repair over 35 years. New pathology was the cause for reoperation in about 55% of patients, and failure of mitral repair in most of the remainder. Mitral valve re-repair was possible in 44% of patients.

#### *Infective Endocarditis*

Infective endocarditis is rare after repair of mitral regurgitation.G13 No cases were found in the UAB experience, with a follow-up of 21 to 120 months.S4 This complication is more common when the affected valve is replaced rather than repaired.S4

#### Mitral Valve Replacement

#### *Survival*

**Early (Hospital) Death** *Hospital mortality* after primary isolated mitral valve replacement for nonischemic valve disease with preserved LV function is generally less than 2% among patients without serious comorbidities in the current era.G12 A hospital mortality of 5.7% for isolated mitral valve replacement for any etiology, primary and reoperation, was reported from the STS Adult Cardiac Surgery Database during the years 2002 to 2006.O1 Medicare sources indicated a hospital mortality of 14% for isolated mitral valve replacement among patients older than age 65.G20 Mortality after mitral valve replacement with tricuspid surgery is similar or slightly higher.G12 When mitral valve replacement has been preceded by mitral valve repair, hospital mortality is not affected appreciably.

Time-Related Survival Considering both isolated mitral valve replacement and replacement done concomitantly with other procedures, 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival in an earlier era was 82%, 68%, and 55%, respectively. The hazard function had a rapidly declining early phase, but also a constant phase extending as long as patients had been followed (Fig. 11-36). Time-related survival has been higher in patients undergoing primary isolated mitral valve replacement than in those having replacement combined with other cardiac procedures (Fig. 11-37). Survivals similar to those reported here, including some 15-year survivals of 35% to 50%, have been reported by other groups. B10,C25,L6,L16,T3,W7 Both early and late survival after primary mitral replacement are considerably improved over that obtained in earlier eras. A21,B10,H3 Improvement is related to better myocardial management,F3 reduction in technical problems such as atrioventricular rupture and air embolization, and improved mechanical and bioprosthetic valve replacement devices.

Survival both early and late after reoperation is less than that after original valve replacement (Fig. 11-38). This is related not only to technical aspects of reoperation but also to the fact that prosthetic valve endocarditis is often the indication for reoperation, and reoperative patients as a group tend to have greater functional disability than those undergoing their first valve replacement.

Mitral valve replacement in children and adolescents has low early mortality, and time-related survival is probably

equal to or superior to that of adults. However, mitral replacement in the first year of life may carry a higher risk; 9 of 25 patients died (36%; CL 25%-48%) in the experience of Kadoba and colleagues. Reven of the deaths were in patients with atrioventricular (AV) septal defects. Recent experience with improved repair of the left AV valve in AV septal defects, better myocardial management, and supraanular placement of the prosthesis have reduced early risk in infants considerably (see Results in Chapter 34). Time-related morbidity is attributable to reoperation associated with bioprosthetic tissue degeneration and acquired prosthetic stenosis associated with somatic growth.

#### Modes of Death

Most early deaths are attributable to cardiac failure, usually acute and within a few days of operation. Subacute cardiac failure may be the mode of death in the hospital or within 1

to 2 months after hospital discharge. It is characterized by stable but low cardiac output and consequent widespread subsystem failure, often including cool (rarely frankly ischemic) extremities, abdominal distention, and occasionally ischemic bowel, gastrointestinal bleeding, jaundice, poor renal function, and mental confusion. Infection may occur as a terminal event.

#### *Incremental Risk Factors for Premature Death*

Some of the incremental risk factors for death that existed during the earliest eras of mitral valve replacementB26 have been neutralized by improvements in surgical technique, myocardial management (see Chapter 3), and perioperative care (see Chapters 4 and 5). Among specific improvements is sparing of the tensor apparatus, as demonstrated particularly by the Stanford group (see "Cardiac Performance" later in this section).H5-H7,M30,M31 Although from an earlier era,F3,R12 Table 11-8 depicts basic risk factors for mortality following primary mitral valve replacement that are still applicable.

**Older Age** Older age at operation continues to be an incremental risk factor in both the early and constant hazard phasesB26,F3,G33,P10,W7 (see Table 11-8). However, the increments are not great and appear to be related more to general risks of older age than to a specifically increased sensitivity to cardiac surgery; survival in the oldest group is predicted to be equivalent to or better than that in the general population (as is also the case after aortic valve replacement; see Chapter 12). Despite the generally favorable results in elderly patients in experienced centers,D18 numerous reports indicate important hospital mortality in patients older than age 75 undergoing mitral valve replacement for mitral regurgitation. Overall reported operative mortality in this age group in the United States exceeds 14%G20,N11 and is notably higher (>20%) in low-volume centers.G20

**Nonischemic Mitral Regurgitation** In contrast to mitral stenosis, nonischemic mitral regurgitation is probably a risk factor for death (see Table 11-8), but not to the extent that might be predicted from the sudden increase in LV afterload imposed when the regurgitant mitral valve is made competent. This is probably because a number of the other sudden hemodynamic changes (e.g., reduction in LV stroke work) are favorable.

**Marked Left Ventricular Enlargement** LV enlargement is a risk factor for death early after repair (see Table 11-8). Presumably, marked LV enlargement connotes reduced ventricular contractility (see "Mitral Regurgitation" under Natural History earlier in this section), and this may actually be responsible for increased risk.

**Left Atrial Enlargement** Surprisingly, large size of the left atrium is a risk factor for poor outcome that approaches the risk imposed by LV enlargement.R12

**Ischemic Mitral Regurgitation** Ischemic etiology is a greater risk factor for death late after mitral valve replacement than nonischemic etiology.

**Advanced Functional Disability** Expressed as NYHA functional class, advanced disability is an important risk factor for death in the early phase of hazardB10,B11,B26,F3,G33,P10,T6,W7 (see Table 11-8). In large part, this correlation is associated with the relation between functional status and left and right ventricular contractility.H17 The effect of preoperative functional class interacts with other incremental risk factors as well. Neutralization of this risk factor depends on providing better intraoperative myocardial management for already damaged ventricles and preventing patients from reaching NYHA functional class IV or V before surgical intervention. Nonetheless, patients with mitral valve disease who have depressed left or right ventricular contractility appear to have better survival after surgical treatment than with continued medical treatment.H17

**Global Myocardial Ischemic Time** Prolonged global myocardial ischemic time using cold cardioplegia is an incremental risk factor for death in the early phase after operation.B26,F3 This can be seen from predicted 30-day mortality of 6% or less when global myocardial ischemic time is 120 minutes or shorter (Fig. 11-39). Almost all mitral valve operations, including those with concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and tricuspid anuloplasty, can be accomplished within that time.

Incremental risks of concomitant tricuspid anuloplasty and CABG are discussed separately under "Results" in Sections II and III.

**Devices** No device currently in use has been clearly shown to be a risk factor for premature death after mitral valve replacement.B26 Earlier, the "high profile" of caged-ball valves was alleged to be an incremental risk factor because of its supposed obstructive effect and detrimental effect on LV function. This may have been true, in view of the superior early results from 1970 to 1973 using a stent-mounted aortic allograft valve, suggesting that a nonobstructive device with a central orifice flow pattern is optimal. Also, at least in the experience of Cohn and colleagues, survival after mitral valve replacement with a bioprosthesis of any type was higher than after replacement with a prosthetic disc valve, perhaps related

*P* value for nonischemic mitral regurgitation = .098.

Concomitant CABG was not a risk factor.

to fewer thromboembolic events and only infrequent anticoagulation in the former group<sup>C28</sup> (see "Mechanical Mitral Valve Replacement Devices" and "Bioprosthetic Mitral Valve Replacement Devices" later in this section).

Previous closed or open mitral valve repair or percutaneous balloon valvotomy cannot be considered incremental risk factors.

#### Cardiac Performance

Left AV valve function usually is greatly improved, but a transvalvar end-diastolic gradient is present in most patients following mitral valve replacement. G19,15 Magnitude of the gradient depends on patient size and physical activity (e.g., cardiac output at rest and during exercise), size of device inserted, and its type. Gradients are small when devices larger than 29 mm can be used, but they vary according to the device and are typically present with 29-mm, 27-mm, and 25-mm sizes (Table 11-9). Zero-pressure fixation techniques may improve the performance of porcine bioprostheses by making the leaflets more pliable.

Response of LV performance to valve replacement in patients with mitral stenosis who have impaired function preoperatively has not been determined, but the abnormalities of compliance (which this type of impairment usually induces) probably remain.

Sudden ablation of mitral regurgitation by mitral valve replacement triggers a particularly complex LV response (see "Mitral Regurgitation" under Natural History earlier in this section). D14,K15,R5 If the LV is normal, as usually occurs in acute experimental or clinical regurgitation, sudden correction of regurgitation immediately increases forward flow (cardiac output) despite increased afterload. After valve replacement for *chronic* mitral regurgitation, however, EF is lower, at least transiently, than preoperatively in most patients. B5,S10 When preoperative LV enlargement is only mild or moderate (with an end-diastolic dimension of 7 cm or less and an end-systolic dimension of 5 cm or less by echocardiography. reduced EF after valve replacement generally remains within the normal range.

In patients with a more than moderately enlarged LV at operation (with an echocardiographically determined

end-diastolic dimension > 7 cm or an end-systolic dimension > 5 cm<sup>\$10</sup>), a condition accompanied by decreased LV contractility and increased myocardial degenerative changes, EF is greatly reduced 2 weeks after valve replacement and at times deteriorates still further during the later postoperative period.

Patients undergoing effective repair have generally better ejection indices postoperatively than similarly matched candidates after valve replacement. Tischler and colleagues reported reduction of rest and exercise EFs in 10 mitral replacement subjects, but no change in repair patients. The Repair patients had a higher stroke volume and EF at rest and exercise, associated with lower end-systolic wall stress.

LV enlargement regresses after operation, with both end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions returning toward normal. S10 LV contractility is probably normal or near normal preoperatively and remains so after operation. K10,S10 In many patients, however, LV size is reduced early postoperatively (end-diastolic volume is less, and end-systolic volume is about the same), but increases late postoperatively (6-12 months after operation). S10 LV wall hypertrophy does not regress. S10 In such patients, the preoperative LV structural and contractile abnormalities not only show *no regression* after valve replacement but in fact *progress* and account for many recurrences of symptoms 2 to 5 years postoperatively and for many deaths 2 to 10 years postoperatively.

These findings apply to conventional mitral valve replacement in which the tensor apparatus (chordae tendineae) of the native valve is excised or transected (see "Chordal Sparing" under Technique of Operation earlier in this section). Experiments by Miller and colleagues have demonstrated that chordal division results in deterioration of LV systolic function in both isovolumic and ejecting heart preparations. H5-H7 These observations were extended to animals with surgically induced mitral regurgitation. Y5 Mitral valve replacement was performed with all chordae tendineae intact; LV systolic function was then assessed and subsequently remeasured after division of the chordae. Endsystolic pressure volume (E<sub>es</sub>) and end-systolic stress volume (M<sub>s</sub>) relationships decreased by 46% and 36% when the chordae were divided (P = .001 and .0001, respectively), indicating deterioration in LV energetics and mechanical efficiency (Fig. 11-40).

Miller termed the effect of an intact tensor apparatus on optimal global ventricular function "valvular-ventricular interaction."H5 Deterioration of function after division of the chordae resulted from an exacerbated mismatch of ventriculararterial coupling with increased load-resisting shortening. In fact, chordal sparing was first suggested by Lillehei in 1964, L12 then later disputed by some. R8 However, David and colleagues in 1983 and later Daenen, Miki, Goor, and Hennein and their colleagues produced clinical results suggesting that chordal sparing during mitral valve replacement improved hospital survival and global LV function. D1,D9,G21,H11,M23 Carabello's group again documented preservation of systolic ejection performance in mitral valve replacement with intact tensor apparatus compared with otherwise similar mitral valve replacement patients without chordal preservation. R27 Preservation resulted in postoperative decrease in diastolic volume, reduced end-systolic stress, and no reduction of ejection indices. In analogous experiments in dogs, these investigators found individual myocyte contractile function normal when global contractile indices

returned to normal after chordal-sparing mitral valve replacement.I3 Others have subsequently demonstrated a beneficial effect of chordal sparing on LV performance following mitral valve replacement for regurgitation.D10,M29,O3,S33

Although long-term survival and ventricular function are not yet known, it is apparent that some form of chordal continuity is desirable in mitral valve replacement for regurgitation.

from elevated left atrial pressure and elevated Rp. Increased Rp may have both a *dynamic* element, which is immediately decreased by reducing left atrial pressure,D2 and an *organic* element, which results from pulmonary vascular disease that may or may not regress after operation. Thus, even severe pulmonary hypertension will likely regress toward normal after mitral valve replacement. Kaul and colleagues reported on 30 patients with average preoperative pulmonary artery pressures of 110 mmHg systolic and 74 mmHg mean.K6 Symptomatic improvement was striking. Restudy an average of 5.5 years after mitral valve replacement showed an average systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 48 mmHg and a mean of 31 mmHg. This drop often occurs soon after valve replacement and thus seems related largely to sudden reduction of left atrial pressure and reversal of severe spastic pulmonary vasoconstriction that accompanies left atrial hypertension in some patients.B37 Although this initial reduction appears rapidly in most patients,B37,D2 Rp may continue to fall further in the months after operation. The changes are similar in operations performed for stenosis and for regurgitation.B37

Information derived from patients having balloon mitral valvotomy confirms these surgical observations. Immediately after valvotomy, pulmonary artery systolic pressure decreases, but no important change occurs in Rp. One year after the procedure, most patients experience a further decrease of pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and Rp decreases. In older patients and those with atrial fibrillation, normalization of Rp occurs less frequently.F1,G6

#### *Thromboembolism*

Table 11-10 shows the incidence of thromboembolism reported for selected mechanical and bioprosthetic valves (Fig. 11-41). In general, the incidence is somewhat less with bioprostheses.E2 The incidence and importance of thromboembolism and anticoagulant-related hemorrhage are sufficient to have unfavorable effects on the life expectancy of patients with mechanical valves.

Adequacy of warfarin therapy appears to be the most important determinant of the rate of thromboembolism in patients with mechanical valves in the mitral position. With bioprostheses, warfarin therapy for 3 months or aspirin indefinitely appear to be as effective as long-term warfarin therapy.E2

#### *Acute Thrombotic Occlusion*

Acute thrombotic occlusion of a mitral prosthesis occurs more often with a mechanical device (3 per 100 patient-years) than with a bioprosthesis (1.9 per 100 patient-years)E2 (see "Mechanical Mitral Valve Replacement Devices" later in this section).

The problem in using linearized rates is well exemplified in the case of acute thrombotic occlusion. Linearized rates assume a constant hazard function (see "General Comments" under Time-Related Events in Chapter 6). However, at least in the case of the Bjork-Shiley tilting-disc valve, the hazard function for this event had a single peaking phase that returned to a low level by 4 years after operation.B26 In addition to the scientific importance of this finding, the shape of

Vertical axis is linearized rate in units of percent per year (equivalent to events per 100 patient-years). Each symbol represents one series; height of symbol represents point estimate of event rate, and vertical bars show 95% confidence intervals. Series are grouped on the horizontal axis by valve model, shown below the axis by a two-letter abbreviation. Lower horizontal dashed line indicates the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Objective Performance Criteria (OPC). For approval of a new valve, the upper confidence limit should be less than twice the OPC *(upper dashed line)*. Circles indicate that only late events were used to calculate the rates; diamonds indicate that both early and late events were used.

the hazard function and a limited clinical experience supports the use of thrombectomy (through both the left atrium and aorta) rather than valve replacement.

Acute thrombotic occlusion occurs primarily but not exclusively in patients receiving suboptimal anticoagulant therapy. A possible risk factor is female gender. Patients with this catastrophic complication usually become symptomatic only 1 to 3 days before admission to the hospital and present principally with extreme dyspnea and orthopnea. The patient may have noticed a decrease in intensity of prosthetic valve sounds about the time symptoms began. Many experience chest pain, and signs of shock usually appear. Although regurgitation is often present, an apical systolic murmur is rarely heard. A fluoroscopic finding of limited disc movement supports the diagnosis, but an echocardiogram is diagnostic.B16 Cardiac catheterization usually gives conclusive evidence of mitral obstruction, but such patients are usually too ill to withstand this procedure.C32 Emergency operation is indicated. Surgical thrombectomy often achieves a good result.M28 Thrombolysis has been used with mixed results (see previous text and "Thrombosis" under Results in Chapter 14).

#### *Complications of Long-Term Anticoagulation*

Complications of long-term anticoagulation with warfarin or warfarin-like compounds appear to be independent of type of prosthesis. Certainly the quality of the surveillance program for patients receiving long-term anticoagulation affects both freedom from anticoagulant-related hemorrhage and prevalence of thromboembolic complications. Percentage freedom from first anticoagulant-related hemorrhage at 5, 10, and 15 years is about 87%, 79%, and 71%, respectively. Linearized rate of important hemorrhage is generally estimated to average 2.3 to 3.4 per 100 patient-years in patients with mechanical prostheses who are taking warfarin,C36,C44,E2,M24,T3 although a recent meta-analysis suggests a lower rate of 1% to 2% per year.G32 Many hemorrhagic episodes are relatively minor and do not require hospitalization and transfusion. Miller and colleagues found about one third of hemorrhagic events to be fatal.M24

There is no evidence that the hazard function for a bleeding event in a patient on warfarin therapy is anything other than a single constant phase, but this has not been rigorously studied.

Warfarin has a number of serious effects during pregnancy. It crosses the placenta and in about 10% of patients causes warfarin embryopathy if the fetus is exposed between the sixth and ninth weeks of gestation. If warfarin is taken during the second and third trimesters, optic atrophy and mental retardation occur in the fetus in about 3% of cases. Overall, miscarriage occurs in 70% to 75% of pregnancies when the mother has taken warfarin since conception.E2

#### *Prosthetic Valve Endocarditis*

Prosthetic valve endocarditis2 is an uncommon but serious complication that results in the death of more than half of affected patients.D17,I5 Endocarditis strongly predisposes the patient to periprosthetic leakage.B26,D17 When it appears within 3 to 6 months of operation, prosthetic valve endocarditis is probably related to events in the operating room.I5 When it develops later, it probably results from a new bacteremia (infective endocarditis is covered in detail in Chapter 15).

When mitral prosthetic infection becomes evident within 6 months of implantation, prosthetic leakage is likely to occur, and the risk of death is high. Intense antibiotic treatment followed by early prosthetic replacement in most patients is indicated. The organism and its antibiotic sensitivity should be identified and specific therapy used. In the unusual circumstance of excellent response to antibiotics, no evidence of peripheral embolization, and no evidence of periprosthetic leakage, reoperation may be deferred. The patient is followed closely under hospital conditions that permit immediate reoperation in the event any of these complications occur. When mitral prosthetic infection becomes apparent for the first time more than 6 months postoperatively, the same management protocols apply. More of these patients respond well to intense medical treatment alone than those with infections occurring in the first 6 months after operation.

#### *Periprosthetic Leakage*

At UAB in an era when various suture techniques were used (1975 to July 1979), 13 of 452 (2.9%; CL 2.1%-3.9%) patients required reoperation for periprosthetic leakage. Currently, the incidence in uninfected patients approaches zero

*Prosthetic valve endocarditis* and its abbreviation *PVE* are familiar, standard, and historical designations for infective endocarditis on any heart valve substitute. The rationale for a more appropriate term, *replacement device endocarditis*, is presented in Chapter 12.

when suture techniques described in this chapter are used.D17 Preoperative infective endocarditis increases risk of prosthesis dehiscence with periprosthetic leakage.R19 Anular calcification also increases risk.D17

#### *Chronic Hemolysis*

Well-functioning bioprosthetic and mechanical prostheses used in the current era rarely produce more than mild chronic hemolysis unless periprosthetic leakage is present.A7 With periprosthetic leakage, hemolysis may be severe with any device; red cell trauma and fragmentation may be extreme under these circumstances. A mechanical prosthesis of small size relative to body size and hemodynamics may result in severe hemolysis.N7

#### *Functional Status*

Symptoms are reduced and functional capacity increased in most patients.W7 However, prevalence of an excellent functional status after replacement is related to preoperative functional class. Only about half of patients with severe preoperative chronic functional disability return to NYHA functional class I. This finding suggests that many patients with mitral valve disease and advanced chronic disability have a secondary irreversible ventricular myopathy. Infrequently, a patient may display striking symptomatic improvement for 2 to 5 years, after which important symptoms and disability gradually reappear despite good function of the prosthetic device. This sequence is believed to result from progression of a secondary cardiomyopathy that was present before operation or occasionally from progression of other valve lesions.

#### *Reoperation*

Reoperation, usually for periprosthetic leakage with or without infectious endocarditis or for bioprosthetic degeneration, has been required within 5 years of the original operation in about 5% of patients. Prevalence, and particularly the hazard function for reoperation, are different for mechanical and bioprosthetic devices; only bioprostheses exhibit degeneration and a late-rising hazard function (Fig. 11-42). Risk of death after reoperation, both early and intermediate term

(see Fig. 11-38), as well as the risk of reoperation, subsequent prosthetic valve endocarditis, and periprosthetic leakage, increases with each succeeding reoperation.B26,G33

#### *Summary*

Although not free of complications in all patients, mitral valve replacement provides a considerably better prognosis than could be expected according to natural history. About 70% of patients are alive and without complications for at least 5 years after valve replacement.

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION, SELECTION OF TECHNIQUE, AND CHOICE OF DEVICE

#### Mitral Stenosis

Patients with mitral stenosis and at least NYHA class II symptoms of heart failure should be considered for medical, interventional, or surgical therapy based on clinical, echocardiographic, and catheterization considerations. Useful algorithms for NYHA class II patients (Fig. 11-43) and class III and IV patients (Fig. 11-44) have been developed by the ACC/AHA.B31 When an opening snap is prominent, when calcification cannot be demonstrated fluoroscopically, and when echocardiography demonstrates pliable leaflets and little or no subvalvar narrowing, good results from surgical mitral commissurotomy can usually be obtained. Under these circumstances, even mild symptoms (NYHA functional class II) in the presence of severe mitral stenosis are an indication for intervention (see Fig. 11-43). Percutaneous balloon mitral commissurotomy is often chosen,B1 although surgical commissurotomy is a reasonable alternative. Particularly in young women, one acute episode of important paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or pulmonary edema in the presence of at least moderate mitral stenosis is an indication for intervention. It is particularly indicated before onset of atrial fibrillation.S24 Intervention is also advisable when there is an important increase in Rp, even in the absence of symptoms. Asymptomatic patients with recurrent episodes of arterial emboli while receiving adequate anticoagulation are advised to undergo intervention if commissurotomy is a strong possibilityB31; in this setting and in the presence of demonstrated thrombi in the left atrium, open surgical commissurotomy is advisable.

When mitral valve replacement seems likely (because of absence of an opening snap, immobile leaflets, heavy mitral valve calcification, severe subvalvar disease,A11 or associated mitral regurgitation), a more symptomatic state is demanded as the indication for operation because of the added longterm imponderables introduced by the device inserted; these would be more severe chronic symptoms (NYHA functional class III or higher) or several acute episodes of symptoms of pulmonary venous hypertension.

Advanced disability, associated tricuspid valve disease, and associated coronary artery disease are not contraindications to operation, nor is severe pulmonary hypertension.

#### Mitral Regurgitation

At operation, mitral valve repair rather than replacement is chosen whenever possible: in 50% to 70% of all patients and in up to 90% of patients with mitral valve prolapse.E13,H9,S30 Repair avoids the potential complications of long-term

**Figure 11-43** Management strategy for patients with mitral stenosis and mild symptoms. Mitral valve area (MVA) measurements may vary, and mean transmitral gradient, pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) should also be taken into consideration. There is controversy regarding whether patients with severe mitral stenosis (MVA < 1 cm2 ) and severe pulmonary hypertension (PASP > 60 to 80 mmHg) should undergo percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (PMBV) or mitral valve replacement (MVR) to prevent right ventricular failure.

anticoagulation and prosthesis-related complications and likely provides greater survival benefit in most patient subsets.D4

Operation (mitral valve repair when feasible) is clearly advisable when mitral regurgitation is severe and the patient has NYHA functional class III or IV symptoms of heart failure with LV enlargement or mild to moderate LV dysfunction.

Although continued medical management has traditionally been recommended for patients with chronic severe mitral regurgitation, NYHA functional class I or II symptoms, and normal or mildly abnormal LV size and function, recent natural history studies of severe degenerative mitral regurgitation have highlighted the unfavorable long-term outcome with nonsurgical therapy (see Natural History, Mitral Regurgitation earlier in this section). Several studies have identified reparative mitral valve surgery as an independent predictor of late survival and freedom from cardiovascular events.G26,L14 Echocardiography, particularly TEE, can accurately predict specific mitral valve lesions and the functional anatomy of mitral regurgitation (88%-99% overall accuracy in the Mayo Clinic experience).E13 Moreover, echocardiographic anatomic and physiologic classification is a strong predictor of valve reparability, operative mortality, and long-term outcome.

Patients with mitral regurgitation may remain asymptomatic or may have only mild symptoms associated with longstanding disease and gradually deteriorating LV function because of the mitigating effect of regurgitant mitral flow on LV systolic function, reflected in EF. Thus, whereas the diagnosis and symptoms of mitral stenosis generally provide sufficient evidence for decision making, special attention must also be paid to the status of the LV in mitral regurgitation. A decline in LV contractility, assessed by end-systolic pressurevolume relationships or a similar method, portends a state of irreversibility and may be used to advise operation in relatively asymptomatic patients. Additionally, operation in most of these asymptomatic patients is well advised if repair is probable, because it has been well documented that postoperative systolic and diastolic LV function are preserved after mitral valve reconstruction.C35,S1

Reference has been made to more sophisticated methods of assessing the functional state of the LV in patients with mitral regurgitation (see "Mitral Regurgitation" under Natural History). Zile, Schuler, and their colleagues identified groups of patients with elevated end-diastolic dimensions, elevated systolic dimensions, and low-normal LVEF in whom symptoms were not relieved, heart failure was persistent, or high mortality followed operation.S10,Z1 If LV endsystolic dimension exceeded 26 mm · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> body surface area (BSA) and fractional shortening was less than 31%, consistent deterioration of LV function occurred postoperatively.Z1 Based on these findings, Ross has suggested operating on patients with few or no symptoms if LVEF is less than 55%, fractional shortening is less than 30%, and end-systolic diameter approaches 50 mm (26 mm · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> BSA).R25 These

**Figure 11-44** Management strategy for patients with mitral stenosis and moderate to severe symptoms. Mitral valve area (MVA) measurements may vary, and mean transmitral gradient, pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) should also be taken into consideration. There is controversy regarding which patients with less favorable valve morphology should undergo percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (PMBV) rather than mitral valve surgery.

recommendations were reaffirmed in the *ACC/AHA Practice Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Valvular Heart Disease*, which recommends operation for asymptomatic severe mitral regurgitation in patients with LVEF less than 60% and LV end-systolic dimension greater than 40 mm.B32 Further evidence of contractile dysfunction in the presence of severe mitral regurgitation and normal EF was reported by Ahmed and colleagues,A8 who noted evidence of myofibrillar degeneration on LV biopsy and persistence of wall stress/volume index abnormalities following mitral valve repair.

The magnitude of regurgitant volume may also refine the timing of intervention. Yamano and colleaguesY2 noted a strong correlation between large regurgitant volume and the likelihood of postoperative LV dysfunction (see "Cardiac Performance" under Results of Mitral Valve Repair in the Results section). Thus, if mitral valve pathology is such that successful repair is highly likely, operation is probably advisable if mitral regurgitant volume exceeds 80 mL before the onset of other established criteria for operation. Based on natural history studies, Enriquez-Sarano and colleagues from the Mayo Clinic recommended consideration for mitral repair in asymptomatic patients with an effective regurgitant orifice (by echocardiography) exceeding 40 mm2 .

Diminished response of EF with exercise also has been found to predict postoperative LV dysfunction.L10 Thus, failure to increase EF with exercise is an indication for surgical intervention if severe mitral regurgitation is present and repair appears likely.

The role of left atrial enlargement in decision making is uncertain. More than moderate left atrial dilatation likely has a deleterious effect after valve repair or replacement and therefore favors operation.R12

The recommendation for early operation (assuming mitral valve repair is highly likely) in the asymptomatic patient with severe mitral regurgitation secondary to degenerative disease and normal LV function is supported by data from a European multicenter study (see also "Natural History of Mitral Regurgitation" earlier in this section).G26 Early operation (within 1 year of diagnosis) resulted in an important reduction in subsequent heart failure and combined heart failure/ cardiovascular mortality (Fig. 11-45).

The updated 2006 ACC/AHA guidelines also recommend that mitral valve repair be considered in asymptomatic patients with severe mitral regurgitation and preserved LV size and function in the presence of new-onset atrial fibrillation or pulmonary artery systolic pressure greater than 50 mmHg at rest or greater than 60 with exercise.B31

The adverse natural history of severe mitral regurgitation secondary to mitral valve prolapse with flail leafletE12,G25,G26,L14 supports this condition as an isolated indication for operation, even in asymptomatic patients. The decision to recommend

**Figure 11-45** Time-dependent analysis in asymptomatic patients with severe mitral regurgitation and normal ventricular function (*n* = 102) (after adjusting for age) shows favorable associations between prompt surgery (vs. no or delayed surgery) and heart failure and the combined endpoint heart failure/cardiovascular death (only cardiovascular death failed to reach statistical significance). Mitral valve repair in asymptomatic patients with normal ventricular function seems to prevent cardiac morbidity. Prompt surgery was defined as an operation performed less than 12 months after echocardiography (delayed surgery was longer than 12 months). Point estimates of hazard ratios are graphically depicted as circles, with their 95% CI *(lines)*. Key: *HR,* Hazard ratio; *MV,* mitral valve. (From Grigioni and colleagues.G26)

operation in the subset of patients with mild or no symptoms is predicated on the assumption that a successful valve repair with mild or less postoperative mitral regurgitation can be accomplished with a likelihood of 90% or higher. Therefore, asymptomatic patients with severe mitral regurgitation and a *floppy valve* (prolapse as opposed to ischemic or restrictive functional anatomy) are excellent candidates for early operation, because operative mortality is low (<2%), reparability high (90%), and long-term survival good.E13,L13 In the case of chronic severe mitral regurgitation, the 2006 ACC/AHA guidelines present an algorithm for decision making that includes mitral valve repair for asymptomatic patients with preserved LV size and function (Fig. 11-46).

At the other end of the functional spectrum, advanced disability with NYHA functional class IV heart failure is not a contraindication to operation, although it is recognized that secondary LV myopathy associated with, and in part responsible for, this state has a deleterious effect on early and late results of operation. The 2006 ACC/AHA guidelines recommend that mitral valve repair be considered for patients with chronic severe mitral regurgitation secondary to severe LV dysfunction (EF < 30%) in the setting of NYHA functional class III or IV symptoms despite optimal therapy for heart failure, including biventricular pacing.B31 If a stage of irreversibility can be securely identified by preoperative studies, valve surgery may be ineffective and cardiac replacement indicated.

Elderly patients with mitral regurgitation require special consideration because operative mortality is increased and late survival benefit reduced for patients older than about age 75 years, especially those with concomitant coronary artery diseaseE3,G20 (see "Older Age" under Incremental Risk Factors for Premature Death in the Results section). The increased operative risk is worth accepting in elderly patients with important symptoms that limit their quality of life. Otherwise, medical therapy is advisable.

#### *Nonischemic Chordal Rupture*

The decision about operation is more difficult in patients with mitral regurgitation from nonischemic chordal rupture of recent onset. If the symptoms of pulmonary venous hypertension are brought promptly under control by medical management, as often occurs, operation may be deferred and the patient reevaluated at frequent intervals (see Natural History earlier in this section). Thereafter, the criteria used in chronic mitral regurgitation apply. If the pansystolic murmur radiates into the aortic area and neck, however, and if echocardiographic evidence shows that the ruptured chordae belong to the posterior leaflet, indications for operation should be liberalized because a durable reparative operation can be done at low risk.

#### *Infective Endocarditis*

Mitral regurgitation may develop acutely as a result of infective endocarditis. If symptoms are initially mild or moderate and are brought under good control together with the infection, continuing in-hospital medical treatment is indicated. Surveillance must be close, however, because of possible rapid progression in severity of regurgitation. If this is suspected, operation is urgently indicated before hemodynamic deterioration occurs. Acute pulmonary edema, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or rising blood urea nitrogen or creatinine levels are indications for urgent operation. Systemic embolization during treatment or persistent active infection despite intense antibiotic treatment also indicate the need for operation (see Chapter 15).

#### Mixed Mitral Stenosis and Regurgitation

Patients with a mixture of important stenosis and mitral regurgitation usually have a clinical picture similar to that of patients with pure mitral stenosis. Valve replacement is usually required, and indications for operation are the same as in mitral stenosis.

#### Selection of Technique for Repair of Mitral Regurgitation

Anular dilation is a central feature of degenerative mitral regurgitation, and therefore reduction anuloplasty is a standard component of most repairs. However, particularly in an era when percutaneous techniques for mitral valve repair (which do not include reduction anuloplasty) are being introduced, it is useful to consider situations in which reduction anuloplasty might not be needed. Maisano and colleagues used the concept of anular-to-leaflet mismatch to identify anular dilatation. The ratio of the septolateral (SL) dimension (distance between midpoint of the anterior mitral leaflet at the anulus to midpoint of the posterior leaflet at the anulus, measured during systole via TTE) to the anterior leaflet height (ALH) was used to define anular-to-leaflet mismatch. A ratio of SL/ALH greater than 1.4 corresponded to patients whose mitral anulus was reduced more than 20% by

the anuloplasty procedure, which was termed "reductive." "Nonreductive" anuloplasties (SL/ALH < 1.4) occurred in less than 20% of patients. M1 Although good results have been reported following mitral valve repair without ring anuloplasty, B6 the general consensus would favor placing a reductive partial or complete anuloplasty ring in patients with an enlarged anulus. By inference, less than 20% of patients with degenerative mitral valve disease would be expected to receive maximal benefit from techniques (including current percutaneous strategies) that do not include an anuloplasty ring. This inference is supported by a propensity-matched analysis by Gillinov and colleagues that demonstrated an accelerated return of mitral regurgitation when mitral valve repair was performed without an anuloplasty band or ring. G17

#### Coexisting Mild Aortic Stenosis

A number of patients treated by percutaneous or surgical valvotomy for mitral stenosis have mild aortic involvement at the time of the procedure. Most do not progress to severe disease even after long follow-up, and aortic valve replacement is rarely needed. Thus, at initial mitral operation, prophylactic aortic valve replacement is not indicated. V2

#### Choice of Device for Valve Replacement

Some surgeons routinely use one device or another for mitral valve replacement, but the valve of choice varies widely. Rabago and Cooley and others have reviewed a number of factors involved in the choice of device. G32,K3,R24 Two of the most important considerations are durability and requirement for permanent anticoagulation.

Currently available xenograft bioprostheses degenerate more rapidly in young patients who would otherwise be good surgical candidates for tissue valves. Alvanced age and atrial fibrillation increase the probability of thromboembolism even in patients with bioprostheses. Also, Warnes and colleagues reported that bioprostheses degenerate more rapidly in the mitral position than in the aortic position. Bioprostheses are in a state of evolution; continuing improvements will probably lead to increased durability. C10

Prosthetic mechanical valves are also evolving, but there is no evidence that a device that does not require lifelong anticoagulation will soon be available. Hemodynamic characteristics and performance of the mitral valve prosthesis may also influence choices, particularly in very young patients.

For patients undergoing mitral valve replacement, the basic decision is whether to use a mechanical valve or a bioprosthesis. In patients older than about 60 years, survival may be better with a bioprosthesis because of thromboembolic and anticoagulant-related problems associated with mechanical valves. Also, reoperation 7 to 15 years later may be preferable to lifelong anticoagulant (warfarin) therapy. In patients younger than age 60, survival may be better with a mechanical valve because of the more rapid degeneration of bioprostheses in the young, despite need for lifelong anticoagulation. Infrequently, a bioprosthesis is used in young women, with anticipated replacement after successful childbearing (see "Complications of Long-Term Anticoagulation" later in this section).

The newest approach to mitral valve substitute devices is use of a cryopreserved stentless allograft. Early reports suggest good hemodynamic performance and adequate freedom from thromboembolism (in the absence of anticoagulation).A4 The important issue is durability. There are also scattered reports describing placement of a pulmonary valve autograft in the mitral position. The valve is implanted as a cylinder ("top hat") using two suture lines augmented with an atrial cuff.G10,R24

#### *Mechanical Mitral Valve Replacement Devices*

The design of mechanical valve prostheses has evolved over the last 5 decades. A discussion of modern mechanical valves is complicated by two factors: (1) changing availability of specific valves because of continuing introduction and withdrawal of new models and (2) variability in prevalence of use in different countries, in part because of differing regulatory requirements. Here we discuss mechanical valves currently available and in use in at least several countries.

The major types of mechanical heart valves available are ball and cage (rarely used now), tilting disc, and bileaflet valves. Disc valves contain struts attached to the valve orifice (together called the *valve housing*) that guide and retain the occluder disc. Tilting disc valves contain a disc generally constructed from graphite with a coating of pyrolytic carbon. The valve opening is separated into two areas designated the major and minor orifices.

Bileaflet valves have variable design features, but all contain two leaflets that swing apart during opening, providing three separate flow areas. The leaflets are guided by a hinge or pivot mechanism that acts to retain the leaflets and defines their opening angle. Nearly all valves are rotatable following implantation to address potential impingement on leaflet closure by surrounding tissues.

Current mechanical valve design has focused on excellent hemodynamics, lifetime durability, and maximal resistance to thromboembolism. Transvalvar gradients are determined by orifice diameter, occluder characteristics, the opening angle, and leaflet or occluder orientation to the plane of the mitral orifice. A wide opening angle generally improves the effective orifice area and decreases the diastolic pressure gradient. Dynamic regurgitation is a feature of all mechanical prosthetic valves and is increased with larger effective orifice size and time needed for leaflet or disc closure. A small regurgitant volume is beneficial because it minimizes stasis and decreases platelet aggregation.

The *Starr-Edwards (S-E) mitral ball-valve prosthesis* (model 6120; Fig. 11-47), no longer available in the United States, was introduced in its current design in 1965. The occluder is a barium-impregnated silicone elastomer ball in a

cobalt-chromium alloy cage. The sewing ring has a silicone rubber insert under seamless PTFE or polyester cloth.

Diastolic gradients across S-E prosthetic mitral valves in vivo are slightly greater, and effective orifice area slightly less, than for other available mechanical valves. No firm evidence indicates that projection of the valve cage into the LV is functionally disadvantageous, except when the ventricle is unusually small.

Thromboembolism is probably more common with the S-E valve than with other valves and more common after mitral valve replacement than after aortic valve replacement (see Table 11-10 and Fig. 11-41). The linearized rate of valve thrombosis in the mitral position is very low, about 0.2% per patient-year.

Mechanical failures in the current S-E silicone elastomer ball-valve prosthesis in the mitral position have not been reported. The valve is provided in sizes 5M (34 mm), 4M (32 mm), 3M (30 mm), 2M (28 mm), 1M (26 mm), 0M (22 mm), and 00M (20 mm).

The *Bjork-Shiley Monostrut valve* (Fig. 11-48), introduced in April 1982, is commonly used in Europe but is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

for use in the United States. Earlier versions of the valve are no longer available. B22 Its orifice ring and integral struts are constructed from a cobalt-chromium alloy as a single piece. The pyrolytic carbon convexo-concave disc opens to 70 degrees. Hemodynamics are good S3 (see Table 11-9). Available information suggests that in the mitral position, the valve has a relatively low rate of thromboembolism (see Table 11-10 and Fig. 11-41). Daenen and colleagues found that freedom from thromboembolism was  $86\% \pm 4\%$  at 6 years. It is provided in odd-numbered external diameter sizes from 17 to 33 mm.

The *Omniscience tilting-disc valve* (Fig. 11-49) is an FDA-approved valve introduced in 1978 and distributed world-wide. It is a second-generation device based on modifications of the Lillehei-Kaster pivoting-disc valve. The pivoting occluder device consists of a free-floating convexo-concave disc of pyrolytic carbon within a one-piece titanium housing. The disc opens to 80 degrees. Hemodynamic performance is similar to that of other tilting-disc valves.

Thromboembolic complications have been the subject of considerable controversy. R1 Several investigators have found linearized rates of thromboembolism to be higher with the Omniscience valve than with other mechanical prostheses, E1 but others have found the rate to be low. D16 The linearized rate of valve thrombosis was  $3.1\% \pm 1.1\%$  per patient-year, higher (P = .01) than for Medtronic-Hall and Bjork-Shiley tilting-disc valves. Scotten and colleagues found a smaller regurgitant volume with the Omniscience valve than with some other devices. S12 Thus, Cortina and colleagues have hypothesized that a lesser degree of self-washing by this prosthesis explains its seemingly higher propensity for valve thrombosis. C36 It is provided in external diameter sizes of 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, and 33 mm for implantation in the mitral position.

The successor to the Omniscience valve is the Omnicarbon valve. The Omnicarbon monoleaflet valve has a Pyrolyte carbon housing rather than titanium, which is associated with a reduction in thromboembolism and valve thrombosis. W3 No case of mechanical failure has been reported.

The St. Jude Medical (SJM) mitral valve (Fig. 11-50), available worldwide and approved for use in the United States by the FDA, was first implanted in October 1977. It is a bileaflet device, and both the leaflets and orifice ring are fabricated from pyrolytic carbon. The leaflets are orifice oriented, and closing forces are supported by a pivot system.

The pivot guards are raised above the housing, and leaflet motion is by rotation. Two relatively high-velocity regurgitant jets (seen on echocardiography) wash the pivot recess, producing approximately 10% regurgitation. The original SJM was not rotatable, but the newer Masters Series allows rotation to an "anatomic" or "anti-anatomic" position of the leaflets. The sewing cuff on the mitral prosthesis has a supraanular configuration and is provided in a standard (M-101) or expanded (MEC-102) polyester fiber cuff. It is also available with a PTFE fiber cuff (MT-103). Hemodynamic performance is excellent, as reflected in a relatively large effective orifice area. The favorable hemodynamics in the smaller sizes is an advantage in small children. Regurgitant flow may be greater than optimal, particularly at low heart rates.<sup>R7</sup> Between 88% and 96% of patients with device placement in the mitral position are free from a thromboembolic event at 5 years after operation (Fig. 11-51; see Table 11-10). Linearized rate of the first thromboembolic event is about 1.5% to 1.75% per patient-year. B13,E2,J3 Up to 75% of thromboembolic episodes occur when anticoagulation is inadequate (INR < 2.5).<sup>13</sup> Thrombosis is uncommon. Incidence is approximately 0.1% per patient-year and is usually associated with inadequate anticoagulation. 12 Mechanical failure is uncommon. The SJM

mitral valve is provided in sizes 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, and 33 mm.

The *CarboMedics mitral valve* (Fig. 11-52) is a low-profile bileaflet prosthesis constructed of Pyrolite carbon. It has been in use since 1985 and was approved by the FDA in 1992. The leaflet retention mechanism is within the Pyrolyte housing and has no pivot guards, struts, or orifice projections. Leaflet motion is by rotation, with relatively complete seating but allowing four small regurgitant jets (typically noted on echocardiography). The valve housing is rotatable within a carbon-coated polyester sewing ring. A modification of the sewing ring in another model (CarboMedics Optiform) allows flexibility in supra- or subanular implantation. The valve has a favorable record for freedom from *thromboembolism*, with about 93% of patients event-free at 3 years (see Table 11-10 and Fig. 11-51), and the linearized rate of thromboembolism 1.0% to 2.5% per patient-yearJ3 (see Fig. 11-41). Thrombosis is uncommon. Prevalence is approximately 0.5 per 100 patient-years.A9 Hemodynamics are generally good with this valve, but the 25-mm CarboMedics valve has been found to have a higher diastolic gradient than other bileaflet prostheses, especially at high flows. This valve is not recommended for patients with a small mitral valve orifice.B46 The mitral device is provided in sizes 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, and 29 mm.

The *Medtronic ATS valve* is a bileaflet valve (Fig. 11-53) that has been in clinical use in the United States since 2000.

**Figure 11-54** On-X mechanical mitral valve prosthesis.

This solid pyrolytic carbon valve has a unique pivot design in which the pivot areas are entirely within the orifice ring, and the valve leaflets hinge on convex pivot guides on the ring. This differs from other mechanical valves that have cavities in the hinge area. The open pivot design feature is intended to decrease blood stasis and thrombus formation near the hinge points. The valve design minimizes overall valve height and generates a larger orifice area. Valve noise is reportedly reduced by this design.S17 The mitral prosthesis is available in sizes 27 to 33 mm.

The *On-X mechanical valve* (Fig. 11-54), approved by the FDA in 2002, is a pure pyrolytic carbon leaflet valve prosthesis with a bileaflet design similar to other bileaflet prosthetic valves. The pure pyrolytic carbon structure is stronger than the silicon-alloyed pyrolytic carbon used in other mechanical prostheses. The On-X valve contains a flared inlet that produces a higher volume of flow with increased washing to minimize flow stagnation. The leaflets open 90 degrees, with "soft landing" leaflets designed to reduce blood element stress. The On-X mitral prosthesis comes in sizes 23 to 33 mm. It is available with an intra- and supraanular sewing ring.

#### *Bioprosthetic Mitral Valve Replacement Devices*

A number of stent-mounted bioprosthetic devices are in clinical use for mitral valve replacement, including those with leaflets made of xenograft aortic valves, bovine or equine pericardium, and allograft aortic valves, fascia lata, and dura mater. Commercially available stented bioprosthetic mitral valves contain either porcine aortic valve leaflets or leaflets constructed from pericardium. These stented valves are designed to mimic flow characteristics of the in situ aortic valve. Pericardial prostheses have been greatly modified since the original Ionescu-Shiley valve, which demonstrated poor durability, manifested frequently by leaflet tearing. Bioprosthetic valves are preserved with glutaraldehyde, which cross-links collagen fibers and reduces normal turnover of extracellular matrix tissues.H15 Glutaraldehyde fixation of porcine valves is achieved at high (60-80 mm Hg), low (<3 mm Hg), or zero pressure conditions. Lower fixation pressures in newer-generation porcine valves may reduce the tendency for calcification.H14 Current pericardial valves include glutaraldehyde fixation at low pressure and mounting of the pericardium completely within the stent, producing less leaflet abrasion and potentially greater durability.

The major advantage of bioprosthetic mitral valves is their resistance to thromboembolism, which is sufficiently

uncommon that long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is not recommended unless other risk factors are present (see "Management of Anticoagulation with Prosthetic Valves" under Special Situations and Controversies). The advantage of not requiring anticoagulation is accompanied by major susceptibility to structural valve deterioration in both pericardial and porcine valves. The end result of valve deterioration is progressive mitral stenosis and/or regurgitation, which may (rarely) occur as early as 4 to 5 years postoperatively. By 10 years, prevalence of primary tissue valve failure is about 30%, and by 15 years, 35% to 65%.J2,M5,N8,P5,P12 The degeneration process is greatly accelerated in younger patients.

The *Medtronic-Hancock glutaraldehyde-preserved porcine xenograft (standard model)*, introduced in 1970, consists of glutaraldehyde-preserved porcine aortic valves mounted on a polypropylene stent with polyester fabric and a molded silicone rubber sewing ring. It is FDA approved and available for use in the mitral position worldwide. The Hancock II porcine bioprosthesis, the current updated version of the Hancock I, was first implanted in 1982. The leaflets are fixed in glutaraldehyde and treated with sodium dodecyl sulphate to retard calcification. Hemodynamic, thromboembolic, thrombotic, and tissue failure characteristics are similar to those of the Carpentier-Edwards prosthesis. Hemodynamic characteristics of the Hancock valve have been summarized by Khuri and colleagues.K13 The reported actuarial freedom from structural valve deterioration in the mitral position was 76% at 15 years for patients age 65 years or older.R18 The valve is available in sizes 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, and 35 mm.

The *Medtronic Mosaic bioprosthetic mitral valve* (Fig. 11-55) is a porcine stented tissue valve that was introduced into the United States in 2000. It incorporates the stent of the Medtronic Hancock II valve, with the addition of α-amino-oleic acid treatment to reduce the potential for calcification.

The *Medtronic Intact glutaraldehyde-preserved porcine xenograft* is a new-generation glutaraldehyde-treated porcine valve in which the fixation pressure is zero; toluidine blue is added in an attempt to inhibit calcium deposition. Although not FDA approved for use in the United States, the Intact valve is provided worldwide in odd-numbered sizes from 25 to 35 mm for the mitral position. Its performance

characteristics have been only partially evaluated,J1,V3 but the information available indicates that its performance is good.J1

The *Carpentier-Edwards mitral porcine bioprosthesis* is composed of porcine (xenograft) aortic valves preserved in buffered glutaraldehyde and mounted on a flexible lightweight frame made of cobalt-chromium-nickel alloy. The glutaraldehyde fixation reduces antigenicity and increases tissue stability.C9,C11 The suturing ring consists of a soft silicone rubber insert covered by porous seamless PTFE. An additional treatment removes phospholipids from the valve tissue. The mitral prosthesis (model 6625) is available in sizes 25 through 35 mm.

The *Carpentier-Edwards Duraflex low-pressure porcine mitral valve prosthesis* (model 6625LP; Fig. 11-56) employs low-pressure fixation techniques designed to preserve the natural flexibility of valve leaflets. It has a reported freedom from structural valve deterioration of 96% at 14 years for patients aged 70 and older.C33 This model is available in sizes 27 to 35 mm. An extended sewing ring for the Duraflex valve is available in the same sizes (model 6625-ESR-LP).

The *St. Jude Medical Biocor stented porcine heterograft* (Fig. 11-57) incorporates three separate porcine leaflets with low-pressure fixation. Actuarial freedom from reoperation due to structural valve degeneration has been reported at 96% at 15 years for patients older than age 60.M33 This prosthesis is characterized by low stent posts in the mitral position. The *St. Jude Epic stented porcine valve* carries the same design as the Biocor valve, with the addition of a proprietary anticalcification treatment designed to increase valve durability. To

date, there are no long-term data available on the effect of this anticalcification treatment on valve durability in humans.

The *Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT mitral pericardial valve* (Fig. 11-58) is a glutaraldehyde-fixed stentmounted valve introduced into clinical use in 1984 and approved by the FDA in 2000. It has a similar profile and configuration to the Carpentier-Edwards aortic pericardial device. Hemodynamic performance is comparable with other mitral bioprostheses. Ten-year freedom from thromboembolism was 93% ± 3.0% in the series reported by Poirer and colleagues.P12 Freedom from structural valve deterioration at 10 years was 81% ± 7.0%, although no failures were noted in patients aged 70 years or older. The newer *Magna mitral valve* adds a nonreversible fixation process to reduce residual glutaraldehyde and phospholipids that contribute to pericardial leaflet calcification. In addition, the Magna Mitral bioprosthesis is designed with an asymmetric sewing cuff to maximize annular conformity.

#### SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

#### Alternative Surgical Approaches to Mitral Valve

#### *Right Thoracotomy*

Right thoracotomy was employed by Lillehei and colleagues in their first open operations for mitral valve disease and continues to be used by some surgeons.L11 With this approach, the incision is through the left atrium just behind the interatrial groove, as in the median sternotomy approach. The chief disadvantages of right thoracotomy are the limited field provided by the anterolateral interspace approach (with the patient positioned obliquely) and relative inaccessibility of the ascending aorta, both for cannulation and infusion of cardioplegic solution. The arterial cannula may have to be positioned in the external iliac (or femoral) artery. A particular advantage of this approach may be in reoperations after median sternotomy when CABG was performed, and when the patent venous or arterial grafts are at risk for injury during resternotomy. It may also be used in cases of previous sternotomy infection.

#### *Left Thoracotomy*

Left thoracotomy has been used in the past, but because venous cannulation is difficult, this approach cannot currently be recommended.

#### *Approach Through Superior Left Atrial Wall*

Occasionally in large patients with small left atria, exposure is not optimal with the approach described earlier under Technique of Operation. The "superior approach" through the most superior aspect of the left atrium, where it appears in the transverse sinus, is an attractive alternativeR17,S3 (Fig. 11-59). The superior vena cava is mobilized and retracted laterally, and the aorta is retracted to the left (after clamping it and injecting cardioplegic solution, because retraction may make the aortic valve regurgitant). A transverse incision is made in the roof of the left atrium as far from the aortic root origin as possible (Fig. 11-59, *C*). The mitral valve is found to be very accessible; often, only stay sutures are required for retraction. Because of this, studying the competence of the valve after commissurotomy or repair is easier. Closure of this incision must be accurate, catching all layers (including the endocardium) with each stitch. Hemostasis should be secure before discontinuing CPB.

The superior approach is also useful when a short, limited upper sternotomy is used.G35 A single-stage venous cannula is inserted through the right atrial appendage, and distal ascending aortic cannulation is used in combination with antegrade cardioplegia. Exposure is adequate.

#### *Approach Across Atrial Septum*

Approach through the right atrium and across the atrial septum can be used but may be unsatisfactory. Exposure is limited, and retraction is impeded by concern about injury to the AV node. Exposure can be improved by extending the incision onto the roof of the right atriumA13 (Fig. 11-59, *B*). A variation of this approach is that of Guiraudon and colleaguesG34 (Fig. 11-60). Incision is begun high on the right atrial free wall and is extended caudally on the interatrial septum. It is completed by extending the septal incision to the superior aspect (roof) of the left atrium. Exposure is excellent, although closure is somewhat tedious. It is useful for patients with deep chests and those with small left atria.

Good results have also been reported with a "minitransseptal" incision in the atrial septum extending from the inferomedial edge of the fossa ovalis up toward the medial base of the superior vena cava without incising the superior surface of the left or right atrium.N10

#### *Limited-Access Mitral Valve Strategies*

Over the last 15 years, a gradually increasing number of cardiac surgical centers have gained experience with limited access approaches to the mitral valve, either with direct vision or video-assisted techniques (most recently with robotic technology). Successful repair of mitral regurgitation resulting from degenerative disease of the posterior leaflet, anterior leaflet, or both has been reported with a variety of these techniques.G4,G5,M26,S13,S37,S39 In experienced centers, mediumterm survival and preservation of valve competence has been equivalent to standard techniques via median sternotomy.G5,S37,S39 A right paramedian incision with division of the third and fourth costal cartilages,C38 a "J" incision beginning at the sternal notch and extending to the fourth intercostals,S38,S40 and a partial right lower sternotomyS39 have all gained popularity, with good reported outcomes.

More recently, numerous reports have recommended a small right anterior thoracotomy, which appears to be currently the most widely applied limited access approach.G4,G5,M26,S13,S37 Although certain details are variable among experienced surgeons, the following principles are generally applicable. The small right thoracotomy is usually performed through a 4- to 6-cm right inframammary incision, and the chest is usually entered through the fourth intercostal space (occasionally the third). Double-lumen endotracheal tube intubation is employed to enhance

![](_page_49_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 11-59** Three incisions for exposing mitral valve. **A,** Classic approach involves retracting lateral right atrial wall. Groove between posterior right atrium *(RA)* and left atrium *(LA)* is developed, and inferior aspect of left atrium is freed from pericardium behind inferior cavoatrial junction. Incision extends cephalad behind superior vena cava *(SVC)* and caudad to the left under the inferior vena cava. **B,** Modification of DuBost transeptal approach. Vertical incision is made in lateral wall of right atrium*.* Interatrial septum is incised through the fossa ovalis, extending laterally to patient's right to meet the right atrial incision and continuing to ventral aspect of right superior pulmonary vein. Atrial septal component must not extend inferiorly or medially, which could put the tricuspid anulus, atrioventricular septum, or bundle of His at risk. **C,** "Superior approach" involves retracting superior vena cava laterally and aorta to the left. Roof of left atrium is opened with incision directed leftward and posteriorly, leaving an adequate rim of atrial tissue anteriorly so as not to infringe on the mitral anulus.

visualization, and use of a TEE probe is routine. Right femoral artery cannulation for CPB is most commonly employed, although direct aortic cannulation can be nearly routinely applied through a third intercostal space approach.G4 A long, vacuum-assisted, femoral vein cannula designed for vacuum-assisted venous return, with or without a second 15F to 17F cannula, is inserted via the right internal jugular vein using the Seldinger technique. In primary cases, aortic occlusion is managed with direct external clamping (often with a flexible clamp) or with endoaortic balloon occlusion (less reliable). Cardioplegia can be administered antegradely directly into the ascending aorta (and the catheter subsequently used for de-airing procedures), or retrogradely via a catheter placed through the right atrium into the coronary sinus under TEE guidance. Alternatively, a coronary sinus catheter for retrograde cardioplegia can be inserted through the internal jugular vein with positioning by TEE, but this requires anesthesiologist expertise and is less reliable for routine use. A left atrial incision in the right interatrial groove anterior to the entrance of the right pulmonary veins provides exposure of the mitral valve. De-airing is facilitated by flooding the surgical field with CO2, placing a urinary catheter or vent across the mitral valve during initial de-airing, and venting the ascending aorta through the antegrade cardioplegia catheter.

Under certain circumstances, mitral valve surgery on the beating heart at near normothermia has been advocated.W8 As long as the necessary precautions for preventing ejection of air into the aorta are understood and followed, this technique can be an important option in the presence of prior CABG, severe LV dysfunction, or extensive arteriosclerotic disease of the ascending aorta.

**Figure 11-60** Biatrial approach of Guiraudon and colleagues, or "transplant" incision. **A-B**, Right atrium is opened transversely near atrioventricular groove. Atrial septum is incised vertically through fossa ovalis, and incision is extended superiorly to meet the right atrial incision. Where these two incisions meet, incision is directed leftward through roof of left atrium toward left atrial appendage. Walls of atrial septum and left atrium are deflected by stay sutures. Mitral valve exposure is excellent. **C**, Atrial septum and roof of left atrium are closed with separate sutures, meeting superiorly. Right atrial portion is then closed. Key: *Ao*, Ascending aorta; *LA*, left atrium; *PT*, pulmonary trunk; *RA*, right atrium.

In the evolution of limited-access approaches to the mitral valve, current surgical philosophies are divided between a greater emphasis on techniques for direct visualization using more standard surgical techniques and instrumentation, G4 and video-assisted endoscopic or robotic approaches. M26,S13,S37 Whether the enhanced visualization using thoracoscopic and robotic techniques provides sufficient benefit to justify the more expensive technology will await further long-term studies.

## Mitral Valve Repair versus Replacement for Degenerative Disease in the Elderly

When successful reconstruction is feasible, repair is advisable for degenerative disease in the elderly to avoid risk of prosthesis-related complications. However, a propensity-matching analysis by Gillinov and colleagues demonstrated

similar survival and freedom from reoperation in elderly patients undergoing mitral replacement or repair. G11 Thus, in patients older than about age 70, mitral valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve is an acceptable alternative to repair when the pathologic anatomy is suboptimal for repair (posterior anular calcification, marked prolapse of both anterior and posterior leaflets, valvar calcification).

#### Mitral Valve Replacement with Allograft

Acar and colleagues revitalized interest in mitral valve replacement with a mitral allograft<sup>A2,S21</sup> using new techniques for fixation of the papillary muscles (side-by-side fine monofilament suture) and employing an anuloplasty ring in all cases<sup>A3,A5</sup> (Fig. 11-61). Use of an allograft in the mitral position has a potential advantage in the setting of endocarditis

![](_page_51_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 11-61** Mitral valve replacement with mitral allograft using papillary muscle fixation and anuloplasty. **A,** Mitral valve is exposed in usual manner, and leaflets are completely resected at their bases. Chordae are excised at their papillary muscle origin. Muscular trabeculations attaching papillary muscles to free wall of left ventricle are divided. **B,** Cryopreserved mitral allograft, thawed and trimmed, is positioned for insertion. Interrupted 5-0 monofilament sutures (10-12) secure donor papillary muscle to recipient papillary muscle in side-by-side fashion.

because of its known resistance to recurrent infection (see Chapter 15). Early enthusiasm for this technique was also, in the past, related to the possibility of better durability in younger patients than bioprosthetic valves.

An 8-year analysis of allograft mitral valve replacement (complete in 65 patients and partial in 39) by Ali, Acar, and colleaguesA14 underscored the important risk of early reoperation for valve dysfunction related to restriction of leaflet movement secondary to deep implantation of papillary muscles or an undersized allograft. Based on recommendations from Acar and colleagues, selection of allograft size was based on matching the height of the anterior leaflet. However,

**C,** Using continuous 4-0 polypropylene suture, donor anulus is sewn to bases of resected recipient leaflets beginning at left fibrous trigone and working clockwise anteriorly to right fibrous trigone, then in a counterclockwise direction posteriorly. A supporting anuloplasty ring is added. **Figure 11-61, cont'd**

**Figure 11-62** Freedom from major cardiac events (cardiac death and reoperation in patients with total allografts was 61% ± 9.0% vs. 85% ± 8.0% at 6 years in patients younger than and older than age 40 years, respectively (*P* < .09). (From Ali and colleagues.A14)

current recommendations include selection of allograft size to match the diameter of the patient's mitral anulus.

Among patients with a complete allograft, freedom from cardiac death or reoperation was 63% at 7 years.A14 The major cause for late reoperation was allograft degeneration, as in aortic allograft and mitral bioprosthetic valves. Freedom from cardiac death or reoperation was considerably worse among patients younger than 40 (Fig. 11-62). Thus, available data fail to show a durability advantage of mitral valve allografts over current commercially available bioprosthetic valves, except potentially (unproven) in the setting of endocarditis.

Mitral valve replacement with a pulmonary autograft has been reported in a small number of patients, with good valve function at a mean follow-up of 6 years.K20

#### Surgical Plication of Giant Left Atrium

Massive enlargement of the left atrium can develop in patients with long-standing severe mitral regurgitation.P4 Surgical reduction has been recommended since the early days of cardiac surgery but has not been generally adopted.J6 Kawazoe and colleagues have used a special plication procedure designed to reduce bronchial compression and improve LV performance; their experience suggests effective results.K8 The procedure is probably indicated only when left atrial enlargement is causing severe compression of the left main bronchus.

#### *Left Ventricular Rupture Complicating Mitral Valve Replacement*

Massive intrapericardial hemorrhage may occur shortly after discontinuing CPB or in the intensive care unit a few hours later. This complication is usually from LV rupture in or near the AV groove posteriorly. Nearly all patients die when the rupture occurs postoperatively, but some may be saved when it occurs while the chest is open.B23 LV rupture with hemorrhage is more likely to occur in women and in patients with small LVs.

There are several causes of LV rupture, but the surgeon must always assume that it is preventable. The most common contributing factors are (1) undue traction on the anulus during excision of the mitral valve or insertion of the prosthesis, (2) tearing of the anulus by sutures already placed when the heart is manually tilted up after the mitral prosthesis is in place, and (3) penetration of stitches into the left AV groove posteriorly.B21 These are particularly dangerous problems because the surgeon is usually unaware of producing them during the operation, which may otherwise have been a technically simple procedure. In the initial report on this problem, Roberts and Morrow indicated that LV rupture can also result from (1) perforation of the LV wall as papillary muscle is excised and (2) perforation of the AV groove as a calcific deposit is being removed.R21

Because of potential LV rupture, the surgeon must be very gentle in all maneuvers during mitral valve replacement. The heart should *not* be tipped up for air evacuation or ligation of the left atrial appendage or for routine inspection of the back of it after the prosthesis has been inserted. Excising only the chordae tendineae rather than the whole papillary muscle, and simply leaving in place deeply embedded calcific deposits in the anulus and placing sutures around them or only on their atrial side, should eliminate these causes of LV rupture. Alternatively, a chordal-sparing mitral valve replacement can be performed.

LV rupture can occur in the midportion of the posterior wall rather than in the region of the AV valve anulus.K5,R10 Whether the mechanism of this type of rupture is different is not certain, but LV trauma can be caused by penetration of a pillar of a stent-mounted valve.

Once massive hemorrhage has occurred, CPB must be reinitiated as quickly as possible while the hemorrhage is controlled digitally to the extent possible. A premature attempt to suture it will surely end in death, and even with proper management, the risk of death is great. After establishing CPB, clamping the aorta, and administering cardioplegic solution, the left atrium is reopened and the valve removed. An appropriately shaped piece of pericardium is fashioned and positioned as an onlay patch on the inside of the heart over the presumed or identified area of rupture, using multiple large, felt-pledgeted sutures. Even though every attempt is made to avoid the proximal circumflex artery, it may be compromised by these sutures, so the area of the circumflex artery must be carefully inspected *before reinserting the valve*. If it is compromised, a saphenous vein bypass graft to a large marginal branch should be placed. The valve is then reinserted and the remainder of the procedure completed as usual. Great care must be taken with myocardial management throughout this procedure.

A small or moderate-sized hematoma is present in the left AV groove in 10% to 30% of all patients immediately after mitral valve replacement. If bleeding is not occurring, the patient's condition remains good, and the hematoma does not increase in size, it should be left untreated and uninspected, with nothing further done. The hematoma rarely results in LV rupture, but false aneurysms occasionally develop in this area.

#### Management of Antibiotic Prophylaxis with Prosthetic Valves

Prophylactic antibiotics against infective endocarditis are required for all patients with prosthetic heart valves. The details for specific situations are discussed in Chapter 15.

#### Management of Anticoagulation with Prosthetic Valves

The risk of thromboembolism is greater for prosthetic valves in the mitral position than in the aortic position (see Chapter 12 for recommendations about anticoagulation with aortic prosthetic valves). Long-term warfarin therapy is required for all patients with mechanical valves. In the mitral position, an INR of 2.5 to 3.5 is recommended.B31 In patients with a mitral bioprosthetic valve, aspirin is recommended at 81 mg daily. Among patients with a bioprosthetic mitral valve and risk factors of atrial fibrillation, prior thromboembolism, LV dysfunction, or hypercoagulable conditions, warfarin (in addition to aspirin) is indicated to keep the INR at 2.0 to 3.0.B31 When warfarin is indicated for mechanical or bioprosthetic valves and the patient cannot take warfarin, aspirin is indicated at a dose of 81 to 325 mg daily.

Among patients who experience a *thromboembolic event* while on recommended antithrombotic therapy*,* a more intensive regimen of warfarin or aspirin is advisable.B31 If the warfarin INR is 2.0 to 3.0, it should be increased to 2.5 to 3.5; if the latter was used, it should be increased to 3.5 to 4.5 unless bleeding issues contraindicate this level of anticoagulation. If aspirin is used in the late regimen, it should be increased from 81 to 325 mg daily, or if the 325 mg daily is maintenance, addition of clopidogrel 75 mg daily should be considered.

When patients experience *excessive anticoagulation* (INR > 5), risk of hemorrhage is greatly increased. In the absence of bleeding, simply withholding warfarin until the INR is again therapeutic is usually sufficient. If more aggressive reversal is desirable, oral vitamin K1 (phytonadione) should be administered with caution because overcorrection may lead to a hypercoagulable state. Low-dose oral (1-2.5 mg) or intravenous (1 mg) vitamin K appears generally safe in this situation.W4,Y3 In emergency situations, administration of fresh frozen plasma is preferable to highdose vitamin K1.

When patients with a mechanical mitral prosthesis require interruption of warfarin therapy for noncardiac surgery, invasive procedures, or dental work, warfarin is discontinued, and either intravenous heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin injections (twice daily) should be administered when the INR falls below 2.0.B31 These agents should be stopped 4 to 6 hours before the procedure, resumed following the procedure when bleeding stability is appropriate, and continued thereafter until the INR with warfarin resumption reaches 2.0. Low-molecular-weight heparin is attractive because it may be administered on an outpatient basis.

#### Treatment of Valve Thrombosis

Thrombosis of a mechanical mitral prosthesis is uncommon but devastating, usually affecting patients who are inadequately anticoagulated. Thrombosis may be subacute or may present as an urgent event characterized by low cardiac output and pulmonary venous hypertension, and occasionally is preceded by thromboembolism. Although auscultation and cardiac fluoroscopy were appropriate elements for diagnosis in the past, echocardiography is by far the most reliable diagnostic study.

Optimal therapy is controversial. In general, surgical therapy is preferred for valve thrombosis, particularly for leftsided prostheses. In some patients, simple thrombectomy is appropriate. In most patients, however, thrombotic material may be adherent and often extends to the relatively inaccessible ventricular aspect of the prosthesis. Occasionally, thrombotic material is indistinguishable from the vegetations of endocarditis. Thus, removal and replacement of the device is preferred. Mortality in these situations is 10% to 20%.M7

Fibrinolytic therapy with urokinase, streptokinase, or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator has been successful, but the important risk of internal bleeding must be weighed against surgical intervention. Fibrinolytic therapy carries a major increased risk of active internal bleeding, recent trauma, history of hemorrhagic stroke, large or mobile thrombi, and recent surgery. In addition, lysis may be incomplete, with the potential for associated systemic embolization. Fibrinolytic therapy is perhaps most effective for valves in the tricuspid position, but is also effective in some cases of acute mitral prosthetic thrombosis. The 2006 ACC/AHA practice guidelinesB31 support consideration of fibrinolytic therapy as first line for patients with thrombosed right-sided prosthetic valves with NYHA class III/IV symptoms, thrombosed leftsided prosthetic valves, NYHA class I/II symptoms and a small clot burden, and thrombosed left-sided prosthetic valves with NYHA class III/IV symptoms if the risk of emergent surgical intervention is considered excessive. In the presence of excessive pannus formation, fibrinolytic therapy is ineffective.

### **Section II Mitral Valve Surgery with Coexisting Tricuspid Valve Disease**

#### MORPHOLOGY

Slightly under half of patients undergoing mitral valve surgery exhibit some evidence of tricuspid regurgitation, which may be *organic* (rheumatic) in origin or, more frequently, *functional*. C27 The importance of distinguishing between functional and organic tricuspid regurgitation in patients with mitral valve disease was illustrated by Duran and colleagues.D28 When they ignored functional tricuspid regurgitation present at mitral valve surgery, tricuspid regurgitation was absent late postoperatively in all eight patients with low pulmonary vascular resistance (Rp) postoperatively, but was present in all nine patients with high Rp late postoperatively (*P* < .0001). Untreated functional tricuspid regurgitation disappeared in eight (47%; CL 32%-62%) of 17 patients undergoing mitral valve surgery. In contrast, ignored organic tricuspid regurgitation disappeared in none (0%; CL 9%-13%) of 14 patients undergoing mitral valve surgery (*P* = .003).

#### CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

Tricuspid regurgitation is apt to coexist when mitral regurgitation is rheumatic in origin and long-standing and when important symptoms have been present for more than about 6 years.C27 In the absence of actual rheumatic involvement of the tricuspid valve, this finding is probably related to low RVEF (<30%), found in many patients with long-standing mitral regurgitation.H17 Clinical features and diagnostic criteria of other forms of tricuspid regurgitation are discussed in Chapter 14*.*

#### NATURAL HISTORY

Patients with functional tricuspid regurgitation secondary to mitral valve disease who do *not* undergo repair of regurgitation at mitral valve surgery have a variable course late postoperatively (see also Chapter 14)*.* B38 Although BraunwaldB38 and others in an earlier era recommended against concomitant mitral valve and tricuspid valve surgery, the appearance of important late tricuspid regurgitation subsequently became apparent.B39,P13,S22 Data from many sources have confirmed the deleterious late effects of failure to address severe tricuspid regurgitation at the time of surgery for the primary mitral valve lesion. Probably depending in part on the surgeon's reason for not repairing the tricuspid valve at the original mitral valve operation, 6% (CL 4%-9%)S24 to 35%S22 (CL 23%- 49%) have moderate or severe regurgitation late postoperatively. In most patients, tricuspid regurgitation is a persistent form of the preoperative condition, but some patients have a newly developed or worsening postoperative form despite surgically improved mitral valve function.

Clinically severe tricuspid regurgitation is present in one quarter to one third of patients undergoing surgery for rheumatic mitral valve disease.I6,P13 The presence and severity of tricuspid regurgitation late after mitral valve surgery is at least in part a function of the morphology (rheumatic vs. functional) of the tricuspid regurgitation and the type and severity of the mitral disease. By echocardiographic studies, evidence of at least moderate tricuspid regurgitation in patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease exceeds 60%.P13 Moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation is reported in more than 70% of patients 3 years after surgical repair of ischemic mitral regurgitation,M9 but prevalence of late severe tricuspid regurgitation of less than 20% is reported following mitral valve repair with an added tricuspid anuloplasty.D12 Late severe tricuspid regurgitation is less common after surgery for degenerative mitral valve disease, with a prevalence of less than 20% by 4 years.A19

Usually, late tricuspid regurgitation is secondary to anular dilatation (see Chapter 14). Although the probability of late progressive worsening of tricuspid regurgitation is unknown, Matsuyama and colleaguesM10 reported that among patients with grade 2 tricuspid regurgitation before mitral valve surgery who did not have tricuspid anuloplasty at time of that surgery, 37% developed late moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.

When pulmonary hypertension secondary to severe mitral stenosis is associated with moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation, the regurgitation usually regresses after mitral valve surgery. Although pulmonary arteriolar medial hypertrophy can cause permanent major pulmonary hypertension, reactive pulmonary vasoconstriction usually regresses and pulmonary artery pressure progressively falls in the weeks or months following successful mitral valve surgery. Perhaps predictably, patients with severe preoperative tricuspid regurgitation associated with marked pulmonary hypertension have less late tricuspid regurgitation after successful mitral valve surgery than patients with severe preoperative tricuspid regurgitation and mild or moderate pulmonary hypertension.K7

Other predictors of improvement in tricuspid regurgitation after mitral valve surgery *without* tricuspid anuloplasty include younger age, functional (as opposed to organic) tricuspid regurgitation, and absence of atrial fibrillation.H4

Incremental risk factors for persisting or worsening tricuspid regurgitation after mitral valve repair or replacement without surgery on the tricuspid valve include:

- Persistent or recurrent mitral disease predisposes the patient to continuing or increasing tricuspid regurgitation. The more severe the unrepaired tricuspid regurgitation, the more likely it is to persist or increase late after mitral valve surgery. Thus, tricuspid regurgitation judged mild at operation rarely persists or progresses after adequate mitral valve surgery, whereas moderate or severe regurgitation may progress.B39
- When there is no remaining left-sided stenosis or regurgitation, progression is most frequently related to persistent pulmonary hypertension or worsening secondary RV dysfunction. Long-standing and perhaps irreversible RV enlargement secondary to mitral or pulmonary vascular disease predisposes the patient to persistent tricuspid regurgitation. Such situations likely interfere with systolic shortening of the tricuspid anulus. Thus, tricuspid regurgitation that does not disappear promptly with intensive decongestive treatment preoperatively and is therefore fixed rather than variable is more likely to persist late postoperatively if not repaired.C9
- Organic (rheumatic) tricuspid regurgitation, usually associated with some stenosis, is more likely to persist than functional regurgitation.

De Bonis and colleaguesD12 identified RV dilatation, preoperative RV dysfunction, higher tricuspid regurgitation grade at discharge, and pulmonary hypertension as strong predictors of late significant tricuspid regurgitation. Presence of atrial fibrillation at the first operation and rheumatic etiology are also risk factors for late tricuspid regurgitation.S27 A dilated tricuspid anulus (≥3.5 cm in adults) is also predictive of important tricuspid regurgitation, irrespective of level of regurgitation at operation.B17 In fact, tricuspid anular dilatation is probably the most important factor in development of late tricuspid regurgitation.S34 Normal dimensions of the tricuspid valve are discussed in Chapters 1 and 14.

Presence of tricuspid regurgitation late after mitral valve surgery is clearly associated with poor long-term survival and reduced functional capacity.S19 Whether the reduced survival is caused by the tricuspid regurgitation itself or the pathogenic factors that produce late regurgitation (see Morphology earlier in this section) is unknown, but it is likely a combination of both. Among patients with moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation late after mitral valve surgery, pulmonary artery systolic pressure greater than 40 mmHg, depressed LV function (EF < 50%), depressed RV function, and RV dilatation are predictive of reduced survival.C17 In the setting of balloon valvuloplasty for rheumatic mitral stenosis, increasing severity of tricuspid regurgitation at time of the procedure is associated with a progressive decrement in midterm survivalS19 (Fig. 11-63).

#### TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

Techniques of concomitant tricuspid valve surgery are discussed in detail under Technique of Operation in Chapter 14.

#### RESULTS

Assessing the results of repair of functional tricuspid regurgitation in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery is difficult because of insufficient information regarding the outcome had the patient's tricuspid regurgitation been left untreated. The effect of tricuspid anuloplasty in preventing late tricuspid regurgitation was examined by Song and colleaguesS26,S27 in a large cohort of patients with mitral stenosis and severe tricuspid regurgitation who underwent either balloon valvotomy or mitral and tricuspid valve surgery. At 7 years, 98% of patients in the surgery group had less than grade 2+ tricuspid regurgitation compared with 46% in the balloon valvotomy group. Furthermore, event-free survival was superior in the surgical group.

It has been reported that tricuspid anuloplasty is performed in 10% to 20% of patients undergoing mitral valve replacement. Less than 1% of these patients undergo subsequent tricuspid valve replacement.B15,F3,G27,M13,S24,T1

Tricuspid anuloplasty is associated with better survival than valve replacement, both in the perioperative period and late.S23 The early benefit likely relates to associated comorbidities or severity of the rheumatic process (making the valve unsuitable for repair), but the late disadvantages of valve replacement are clear (see Chapter 14)*.*

Intermediate-term survival is lower in patients undergoing concomitant mitral valve replacement and tricuspid anuloplasty than in those undergoing isolated mitral valve replacement (see Fig. 11-37). When multivariable analysis accounts for other differences between patients undergoing mitral valve replacement alone and those undergoing concomitant tricuspid valve repair, important tricuspid regurgitation treated by anuloplasty is not a strong risk factor for death early after operation, but it is later after repair (see Table 11-8). These relationships are also reflected in the higher hazard function for death 3 or more months after operation for those undergoing mitral valve replacement plus tricuspid anuloplasty. The inference is that despite tricuspid valve repair, the RV dysfunction usually associated with important preoperative tricuspid regurgitation persists in some patients and is a risk factor for death after mitral valve surgery. Nonetheless, survival is probably better than if the tricuspid regurgitation had been left untreated, although this has not been proven.

The functional result in patients surviving at least intermediate term after mitral valve replacement plus tricuspid valve repair is good. However, the prevalence of return to an excellent clinical status (NYHA functional class I or II) is less than when only mitral valve replacement is deemed necessary. This finding again suggests that in general, patients requiring concomitant tricuspid anuloplasty have a more advanced cardiac condition than those requiring only mitral valve replacement. The tendency for gradual progression of tricuspid regurgitation even after prosthetic ring anuloplasty underscores the importance of other RV factors in determining late tricuspid regurgitation.N5

When patients undergo tricuspid anuloplasty or replacement late after mitral valve surgery, perioperative mortality is high, often exceeding 20%M2 (particularly with rheumatic heart disease), late survival is poor, and functional capacity is frequently unchanged.K14,M2,S5 Poor late outcomes undoubtedly reflect the adverse effect of long-standing poor RV function.

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

When surgery is planned for mitral valve disease, tricuspid repair should be considered if important tricuspid regurgitation is present at the time of the mitral surgery.B31,D21,N5,V1 However, there remains uncertainty in estimating the presence and magnitude of tricuspid regurgitation both preoperatively and intraoperatively. Fournier, Carpentier, and Duran and their colleagues have emphasized that digital estimation at operation, with a finger through the right atrial appendage, is unreliable.C9,D28,F6 In the current era, evaluating tricuspid regurgitation during anesthesia induction as well as before and after CPB is most reliably accomplished with TEE. The value of anuloplasty is less certain in patients whose tricuspid regurgitation is less than severe. Consensus is emerging that patients with tricuspid anular dilatation (≥2 to 5 cm · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> or 3.5 cm in the average adult) should undergo tricuspid anuloplasty whether or not important regurgitation is present.B31,V1 Further details regarding indications for operation and current ACC/AHA guidelines are found under Indications for Operation in Chapter 14.

Tricuspid anuloplasty is generally not indicated when the tricuspid anulus is not dilated and (1) tricuspid regurgitation is variable preoperatively and is absent during periods of good medical control of heart failure, (2) organic tricuspid disease is excluded based on digital or echocardiographic examination of the valve at operation, (3) a good repair or replacement can be done for the mitral disease, and (4) Rp is low. If regurgitation is more severe (moderate or severe by intraoperative TEE) and has been important and constant, anuloplasty is indicated.C9 Because the left-sided disease is usually long-standing and the possibility of irreversible left and right ventricular dysfunction high, a procedure directed at the tricuspid valve may decrease postoperative morbidity and avoid a second operation.

If tricuspid regurgitation has been left unrepaired, if right atrial pressure is the same or higher than left atrial pressure immediately after CPB, and if tricuspid regurgitation is assessed as moderate or severe by TEE (grade 3 or more), tricuspid anuloplasty is indicated provided that temporary acute RV dysfunction (usually from right coronary air embolization) can be excluded. This exclusion can be made by resuming CPB; a vasoconstrictor is then given to ensure normal arterial blood pressure (see Chapter 4), the heart is "unloaded," and CPB is continued for 5 to 10 minutes.

Organic (rheumatic) tricuspid disease virtually always requires intervention, either repair or replacement at the time of mitral valve surgery.

Indications for isolated tricuspid repair late after mitral valve surgery are more problematic (see discussion in Chapter 14).

### **Section III Mitral Valve Surgery with Coexisting Ischemic Heart Disease**

#### MORPHOLOGY

In recent years, about 15% to 20% of patients undergoing mitral valve replacement for nonischemic mitral valve disease have undergone concomitant CABG.

#### NATURAL HISTORY

Reliable assessment of the results of isolated mitral valve surgery (without CABG) in patients with coexisting coronary artery disease is not available. Studies by Czer and Chaffin and their colleagues, however, suggest that survival is less satisfactory in these situations when operation is restricted to the mitral valve.C15,C43

#### TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

Primary considerations in CABG accompanying mitral valve replacement or repair are (1) planning the operation to limit duration of CPB and global myocardial ischemia (aortic clamping) and (2) reducing the need to tilt the heart up *after* the valve is inserted or repaired (see "Left Ventricular Rupture Complicating Mitral Valve Replacement" in Section I). Two methods can be recommended.

In one method, operation is begun by performing the distal anastomoses of vein grafts and in situ internal thoracic artery (see "Internal Thoracic Artery" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 7). After administering an additional dose of cardioplegia, the left atrium is opened from the right side and the mitral valve procedure performed. The left atrium is closed. After aspiration of air from the ascending aorta and with strong suction on the aortic needle vent, the aortic clamp is removed and rewarming begun. Venous and arterial grafts are routed as usual, and the venous grafts are anastomosed to the openings in the exteriorized portion of the aorta. After the side-biting clamp is removed, the usual de-airing procedures are performed (see "De-Airing the Heart" in Section III of Chapter 2). Operation is then completed in the usual manner. To avoid ventricular rupture, unless urgently indicated, the heart should *not* be tipped up for inspection of the posterior anastomoses. Alternatively, the proximal anastomoses are made with the aortic clamp still in place. Operation proceeds as in isolated CABG, using the technique of initially hyperkalemic controlled aortic root reperfusion (see "Cold Cardioplegia, Controlled Aortic Root Reperfusion, and [When Needed] Warm Cardioplegic Induction" in Chapter 3).

In the second method, proximal anastomoses are made directly after initiating CPB. Cardioplegic solution is then administered, and distal anastomoses are performed as usual. Care is taken to ensure that the vein graft coursing to the right of the right atrium is slightly more redundant than usual to avoid damage from retraction during the mitral procedure. Particular care is taken to ensure the anastomoses are hemostatic, again to avoid the potentially dangerous maneuver of tilting up the heart *after* the mitral valve prosthesis is inserted. After infusing another dose of cardioplegic solution, small bulldog clamps are placed very proximally on each vein graft (they must be removed later, a minute or so after release of the aortic clamp) to prevent air that enters the aortic root during mitral replacement from entering the vein graft. Thereafter, the left atrium is opened and mitral valve repair or replacement carried out as usual. After the left atrium is closed, controlled aortic root reperfusion is begun, and the operation proceeds as in an isolated mitral valve procedure.

In both methods, TEE is useful to assess the adequacy of air removal from the cardiac chambers.

#### **RESULTS**

#### Early (Hospital) Death

Hospital mortality of patients undergoing mitral valve replacement and concomitant CABG is higher than that of patients undergoing isolated mitral valve replacement, with or without concomitant tricuspid valve anuloplasty. In an analysis by Gillinov and colleagues at the Cleveland Clinic, factors associated multivariably with greater likelihood of repair included isolated posterior chordal rupture (P < .0001), more recent date of operation (P < .0001), and younger age (P = .0003). Factors associated with a greater likelihood of replacement were bileaflet prolapse (P < .0001), retracted leaflet from abnormal chordal mesh (P = .01), and previous cardiac surgery (P = .008). G16

#### Time-Related Survival

Intermediate-term survival is less satisfactory, and the hazard function for death in the constant phase is greater in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery and concomitant CABG than in those undergoing mitral surgery without concomitant CABG and thus presumably without coexisting ischemic heart disease (see Fig. 11-37). This finding is partly explained by coexistence of two diseases, but also partly by older age at operation of patients with the two existing diseases,<sup>3</sup> and the longer global myocardial ischemic time when the two procedures are performed concomitantly. In the study by Gillinov and colleagues, for the mitral repair group, survival was 79% and 59% at 5 and 10 years, and for the mitral replacement group, it was 70% and 37%, respectively<sup>G16</sup> (Fig. 11-64, A). The unadjusted survival curves diverged at about 4 years because of earlier divergence (<2 years) of the late-rising phase of hazard (Fig. 11-64, B), with patients undergoing

mitral valve replacement having a marked increase in mortality risk compared with those undergoing repair.

#### Incremental Risk Factors for Death

Because patient characteristics differed between those undergoing mitral repair vs. replacement, a propensity score was used by Gillinov and colleagues to adjust the multivariable risk factor analysis for these differences (see "Clinical Studies with Nonrandomly Assigned Treatment" in Section I of Chapter 6). After using the propensity score to adjust for dissimilarities in patient characteristics, replacement was identified as a risk factor for death in the late hazard phase, beginning about 2 years after surgery.

#### **Functional Status**

В

Prevalence of good functional status (NYHA functional class I or II) among patients surviving at least the intermediate term after mitral valve replacement and concomitant CABG is as high as after isolated mitral valve replacement. <sup>K9</sup> This finding is probably related to coexisting coronary artery disease in this group of patients generally being moderate and well treated by CABG.

 $<sup>^3</sup>$ At UAB, age of patients undergoing isolated mitral valve replacement was 52  $\pm$  14 [SD] years vs. 61  $\pm$  8.2 years in those with both diseases, P < .0001.

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION AND SELECTION OF TECHNIQUE

Chapter 10 discusses the special topic of ischemic mitral regurgitation.

Proper surgical procedure for patients with coronary artery disease who require mitral surgery for nonischemic mitral valve disease has been debated in the past. However, ignoring coronary artery disease increases the risk of death.C15 In view of this finding and good results achieved in treating both diseases, important coronary artery disease should be treated surgically at the time of mitral repair or replacement.

#### Selection of Technique

Whether a patient should undergo repair or replacement of the mitral valve depends on the feasibility of repair and possible survival benefit if repair is done. The probability of valve calcification, for example, increases beyond about age 60. As noted previously, important valve calcification strongly favors replacement over repair. Although their analysis includes patients undergoing operation between 1973 and 1999, and therefore likely not directly applicable in the current era, Gillinov and colleagues developed an algorithm to assist in decisions regarding mitral valve repair or replacement for degenerative disease and concomitant CABG.G16
