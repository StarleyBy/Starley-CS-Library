## DEFINITION

Hypoplastic left heart physiology is defined as inability of the left heart to sustain adequate cardiac output following birth because of underdevelopment of one or more left heart structures despite surgical or medical intervention. Box 49-1 emphasizes four important implications of this definition.

We have chosen to use the term *hypoplastic left heart physiology* rather than the more common and entrenched term *hypoplastic left heart syndrome,* because it more accurately describes the entity. In fact, both terms have important limitations when applied in the clinical setting. In practice, the exact point along the aforementioned continuum where an inadequate left heart is encountered cannot be defined with certainty. This limitation is not intrinsic to the definition of hypoplastic left heart physiology itself, but rather is due to two important factors: (1) tests designed to define morphologic and physiologic characteristics are limited in their ability to accurately predict overall left heart function, and (2) new

#### **Box 49-1** Hypoplastic Left Heart Physiology

- **1.** The term *left heart* refers to the morphologic composite or unit that includes left atrium, mitral valve, left ventricle, aortic valve, and aorta. Each of these plays an important role in determining left heart function.
- **2.** Definition of hypoplastic left heart is physiologic, not morphologic, despite morphologic abnormalities being the underlying cause of left heart inadequacy. A morphologic definition of the hypoplastic left heart is not possible because underdevelopment of a variable number of specific left heart structures, either alone or in various combinations, may be responsible for physiologic inadequacy of the left heart. Some morphologic constellations (e.g., aortic and mitral atresia in combination) essentially always result in hypoplastic left heart physiology, whereas others (e.g., aortic or mitral stenosis) may or may not. Nevertheless, typical morphologic abnormalities that result in hypoplastic left heart physiology can be identified. These include a constellation of atresia or marked hypoplasia of the mitral valve, left ventricle, and aortic valve, in association with hypoplasia of the ascending aorta and aortic arch, aortic coarctation, patent ductus arteriosus, and atrial septal defect. It is important, however, to reemphasize that this constellation does not define hypoplastic left heart physiology; hypoplastic left heart physiology can be present without including all morphologic abnormalities mentioned in this typical example.
- **3.** Hypoplastic left heart physiology is present within a relatively narrow band of the broad continuum of hypoplastic lesions of the left heart. This continuum ranges from isolated simple lesions (e.g., discrete coarctation) at one end of the spectrum to complex multilevel lesions (e.g., combination of aortic atresia, mitral atresia, and absent left ventricle) at the other end. The point along this gradually increasing continuum of left heart abnormalities where hypoplastic left heart physiology is encountered is impossible to pinpoint morphologically. Hypoplastic left heart physiology may be the result of a severe abnormality of a single left heart structure (e.g., mitral atresia) or a combination of several milder abnormalities (e.g., mitral stenosis, left ventricular hypoplasia, and aortic stenosis).
- **4.** Inclusion of the phrase *despite surgical or medical intervention* in its definition is critical to the concept of hypoplastic left heart physiology, because abnormalities such as isolated critical aortic stenosis or isolated severe aortic coarctation may meet the criteria of this physiologic definition before but not after intervention to correct the abnormality. As a result, the lesions cited in the previous sentence are not considered examples of hypoplastic left heart physiology. An important implication of the term *hypoplastic left heart physiology* is that the left heart is incapable of sustaining systemic cardiac output, thereby limiting therapeutic options to (1) reconstructions that use a single (right) ventricular pumping chamber (Norwood procedure, superior cavopulmonary connection, Fontan procedure) or (2) heart transplantation.

developments and reconstructive techniques may allow previously unsalvageable left hearts to function adequately.

The concept of borderline hypoplastic left heart physiology is useful in this context because it emphasizes that it is not possible to define a specific point along the morphologic and physiologic continuum where the left heart becomes unquestionably unsalvageable. *Borderline hypoplastic left heart*  *physiology,* therefore, refers to a zone along this continuum in which it is currently not possible to predict with certainty whether the left heart can be salvaged with surgical reconstructive methods. This concept is of practical importance because it helps characterize the clinical dilemma faced by surgeons who must make a dichotomous decision (reconstructive surgery to salvage the left heart vs. the Norwood procedure or transplantation) in the context of a continuum of morphologic and physiologic left heart compromise. At either pole of this continuum, decision making is straightforward. However, within the zone of borderline hypoplastic left heart physiology, the appropriate management decision requires exquisite attention to many subtle details.

The various malformations that result in hypoplastic left heart physiology together represent a special example of *univentricular atrioventricular connection* (see Chapters 41 and 56). Because of the special clinical and surgical importance of this group of malformations, this subject is discussed separately from other forms of univentricular heart.

#### HISTORICAL NOTE

The first description of aortic atresia was apparently by Canton in 1850.C2 Although Abbott had recognized aortic and mitral atresia,A1 Brockman in 1950 emphasized that in about 50% of cases of mitral atresia, there was coexisting aortic atresia and severe underdevelopment of the left side of the heart.B15 In 1952, Lev further emphasized the group of congenital heart malformations associated with underdevelopment of the left-sided cardiac chambers and a small ascending aortic arch, articulating for the first time the concept that multiple left-sided structures tended to occur together.L7 In 1958, Noonan and Nadas brought together the morphologic features of combined aortic and mitral atresia and introduced the phrase "hypoplastic left heart syndrome."N4 In 1976, Roberts and colleagues further organized the knowledge about this subject by emphasizing that in the presence of a large ventricular septal defect (VSD), aortic atresia can coexist with normal development of the left ventricle and mitral valve.R7

The history of attempted reconstructive procedures for hypoplastic left heart physiology dates back to 1970 when Cayler and colleagues described an anastomosis between right pulmonary artery and ascending aorta with placement of bilateral pulmonary artery bands.C4 Other variations in neonatal reconstructive procedures designed to allow survival without the use of prostaglandins to maintain ductal patency were described by Doty and colleagues in 1977, Norwood and colleagues in 1980, Levitsky and colleagues in 1980, Behrendt and colleagues in 1981, and others.B11,D6,D7,H3,L3,L6,M11,N6,Y1

Even though some of these reports noted short-term successes, there is no documentation of long-term survival. In 1983, Norwood and colleagues described for the first time neonatal palliative surgery leading to a subsequent successful Fontan procedure.N8 Following this report and subsequent reports that systematically documented long-term survival of patients with hypoplastic left heart physiology, it has become widely accepted that many of the technical details of the procedure as described by Norwood are critical to achieving long-term survival. These technical details ensure long-term aortic growth potential, minimize pulmonary valve distortion, address distal arch obstruction, preserve pulmonary artery patency, balance pulmonary and systemic blood flows, and ensure adequate atrial-level mixing. Many of the procedures described before implementation of the Norwood procedure failed to address one or more of these issues critical for long-term survival.

Allograft heart transplantation for hypoplastic left heart physiology dates back to 1985, when Bailey performed the first successful cases as primary therapy in neonates.B6 Since then, Bailey and colleagues and a limited number of other groups have considered transplantation as one option for treatment, along with reconstructive surgery.

The hybrid procedure for hypoplastic left heart physiology was first developed in 1993 in response to poor outcomes following the Norwood procedure.G7 The hybrid procedure combines surgical placement of bilateral branch pulmonary artery bands, placement of a stent in the ductus arteriosus, and catheter-based atrial septostomy, avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Initially, it was not widely embraced because of poor interim outcomes; however, more recently it has been used by some programs as an alternative to the Norwood procedure in high-risk patients, and variations of the hybrid procedure have been used as a bridge to transplantation.C7,D4

# MORPHOGENESIS AND MORPHOLOGY

#### Morphogenesis

Currently, it is unclear whether the etiology of hypoplastic left heart physiology is similar in all cases. There are genetic factors involved, although these are multiple, complex, and poorly understood at the present time.G14 Available evidence suggests that a number of primary morphologic etiologies may lead to the end result of hypoplastic left heart physiology. Primary morphologic abnormalities at the aortic valve level, mitral valve level, left ventricular myocardial level, or atrial septal level (intact atrial septum) could all in theory lead ultimately to hypoplasia of the entire left side of the heart as gestation progresses.

Fetal echocardiography has yielded much information regarding progression of hypoplastic left heart physiology. In some cases, critical aortic stenosis with documented forward flow on early fetal echocardiograms progresses to aortic atresia before birth. In such cases, the left ventricle shows evidence of progressive dysfunction and hypoplasia as stenosis proceeds to atresia. Echocardiographic evidence of fetal left ventricular dilated cardiomyopathy progressing to hypoplastic left heart physiology has been reported.D1,J1 Controversy remains as to whether a closed foramen ovale in utero is a cause or a result of hypoplastic left heart physiology.S6

#### Morphology

In hypoplastic left heart physiology, the heart is enlarged to about twice normal weight for age. Its shape is determined by the large right and small left heart chambersV1 (Fig. 49-1, *A*). Beyond this, morphologic details vary widely. Four morphologic subtypes of hypoplastic left heart physiology can be defined based on status of the left heart valves:

- Aortic and mitral atresia
- Aortic atresia with mitral stenosis

- Aortic stenosis with mitral atresia
- Aortic and mitral stenosis

Of these, aortic stenosis with mitral atresia is the least common subtype, representing approximately 5% of cases; aortic and mitral atresia is the most common, representing approximately two thirds of cases. Within these subtypes, the status of the atrial septum, size of the left ventricular cavity and muscle mass, ascending aorta and aortic arch, and ductus arteriosus are also important.

## *Aortic Valve and Ascending Aorta*

In aortic atresia, the aortic valve is totally absent. Diminutive aortic sinuses of Valsalva are frequently present, giving origin to relatively normally positioned right and left coronary arteries that have a normal distribution pattern. The ascending aorta is narrow, sometimes as small as 1.5 mm in diameter. The portion of the aorta between the atretic valve and brachiocephalic artery serves only as a conduit for coronary blood flow (Fig. 49-2).

At and beyond the brachiocephalic artery, the aortic arch gradually widens and is joined beyond the origin of the left subclavian artery by a large patent ductus arteriosus. The ductus carries blood from the right ventricle into the descending aorta and retrograde to the brachiocephalic and coronary arteries. A localized aortic coarctation exists in approximately 80% of cases and is usually juxtaductal in location (see Chapter 48).E1,M10,V5 Prevalence of coarctation is highest in patients with the most severe hypoplasia of the ascending aorta.A2 In some cases, there may be only mild infolding of the aortic media on the wall opposite the ductal insertion site, or there may be no aortic coarctation whatsoever.

When a patent but hypoplastic aortic valve is present, there may be a variable but still reduced amount of forward flow across the aortic valve (see Chapter 47). The ascending aorta and arch tend to be larger than in aortic atresia, with the diameter of the ascending aorta ranging from 2 to 6 mm. Aortic coarctation is common.

#### *Left Ventricle and Mitral Valve*

The left ventricle is severely hypoplastic in 95% of cases of aortic atresia.S5 In this setting, the ventricular septum is intact.D8,E2 The mitral valve is either atretic (about one third of patients) or patent but severely hypoplastic (about two thirds of patients)R7 (see Fig. 49-1, *B* and *C*). When the mitral valve is patent in association with aortic atresia, there may be left ventricular–coronary connections (Fig. 49-3) similar to those present in the right ventricle in cases of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septumB3,O1,S4 (see "Right Ventricle" under Morphology in Chapter 40). It is postulated that these connections serve to decompress the left ventricular chamber. Localized thickening of coronary arteries occurs adjacent to these connections, and there is also a variable degree of endocardial thickening (endocardial fibroelastosis).

Rarely, there is focal calcification and scarring limited to the ventricular subendocardium.O1 The hypoplastic left ventricle shows myocardial fiber disarray qualitatively similar to that present in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (see "Left Ventricle" under Morphology in Section II of Chapter 47), and in the right ventricle in pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septumB17 (see "Right Ventricle" under Morphology in Chapter 40).

**Figure 49-1** Autopsy specimen of aortic atresia and hypoplastic left heart physiology from a 4-day-old neonate. **A,** Globular external shape of heart results from massive right ventricular *(RV)* hypertrophy and enlargement. Pulmonary trunk *(PT)* is large and ascending aorta *(AscAo)* small. Left ventricle *(LV)* is small and displaced posteriorly and does not reach cardiac apex. Arrow points to left anterior descending coronary artery. **B,** Interior of left atrium *(LA)* and partly opened LV. Septum primum (*SP*; fossa ovalis) is thickened and protrudes into right atrium *(RA)*. Mitral valve *(MV)* is hypoplastic and stenotic, and LV wall is grossly thickened. **C,** Interior of fully opened LV. Its cavity is small, and there is marked endocardial fibroelastosis *(EFE)*, which also involves rudimentary papillary muscles *(PM)* of small MV. Key: *LAA,* Left atrial appendage; *PVs,* pulmonary veins.

In approximately 5% of cases of aortic atresia, the left ventricular cavity is near normal size in association with a large VSD. In such cases, there may be mitral valve atresia or a normal mitral valve. In cases of a normal mitral valve, the malformation does not represent hypoplastic left heart physiology, because such patients can undergo two-ventricle repair (see Special Situations and Controversies).

When aortic stenosis rather than atresia is present, the left ventricle tends to be larger than the typically minute, slitlike left ventricle of aortic atresia. Its size may vary widely from extremely hypoplastic with hypertrophic muscle and severe endocardial fibroelastosis to a dilated, thin-walled, poorly functioning chamber. The mitral valve is almost always hypoplastic and may be atretic when severe aortic stenosis is present.

#### *Right Ventricle*

The right ventricle is enlarged, with uniform hypertrophy and a marked increase in cavity size (to approximately three times normal).H2,V1 Both tricuspid and pulmonary valves are larger

than normal, and tricuspid regurgitation of variable degree is common.

# *Pulmonary Arteries*

The pulmonary trunk is large and continues directly into the large patent ductus arteriosus. The right and left branches arise relatively posteriorly and at right angles from the short pulmonary trunk.

#### *Atria and Atrial Septum*

The left atrium is relatively small and thick walled, with its long axis directed transversely toward the right atrium. The atrial septum is also thick, making balloon atrial septostomy generally unsatisfactory.B12,L4 An atrial communication is usually present; in the great majority of cases, this communication is a stretched patent foramen ovale. The septum primum is thickened and stretched so that it herniates into the right atrium and allows left-to-right shunting (see Fig. 49-1, *B*). There may be an aneurysm of the septum primum projecting to the right. The right atrium is larger than normal, with uniform hypertrophy of its walls. When the atrial septum is intact or severely restrictive in association with mitral or aortic atresia or both, there is pulmonary venous hypertension and a variable degree of decompression of pulmonary venous return through connections to the systemic venous system. Pulmonary venous hypertension usually begins in fetal life. This may have important implications for fetal lung development. Dilated pulmonary lymphatic channels form, and these can have an important effect on postnatal lung physiology and surgical outcome.G9,V4

# *Other Associated Cardiac Anomalies*

Associated anomalies are uncommon.F5,M2 Structural abnormalities of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves are rare. Bicuspid pulmonary valve has been described in 4% of specimens; cleft tricuspid valve, tricuspid valve dysplasia, and double orifice tricuspid valve have also been reported.H3 Other unusual cardiac anomalies include intact atrial septum, total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, levoatrial cardinal vein, coronary sinus atresia, atretic pulmonary veins, complete atrioventricular septal defect, transposition of the great arteries, and interrupted aortic arch.B2,J3,M6,S7,S15 Coronary artery abnormalities are rare except in patients with aortic atresia and mitral stenosis, in which they occur in approximately 50% of cases.B3,S4

## *Associated Noncardiac Anomalies*

Other abnormalities unrelated to the cardiovascular system are found frequently with hypoplastic left heart physiology. Chromosomal abnormalities, genetic defects, and major extracardiac structural malformations, including central nervous system abnormalities, occur in 28% to 40% of patients.B13,G10,N2

# CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

Presentation is in the newborn period, with mild cyanosis, respiratory distress, and tachycardia. If supportive measures are not undertaken, there can be rapid deterioration, heart failure, and death due to a combination of pulmonary overcirculation and systemic obstruction from ductal closure. Ductal closure is almost inevitable, but its timing varies from

hours to weeks. This event is followed by rapid circulatory collapse.

On examination, there is a hyperactive right ventricular precordial impulse and a moderate-intensity midsystolic murmur along the left sternal border. The second heart sound is accentuated and single. Heart failure is associated with rales and liver enlargement. In many instances, peripheral pulses and perfusion are poor and blood pressure is low.

The chest radiograph shows moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary plethora secondary to increased pulmonary blood flow. The electrocardiogram demonstrates right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy and usually no left ventricular forces. However, left ventricular voltages can be present but do not necessarily signify an adequate left ventricular cavity.F4

Two-dimensional echocardiography is diagnostic and usually definitive. It demonstrates the large right ventricle, tricuspid valve, and ductus arteriosus and the small or absent left ventricle, aortic and mitral valves, and ascending aortaM9 (Fig. 49-4). Status of the atrial septum is also easily determined. Doppler color flow signals indicate retrograde flow in the aortic arch and ascending aorta in cases of aortic atresia. Antegrade flow in the ascending aorta in the setting of aortic atresia strongly suggests that left ventricle–to–coronary artery fistulae are present, with left ventricular blood flowing retrograde in the coronary arteries and into the ascending aorta. When the aortic valve is not atretic, forward flow from the left ventricle across the aortic valve is normal. The amount of flow varies widely and may reach as far as the aortic arch. If Doppler color flow indicates substantial forward flow to the level of the arch or bidirectional flow in the patent ductus arteriosus, the patient should be considered to have borderline hypoplastic left heart physiology (see Special Situations and Controversies).

Cardiac catheterization is rarely indicated if it is clear by echocardiographic evaluation that the patient has unequivocal hypoplastic left heart physiology. However, in borderline hypoplastic left heart physiology, cardiac catheterization is often indicated to further characterize the physiology, especially mitral valve gradient and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. The physiologic information obtained may help determine whether two-ventricle reconstruction is advisable. Catheterization is also indicated when a severely restrictive or intact atrial septum is present, resulting in pulmonary venous hypertension.

Rather than urgently bringing an hours-old infant to surgery under unstable conditions, the atrial septum can be opened by various interventional techniques (e.g., balloon dilatation, blade septostomy, atrial septal puncture with dilatation).

At this writing, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have a limited role in neonates with hypoplastic left heart physiology. CT angiography, however, may play an important role in follow-up, providing precise anatomic detail of aortic arch and pulmonary artery growth and development (Fig. 49-5). MRI can provide quantitative analysis of neoaortic and tricuspid valve regurgitation, and may be helpful in assessing left ventricular size in neonates with borderline left heart physiology in whom two-ventricle reconstruction is being contemplated.D5

#### NATURAL HISTORY

Various morphologic forms of hypoplastic left heart physiology constitute the fourth most common congenital cardiac defect.F5 About 70% of cases are boys.N9,R7 Severe heart failure usually develops in the first week of life. Many neonates die within 1 to 2 weeks of birth; only 40% survive the neonatal period, and survival beyond 6 weeks of age is uncommonB15,F5,L2,R2 (Fig. 49-6). Hypoplastic left heart physiology accounts for 25% of cardiac deaths during the first week of life and 15% of those in the first month of life.F5,N4

The ductus arteriosus typically begins to close shortly after birth. In some infants, ductal closure leads to restriction of systemic perfusion, metabolic acidosis, and circulatory

A neoaorta (*NA*) is constructed from native pulmonary trunk and connected to descending aorta without obstruction or distortion. Pulmonary circulation is provided through a right ventricular (*RV*)-to–pulmonary trunk small conduit (*S*). There is mild narrowing in distal conduit as it enters pulmonary trunk.

collapse; and death. If the ductus continues to remain patent, a progressive increase in pulmonary circulation and a subsequent decrease in systemic circulation lead to pulmonary edema, coronary hypoperfusion, generalized systemic hypoperfusion, and ultimately death. Rarely, long-term survival will occur if the ductus remains patent and pulmonary

vascular resistance (Rp) fails to fall in the perinatal and neonatal period.

## **TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION**

There are two basic surgical options—reconstruction and cardiac transplantation—for treating hypoplastic left heart physiology. Reconstructive surgery includes the Norwood procedure and its variants, and the hybrid procedure. In a recent survey of practices related to this condition, 86% of 52 institutions recommend as primary treatment the Norwood procedure or one of its variants, and 14% did not make a recommendation, but left the decision solely up to the parents. No institution recommended primary transplantation, the hybrid procedure, or comfort care. W2

# **Reconstructive Surgery**

The overall goal of reconstructive surgery is similar to that for any patient with single-ventricle physiology (see Chapter 41)—that is, establishing in the neonatal period an effective mixed circulation in which pulmonary  $(\dot{Q}p)$  and systemic  $(\dot{Q}s)$  blood flow are well balanced, followed by one or more operations performed later in infancy or early childhood after Rp has dropped to normal postnatal levels. The purpose of subsequent operations performed outside the neonatal period is to move away from the inefficiency of the completely mixed circulatory state. It should be emphasized that all definitive repairs in hypoplastic left heart physiology are palliative.

The exact form of definitive repair may vary from patient to patient based on the individual's physiologic status. Given the inherently limited reserve of the single right ventricle, it is generally agreed that a completely mixed circulatory state, even one that provides ideal balance between  $\dot{Q}p$  and  $\dot{Q}s$ , is not an acceptable definitive state for hypoplastic left heart physiology. Acceptable definitive repairs include the completed Fontan procedure, the Fontan procedure with fenestration, superior cavopulmonary anastomosis, and superior cavopulmonary anastomosis with additional limited systemic to pulmonary blood flow.

Regardless of the definitive repair, principles of initial surgical management are generally agreed upon. Some variation of the Norwood procedure is considered optimal initial therapy. Its purpose is to provide (1) a completely unobstructed systemic arterial pathway from the right ventricle to all organs, (2) a restrictive connection between the systemic and pulmonary circulations such that  $\dot{Q}p$  and  $\dot{Q}s$  are adequately balanced, and (3) unobstructed flow of pulmonary venous return across the atrial septum to the right atrium.

#### Preoperative Management

Perinatal preoperative management is critical to successful outcome. This may include prenatal transport of the mother and fetus to a cardiac center following fetal diagnosis. Circulatory collapse is usually the result of closure of the ductus arteriosus in the setting of undiagnosed hypoplastic left heart physiology. This may occur when the infant is still in hospital following birth, or after discharge home. If prenatal diagnosis is made and mother and fetus are transferred to an appropriate facility where the infant will undergo surgery, circulatory collapse is all but eliminated.

![](_page_7_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 49-7** Survival of neonates with optimal medical treatment. Format of figure is as in Fig. 49-6. Although estimates represent survival before transplantation, similar survival is achieved with optimal medical treatment prior to reconstruction. (Modified from Jacobs and colleagues.<sup>12</sup>)

After diagnosis, the infant is resuscitated, and prostaglandin  $E_1$  (PGE<sub>1</sub>) therapy is initiated. The Depending on details of the physiologic status of the infant and stability of the infant at initial diagnosis, subsequent preoperative management may vary from essentially no further intervention on the one hand, to maximal intervention on the other. The typical patient, however, shows signs of pulmonary overcirculation, and preoperative management is aimed at reversing or at least controlling this to preserve end-organ and myocardial function.

Supportive therapy in the perinatal and neonatal periods can substantially alter natural history. Judicious use of inotropic support, PGE<sub>1</sub> therapy, nutritional supplementation, and ventilation with 17% or 19% oxygen along with supplemental CO<sub>2</sub> administration may delay the typical physiologic decompensation for a number of weeks<sup>12</sup> (Fig. 49-7). When indicated, mechanical ventilation can add an extra measure of support. In many cases, the respiratory depression side effect of PGE<sub>1</sub> therapy may warrant mechanical ventilation.

These maneuvers are aimed at achieving a balance of Qp and Qs and maintaining unobstructed and adequate systemic perfusion. Because flow into the pulmonary circuit is unobstructed, Rp at the microvascular level will determine Qp. Any maneuver that causes dilatation of the pulmonary microvasculature will result in excessive Qp. Specifically, avoiding supplemental inspired oxygen is critical to the overall strategy; 21% oxygen or even lower FiO<sub>2</sub> helps maintain tone in the pulmonary microvasculature. If this maneuver is not adequate, controlled ventilation through an endotracheal tube achieves moderate elevation of PaCO<sub>2</sub>, causing acidosis, which further constricts pulmonary microvasculature. PGE<sub>1</sub> maintains ductal patency, ensuring unobstructed blood flow to the systemic circulation.

Inotropic agents can be used to enhance cardiac output in the setting of moderate pulmonary overcirculation, but this strategy must be undertaken cautiously because these agents also affect systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances and may unpredictably alter Qp/Qs. Epinephrine and high-dose dopamine, which profoundly increase systemic vascular resistance, should be avoided (see Section IV of Chapter 4). Low- to moderate-dose dopamine and dobutamine should

be considered the first-line inotropic agents when supplemental cardiac output is considered necessary.

All these maneuvers are used to create optimal preoperative cardiopulmonary status. Assessing cardiopulmonary status is somewhat indirect. Currently, Qp and Os cannot be easily directly measured in the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU). Indirect measures of adequate systemic output include normal peripheral perfusion, adequate urine output, and absence of metabolic acidosis. Evidence of a reasonable balance of Qp and  $\dot{Q}_{S}$  includes a PaO<sub>2</sub> of about 40 mmHg (Torr) and a systemic diastolic blood pressure greater than 30 mmHg. Even these ideal values do not guarantee that the expected blood flow values in fact do exist. For example, PaO<sub>2</sub> can be influenced by other factors: hemoglobin level, metabolic state, temperature, and presence of sepsis to name a few. Furthermore, the inevitable reduction in Rp that occurs over time commonly thwarts all efforts to maintain systemic output and balanced Qp and Qs. If this occurs, operation should be scheduled immediately.

For the typical neonate diagnosed early after birth and in whom circulatory collapse has not occurred, the ideal time for surgical intervention is about age 2 to 5 days. In this window of time, the infant completes the profound physiologic changes from fetal life to independent life, yet consequences of a continuously increasing Qp have not yet taken their toll. If circulatory collapse does occur and end-organ damage results, a longer time before operation is often necessary to allow end-organ recovery.

Although not always advisable, ideally, normal function of renal, hepatic, neurologic, gastrointestinal, and cardiopulmonary systems should be documented following resuscitation prior to proceeding with operation. It is not uncommon for organ systems to recover fairly rapidly but then plateau short of complete recovery. Further delay of operation at that point is usually detrimental.

Although mild obstruction of flow across the atrial septum is typical at the time of Doppler color flow interrogation during diagnostic echocardiography, severe obstruction at the atrial septum may occur, resulting in a clinical presentation similar to that found with obstructive total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (see Chapter 31), with deep cyanosis, pulmonary edema, and eventual hemodynamic instability. This presentation evolves rapidly immediately after birth and must be addressed within hours. Such patients are best managed with percutaneous interventional techniques to create an adequate atrial septal opening, followed by several days of stabilization before proceeding with operation. Management as described earlier continues during transport to the operating room and during surgery until CPB is instituted. The operation can be performed using continuous CPB by way of antegrade cerebral perfusion or using hypothermic circulatory arrest, according to choice of the operating surgeon. Both techniques are described in text that follows.

Neurologic development following operations for hypoplastic left heart physiology is below normal. Although impaired neurologic development is multifactorial, there is little question that circulatory arrest is contributory. Antegrade cerebral perfusion provides the advantage of continuous blood flow and oxygenation to the brain; however, it is possible that this technique also introduces new risks. It is unlikely that techniques of reconstruction that avoid circulatory arrest will result in dramatic changes in short-term

survival, because factors related to hypothermia, CPB itself, and myocardial ischemia are not avoided. Long-term benefits related to neurologic development may exist but are yet to be proven.

#### *Norwood Procedure Using Continuous Perfusion*

Although several techniques for accomplishing the Norwood procedure using continuous perfusion have been described,A3,T3 the one presented has been used routinely since 1997 by one of the authors (FLH), with some modifications.M4,R5

After median sternotomy, the thymus is subtotally removed and the anterior pericardium opened widely. Aortic arch vessels are dissected well above the brachiocephalic vein. The small aorta is separated from the pulmonary trunk and right pulmonary artery, and the ductus arteriosus, aortic arch, and proximal descending thoracic aorta are dissected.

Marking 7-0 monofilament sutures are placed on adjacent portions of the pulmonary trunk and ascending aorta to indicate the point of eventual pulmonary trunk–to-aorta anastomosis. Positions of these marking sutures are chosen with great care because they will determine the correct orientation of, and incisions in, the aorta and pulmonary trunk necessary to create a functional anastomosis; alignment of this anastomosis is critical for unobstructed coronary blood flow in aortic atresia. The first marking suture is placed in the adventitia of the pulmonary trunk 1 to 2 mm above the sinutubular junction and circumferentially exactly where the small ascending aorta lies against it. The second suture on the aortic adventitia is placed so that its position coincides exactly with the pulmonary trunk suture.

A purse-string suture is placed on the brachiocephalic artery about 5 mm distal to the takeoff of the artery from the arch. It is often necessary to place it above the brachiocephalic vein. Purse-string sutures are placed on the superior and inferior venae cavae. A 5-0 monofilament suture is placed around the pulmonary artery end of the ductus arteriosus.

An 8F (or in patients weighing <3 kg, 6F) arterial cannula is inserted into the brachiocephalic artery, and angled 12F venous cannulae are placed into the venae cavae. Alternatively, a single venous cannula can be used, placed in the right atrial appendage (Fig. 49-8, *A*). Brachiocephalic artery cannulation must be performed accurately; however, experience shows that it can be routinely performed successfully even in patients weighing 3.0 kg or less. Cannulation is best performed by puncturing the artery without using a clamp, and inserting the tip of the cannula to a depth less than the width of the artery, typically 2 to 3 mm.

After venous cannulation and institution of CPB, the ductus arteriosus is immediately ligated (see Fig. 49-8, *A*). Core temperature is reduced to 20°C. During cooling, the pulmonary trunk is transected just above the pulmonary valve in standard fashion (Fig. 49-8, *B*). The distal opening in the pulmonary trunk is then closed directly or patched with an oval piece of pulmonary allograft or other material (see Fig. 49-8, *B*). A clamp is placed across the ascending aorta just proximal to the brachiocephalic artery once the target core temperature has been achieved. Cardioplegia is introduced into the ascending aorta. The ascending aorta is then opened to the level of the transected pulmonary trunk, and the sideto-side anastomosis between proximal pulmonary trunk and ascending aorta is accomplished with interrupted 6-0 or 7-0 monofilament sutures (Fig. 49-8, *C*).

In preparation for arch reconstruction, direct CPB flow is isolated to the brachiocephalic artery only. This is accomplished by clamping the base of the brachiocephalic, left carotid, and left subclavian arteries individually with delicate neurovascular clips, and placing a C-shaped clamp across the descending thoracic aorta approximately 1.5 to 2 cm below the ductal insertion (Fig. 49-8, *D*). Perfusion, now through the distal brachiocephalic artery only, is reduced to 30 to 40 mL · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , allowing normal brain perfusion.

The original clamp placed across the ascending aorta is removed. The ductus is divided distal to the previously placed suture. The previous incision in the ascending aorta is then continued around the arch, then beyond the ductus, approximately 1.5 cm onto the descending aorta. Ductal tissue is trimmed, and allograft patch reconstruction of the aortic arch, ascending aorta, and pulmonary trunk is performed. The caval cannulae are snared. A right atriotomy is made, and the septum primum is completely removed to create a nonrestrictive interatrial communication. The right atriotomy is closed, and the neurovascular clips on the base of the brachiocephalic artery and the C-clamp on the descending aorta are removed. Total body perfusion is reestablished and increased to normal levels; rewarming is begun.

The last step in the operation is creating a source of pulmonary blood flow. At the choice of the operating surgeon, this can be achieved using either a restrictive systemic arterial– to–pulmonary arterial shunt or a restrictive right ventricular– to–pulmonary arterial conduit. If a shunt is chosen, typically a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) interposition graft is sewn into place from the junction of the brachiocephalic and right subclavian arteries to the proximal portion of the right pulmonary artery (Fig. 49-8, *E*). Both anastomoses are performed using end graft–to–side artery connections with running 7-0 monofilament or PTFE suture. Variation in positioning the PTFE shunt must be considered based on individual patient characteristics to achieve an appropriate balance of Qp and Qs .

In patients weighing less than 3 kg and in those demonstrating very low Rp preoperatively, it may be necessary to perform the systemic connection of the shunt anastomosis at a more distal site on the right subclavian artery. In most cases, a 3.5-mm-diameter PTFE tube graft is used for the shunt procedure; rarely is a larger diameter necessary. Often in patients weighing less than 3 kg, and most frequently in patients weighing less than 2.5 kg, a 3.0-mm-diameter graft should be considered, although risk of shunt thrombosis may increase with a small-diameter shunt. If the right ventricular– to–pulmonary arterial conduit is performed, a PTFE graft of appropriate diameter is chosen. Alternatively, a composite graft consisting of a proximally positioned PTFE tube and a distally positioned small (6- to 7-mm diameter) allograft pulmonary or aortic valve can be used (Fig. 49-8, *F* and *G*).R5 Regardless of whether a simple conduit or composite conduit is chosen, the diameter of the PTFE tube determines the resistance to flow into the pulmonary arteries. Typically, a 4-mm-diameter graft is used for patients weighing less than 3 kg, a 5-mm-diameter graft for those between 3 and 4 kg, and a 6-mm-diameter graft for those greater than 4 kg.

An incision is made in the infundibular portion of the right ventricle, just below the pulmonary valve. A 5- to 6-mm-diameter circular full-thickness resection of infundibular muscle is then made. It is extremely important that

Figure 49-8 Norwood procedure using continuous perfusion. **A**, A 6F or 8F arterial cannula is placed directly into base of brachiocephalic artery for systemic perfusion. Venous cannulation is through the venae cavae. Because of small diameter of the brachiocephalic artery, accuracy is required during this cannulation. Specifically, cannula must not be positioned so deep into the lumen that inflow obstruction occurs because tip of cannula is against back wall of artery. Also, cannula cannot be advanced into proximal or distal artery; such a maneuver increases the chance of unbalanced perfusion. Once perfusion is established, ductus arteriosus is doubly ligated and divided. **B**, During core cooling on cardiopulmonary bypass, pulmonary trunk is transected above sinutubular junction. Distal pulmonary trunk is closed primarily with a running monofilament absorbable 7-0 suture. Once target core temperature is reached, aorta is clamped just proximal to brachiocephalic artery, and cardioplegia is introduced into ascending aorta. **C**, Proximal ascending aorta is then incised down to proximal aorta marking suture, and the side-to-side connection between proximal pulmonary trunk and ascending aorta is accomplished with interrupted 7-0 monofilament suture in standard fashion, paying careful attention to previously placed marking sutures on proximal aorta and proximal pulmonary trunk.

the caliber of the resulting hole in the infundibulum is maintained transmurally to prevent premature stenosis at this level postoperatively. Using a running 7-0 monofilament suture, the graft is first sewn end to side to the pulmonary trunk, either to the pulmonary artery directly adjacent to the suture line that previously closed the distal pulmonary trunk, or to the center of the patch that was used to close the distal pulmonary trunk. The graft is then positioned to the left of the reconstructed aorta and tailored in length to reach the infundibulotomy. The proximal end of the graft is carefully beveled to the appropriate angle to ensure a smooth course around the large reconstructed aorta. The anastomosis is performed using a running 6-0 monofilament suture.

Once normothermia is achieved, the patient is separated from CPB and decannulated. Management following separation from CPB is described under "Post–Cardiopulmonary Bypass Management" later in this chapter.

#### Norwood Procedure Using Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest

The heart is exposed by median sternotomy, removal of most of the thymus gland, and opening of the pericardium. If the patient is unstable at this point because of increased  $\dot{Q}p$ , the right pulmonary artery can be exposed immediately and clamped to reduce overall  $\dot{Q}p$  and maintain systemic circulation until CPB is established.

![](_page_10_Picture_2.jpeg)

**D,** Small neurovascular clips are placed individually at the bases of brachiocephalic, left carotid, and left subclavian arteries. Additionally, not shown in figure, a clamp is placed on descending aorta beyond ductus arteriosus. Previously created proximal ascending aortic incision is then extended distally around the arch beyond the ductal insertion site, approximately 10 mm onto descending aorta. Aorta is then reconstructed with an allograft patch, beginning distally at end of aortic incision on descending aorta, with posterior suture line followed by anterior suture line, and completing the reconstruction by suturing proximal end of patch around the cut edge of proximal pulmonary trunk. Once aortic reconstruction is completed, vascular clamps are removed, full body perfusion reestablished, and rewarming commenced. **E,** Completed aortic arch reconstruction. To complete the procedure using a systemic-to-pulmonary shunt, an appropriately sized tube of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is chosen and connected from systemic circulation into pulmonary circulation. Brachiocephalic artery and its branches and right pulmonary artery must be controlled with side-biting vascular clamps. **Figure 49-8, cont'd**

The patient is prepared for CPB by placing a purse-string suture on the pulmonary trunk just distal to the pulmonary valve. A second purse-string suture is placed around the tip of the right atrial appendage. At that point, if the patient is physiologically stable, the pulmonary trunk is separated from the ascending aorta using either scissors or electrocautery. The ductus arteriosus, aortic arch, and arch vessels are then mobilized using scissors or electrocautery all the way to the first set of intercostal vessels on the descending aorta. Temporary snares are placed around all brachiocephalic arteries.

If the patient becomes physiologically unstable, CPB can be initiated at any time and the great vessel dissection performed with its support. CPB is established using an arterial cannula in the pulmonary trunk and a single venous cannula in the right atrial appendage (Fig. 49-9, *A*). At initiation of CPB, the branch pulmonary arteries are temporarily occluded with clamps or snares to eliminate pulmonary blood flow.

After initiating CPB, while the pulmonary trunk and aorta are still distended with blood, 7-0 monofilament sutures are placed on adjacent portions of the pulmonary trunk and ascending aorta to mark the point of eventual pulmonary trunk–to-aorta anastomosis. Positions of these marking sutures are chosen with great care because they will determine

![](_page_11_Picture_2.jpeg)

**F,** Completed aortic arch reconstruction. To complete the procedure using a right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit, an appropriately sized tube of PTFE, or, as shown, composite of PTFE and valved allograft, is used. Prior to placing the conduit, the composite graft is constructed during the initial cooling phase of cardiopulmonary bypass. An aortic or pulmonary allograft valved conduit, either 6- or 7-mm diameter (or a 9- or 10-mm diameter allograft reduced to a bicuspid conduit) is connected end to end to a 3-cm length of PTFE graft. Valved conduit is placed distally within the composite, as shown. A 5- to 6-mm diameter core of infundibular free-wall myocardium is removed from right ventricle just below pulmonary valve. It is critical to remove a uniform full-thickness core of tissue rather than just incise the hypertrophied right ventricle; this prevents stenosis at the inlet to the conduit. Great care should be taken not to injure pulmonary valve or chordae of tricuspid valve (infundibular incision and tissue core removal can, if preferred, be performed before reperfusion of myocardium is initiated; this may provide more controlled conditions). Distal aspect of allograft conduit is connected end to side into transverse pulmonary artery centrally, either near the suture line that closed the distal pulmonary artery stoma created by previous pulmonary trunk transection, or into the patch used to close distal pulmonary artery stoma. This is accomplished with a running suture technique using 7-0 nonabsorbable monofilament suture. Pulmonary arteries are allowed to assume their natural position, and the PTFE proximal portion of the composite is tailored to appropriate length and beveled in preparation for proximal anastomosis of PTFE component to infundibulotomy site. **G,** Proximal anastomosis of conduit to infundibulotomy is performed with a running stitch using 6-0 nonabsorbable monofilament suture. **Figure 49-8, cont'd**

the correct orientation of, and incisions in, the aorta and pulmonary trunk necessary for creating a functional anastomosis; alignment of this anastomosis is critical for unobstructed coronary blood flow in aortic atresia. The first marking suture is placed in the adventitia of the pulmonary trunk 1 to 2 mm above the sinutubular junction and circumferentially exactly where the small ascending aorta lies against it. The second suture on the aortic adventitia is placed so that its position coincides exactly with the pulmonary trunk suture (see Fig. 49-9, *A*).

When the nasopharyngeal or tympanic membrane temperature reaches 16°C to 18°C after cooling with CPB for an appropriate period (see Section IV of Chapter 2), the snares around the brachiocephalic vessels are tightened and circulatory arrest established. Snares around the left and right pulmonary arteries are removed, and cannulae are removed from the pulmonary trunk and right atrial appendage after draining as much blood volume from the patient into the pumpoxygenator as possible.

Management of myocardial protection is variable. Some experienced centers use no specific cardioplegia and rely on profound hypothermia as the only form of myocardial management. Other experienced institutions use cardioplegia, which can be supplied in several ways. Cannulation of the ascending aorta can be achieved with an appropriately small needle and cardioplegia delivered directly into the aortic

![](_page_12_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 49-9** Norwood procedure using hypothermic circulatory arrest. **A,** Arterial cannula is placed into pulmonary trunk through a pursestring suture, and the single venous cannula is placed into right atrial appendage. Dashed line on proximal pulmonary trunk shows intended transection site, and dashed line on ascending aorta and aortic arch shows site and extent of intended aortic incision. Marking sutures are placed on pulmonary trunk and ascending aorta precisely where the two dashed lines in this figure converge. After these two marking sutures are placed, aorta and pulmonary trunk should be allowed to assume their natural positions. Under these conditions, examining the two marking sutures with the vessels in their distended state should reveal that these two sutures are touching each other, without even the slightest amount of circumferential or longitudinal offset. As soon as cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is instituted, left and right pulmonary arteries must be controlled with either snares or small vascular clamps (not shown in this figure). **B,** After target core temperature is reached, circulatory arrest is instituted and myocardial protection addressed; ductus arteriosus is ligated and transected as shown. It is common practice to temporarily occlude brachiocephalic, left carotid, and left subclavian arteries with snares or small vascular clamps before opening the aorta. Either at this point or following arch reconstruction, atrial septum must be resected. A limited right atriotomy is made and the septum primum identified and resected with scissors. Septum primum should be resected completely, but care taken not to overextend the resection into thickened portion of limbus or conduction area. Right atriotomy is then closed with a running monofilament suture. Dashed lines signify point of pulmonary trunk transection and extent of ascending arch and descending aortic incision. Note that the descending aortic incision extends approximately 5 to 10 mm beyond the ductal insertion site. **C,** Pulmonary trunk has been transected. There is often very little distance between top of pulmonary valve commissures and origin of right pulmonary artery. During pulmonary trunk transection, care should be taken not to injure the commissure of the pulmonary valve or extend incision into orifice of right pulmonary artery. Once transection is completed, the stoma in the distal pulmonary trunk is closed transversely as shown with a running 7-0 absorbable monofilament suture. Incision in aorta is also shown. Proximal extent of this incision is terminated precisely at previously placed marking suture. **D,** Before beginning arch augmentation, allograft patch is tailored to the size of the infant. Patch is roughly triangular in shape; base of triangle will ultimately be sutured to circumference of proximal pulmonary trunk, so width of base should roughly equal circumference of pulmonary trunk. Other two free edges of patch will be anastomosed to posterior and anterior free edges of incised aorta. The edge of the patch that will be sutured to posterior aspect of incised aorta should be shorter than edge that will be sutured to anterior free edge of aorta. If this is not the case, or if entire patch is too long, kinking of reconstruction can result. Also, apical half of the triangularly shaped patch should not be too broad. Patch is sewn into place beginning at most distal aspect of aortic incision, well beyond ductal insertion site. A running 7-0 monofilament nonabsorbable suture is used and posterior suture line is developed first, extending roughly to area opposite brachiocephalic artery origin. Following this, anterior suture line is developed in like fashion.

![](_page_13_Figure_2.jpeg)

*Continued* **E,** Distal aspect of patch suture line is completed. Attention is then turned to proximal aspect of aortic incision and to proximal pulmonary trunk. Interrupted 7-0 monofilament nonabsorbable sutures are placed to connect proximal ascending aorta to proximal pulmonary trunk. First suture in this series of five to seven interrupted sutures should be placed precisely at the points of the two previously placed marking sutures. Once this is completed, proximal end of patch is connected to circumference of proximal pulmonary trunk. Prior to final sutures being placed, a probe that can comfortably pass into proximal aorta to the level of coronary arteries is used to confirm patency and appropriate alignment of proximal aorta. **F,** Completed aortic arch reconstruction. To complete procedure using a systemic-to-pulmonary shunt, an appropriately sized tube of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is chosen and connected from systemic circulation into pulmonary circulation. If shunt is placed during circulatory arrest, vascular clamps generally are not necessary. However, if shunt is placed after reestablishing CPB, brachiocephalic artery and its branches and right pulmonary artery must be controlled with side-biting vascular clamps. **Figure 49-9, cont'd**

root. Alternatively, the cardioplegia system can be connected to the arterial cannula in the pulmonary trunk, and cardioplegia delivered into this cannula after circulatory arrest has been established while the brachiocephalic vessel snares and pulmonary artery branch snares are still in place. The only additional maneuver before proceeding with cardioplegia delivery using this method is to clamp the descending aorta distal to the ductal insertion site. The cardioplegic solution is delivered through the arterial cannula into the pulmonary trunk through the ductus and retrograde around the arch to the coronary arteries. All other peripheral runoff through this circuit must be reliably eliminated (see "Methods of Myocardial Management during Cardiac Surgery" in Chapter 3).

After myocardial protection has been addressed and circulatory arrest established, the ductus arteriosus is ligated distal to the origin of the left pulmonary artery. A small atriotomy is made, and through it the entire septum primum is removed to create an unrestrictive intraatrial communication. To avoid conduction problems, care is taken not to extend the resection beyond the septum primum. The atriotomy is closed (Fig. 49-9, *B*).

The pulmonary trunk is divided transversely as proximal as possible without risking damage to the pulmonary valve, leaving the previously placed marking suture proximal to the transection. As the transection is made, particular care is taken to avoid the orifice of the right pulmonary artery. The distal end of the divided pulmonary trunk is then closed with a patch (typically autologous pericardium or pulmonary artery allograft) using continuous 7-0 polypropylene. Alternatively, the distal pulmonary trunk may be closed primarily in transverse fashion (Fig. 49-9, *C*). Direct closure has the advantages of time efficiency and less bulk, and in experienced hands has shown no greater tendency to result in pulmonary trunk stenosis than the patch technique.

The ductus is transected just beyond the previously placed ligature. Redundant ductal tissue is cut away from the distal aorta, leaving a small cuff of ductal tissue at the level of the aortic isthmus. A 5- to 10-mm incision is made from the ductal orifice into the descending aorta to the level of the first set of intercostal vessels (see Fig. 49-9, *C*). A proximal incision is made beginning at the ductal orifice and moving retrograde toward the aortic valve. This incision proceeds along the undersurface of the aortic arch and extends down the hypoplastic ascending aorta to within several millimeters of the atretic or hypoplastic aortic valve, terminating at the same level as the transected pulmonary trunk at the point of the previously placed marking suture (see Fig. 49-9, *C*).

The aorta is then augmented throughout its length from the level of the aortic valve around the arch, to the first set of intercostal vessels, using a patch of pulmonary or aortic allograft tissue (Fig. 49-9, *D*). The patch is tailored to provide adequate but not excessive widening of the aorta. Suturing is begun at the distal end of the incision beyond the isthmus on the upper descending aorta and progresses retrograde until the proximity of the brachiocephalic artery is reached.

**G,** Completed aortic arch reconstruction. To complete procedure using a right ventricular–to–pulmonary artery conduit, an appropriately sized PTFE tube or, as shown, composite of PTFE and valved allograft is used. Before placing conduit, composite graft is constructed during initial cooling phase of CPB. An aortic or pulmonary allograft valved conduit, either 6- or 7-mm diameter (or a 9- or 10-mm-diameter allograft reduced to a bicuspid conduit) is connected end to end to a 3-cm length of PTFE graft. Valved conduit is placed distally within the composite, as shown. Next part of procedure can be performed either under circulatory arrest or after perfusion has been reestablished. A 5- to 6-mm-diameter core of infundibular free-wall myocardium is removed from right ventricle just below pulmonary valve. To prevent stenosis at the inlet to the conduit, it is critical to actually remove a uniform full-thickness core of tissue rather than just incise the hypertrophied right ventricle. Great care should be taken not to injure pulmonary valve or tricuspid valve chordae. Distal aspect of allograft conduit is connected end to side into transverse pulmonary artery centrally, either near suture line that closed the distal pulmonary artery stoma created by previous pulmonary trunk transaction, or into the patch used to close distal pulmonary artery stoma. This is accomplished with a running suture technique using 7-0 nonabsorbable monofilament suture. Pulmonary arteries are allowed to assume their natural position, and PTFE proximal portion of composite is tailored to appropriate length and beveled in preparation for proximal anastomosis of PTFE component to right ventriculotomy site. **H,** Proximal anastomosis of conduit to infundibulotomy is performed with a running stitch using 6-0 nonabsorbable monofilament suture. **Figure 49-9, cont'd**

The posterior suture line is developed first, using a running technique and 6-0 or 7-0 nonabsorbable monofilament suture, followed by the anterior suture line.

At this point, the allograft augmentation of the arch is temporarily set aside, and the proximal end of the divided pulmonary trunk is anastomosed side to side to the incised hypoplastic aorta (Fig. 49-9, *E*). This portion of the anastomosis is typically performed with five to seven interrupted 6-0 or 7-0 monofilament nonabsorbable sutures. The first of these connects the end of the aortic incision to the cut edge of the pulmonary trunk exactly where the previously placed marking suture was positioned. On each side of this interrupted suture, two to three other interrupted sutures are placed, attaching first the posterior and then the anterior edge of the longitudinally incised aorta to the circumference of the proximal pulmonary trunk. Care should be taken with small aortas (<3 mm diameter) not to connect them to too broad a segment of pulmonary trunk circumference, because this can stretch the aortic tissue and flatten and obstruct the orifice leading to the coronaries.

Finally, the allograft patch suture line progresses from the level of the brachiocephalic artery down to the aorticto-pulmonary anastomosis and around the remaining free edge of the proximal pulmonary trunk (Fig. 49-9, *F*). This completes the right ventricular–to–systemic arterial outflow reconstruction.

The last step in the operation is creating a source of pulmonary blood flow. At the choice of the operating surgeon, this can be achieved using either a restrictive systemic arterial– to–pulmonary arterial shunt or a restrictive right ventricle–to– pulmonary arterial conduit. If a shunt is chosen, typically a PTFE interposition graft is sewn into place from the junction of the brachiocephalic and right subclavian arteries on the systemic side to the proximal portion of the right pulmonary artery (see Fig. 49-9, *F*). Both anastomoses are performed using end graft–to–side artery connections with running 7-0 monofilament or PTFE suture. Variation in positioning of the PTFE shunt must be considered, based on individual patient characteristics, to achieve an appropriate balance of Qp and Qs .

In patients weighing less than 3 kg and in those demonstrating very low Rp preoperatively, it may be necessary to perform the systemic pulmonary arterial shunt anastomosis at a more distal site on the right subclavian artery. In most cases, a 3.5-mm-diameter PTFE tube graft is used for the shunt procedure; a larger diameter is rarely necessary. Often in patients weighing less than 3 kg and most frequently in patients weighing less than 2.5 kg, a 3.0-mm-diameter graft should be considered, although risk of shunt thrombosis may increase with a smaller-diameter shunt. If circulatory arrest is prolonged, or by surgeon preference, the shunt may be placed after reestablishing flow on CPB.

If a right ventricular–to–pulmonary arterial conduit is chosen, a PTFE graft of appropriate diameter is selected. Alternatively, a composite graft consisting of a proximally positioned PTFE tube and a distally positioned small (6- to 7-mm diameter) allograft pulmonary or aortic valve can be usedR5 (Fig. 49-9, *G* and *H*). Regardless of whether a simple conduit or composite conduit is chosen, the diameter of the PTFE tube determines the resistance to flow into the pulmonary arteries. Typically, a 4-mm-diameter graft is used for patients weighing less than 3 kg, a 5-mm-diameter graft for those between 3 and 4 kg, and a 6-mm-diameter graft for those greater than 4 kg.

An incision is made in the infundibular portion of the right ventricle, just below the pulmonary valve. A 5- to 6-mm-diameter circular full-thickness resection of infundibular muscle is then made. It is extremely important that the caliber of the resulting hole in the infundibulum is maintained transmurally to prevent premature stenosis at this level postoperatively. Using a running 7-0 monofilament suture, the graft is first sewn end to side to the pulmonary trunk, either to the pulmonary artery directly, adjacent to the suture line that previously closed the distal pulmonary trunk, or to the center of the patch that was used to close the distal pulmonary trunk. The graft is then positioned to the left of the reconstructed aorta and tailored in length to reach the infundibulotomy. The proximal end of the graft is carefully beveled to the appropriate angle to ensure a smooth course around the large reconstructed aorta.

The anastomosis is performed using a running 6-0 monofilament suture. The right atrial and systemic arterial cannulae are reinserted, CPB is reestablished, and rewarming begun. If a systemic-to-pulmonary shunt has been placed, it is occluded with a vascular clamp during the rewarming phase of CPB. When the patient's tympanic membrane or nasopharyngeal temperature reaches 25°C to 30°C, perfusate ionized calcium concentration is measured and calcium chloride added to bring the ionized calcium concentration to a normal level (see Section III of Chapter 2). Separation from CPB is accomplished and decannulation achieved. Details of post-CPB management follow.

#### *Post–Cardiopulmonary Bypass Management*

Whether the operation is performed using continuous perfusion or circulatory arrest, post-CPB management is generally the same. Before the patient is separated from CPB, inotropic support is initiated, and particular attention is given to complete reexpansion of both lungs. Endotracheal suctioning by the anesthesiologist is routine. If a systemic-to-pulmonary shunt was used, after complete rewarming has been achieved, approximately 5 minutes before discontinuing CPB, the clamp on the shunt is removed.

Careful attention is given to the mean arterial pressure on CPB at this point; typically a decrease of 10 to 15 mmHg should be expected, indicating adequate runoff into the pulmonary vascular bed. If this decrease is not observed, the cause must be identified. The systemic-to–pulmonary trunk shunt should be immediately assessed for obstruction due to a technical problem. If a right ventricle–to–pulmonary arterial conduit was used, diastolic blood pressure is not affected.

After rewarming has been completed, CPB is discontinued and the aortic and venous cannulae removed. Postoperative care begins immediately (see Special Features of Postoperative Care later in this chapter). Two separate polyvinyl catheters (or a single double-lumen catheter) are placed directly into the right atrial appendage and brought out through the chest wall to continuously monitor atrial pressure and provide reliable access for delivering blood products and pharmacologic support. Atrial and ventricular temporary epicardial pacing wires are placed. Chest drainage tubes are placed appropriately for neonates undergoing CPB (see "Completing Operation" in Section III of Chapter 2).

It may be beneficial to leave the sternum and soft tissue temporarily unapproximated during the early recovery period. This allows for maximal cardiopulmonary function during the first 24 to 48 hours postoperatively and easy accessibility to the mediastinum if aggressive resuscitative measures are necessary. When this "open chest" option is exercised, the skin is sealed with an oval silicone rubber sheet or some other appropriate material. After the patient's cardiopulmonary status has stabilized (48 to 96 hours postoperatively), the sheet is removed under sterile conditions, and the sternum and soft tissues closed in standard fashion. This can be accomplished routinely and effectively in the ICU without returning the patient to the operating room. At some institutions, the "open sternum" option is standard following first-stage reconstruction for hypoplastic left heart physiology.

#### *Technical Modifications of the Norwood Procedure*

A number of modifications of the standard ascending aorta and arch reconstruction described in the preceding text have been developed. However, the physiologic principles of providing unobstructed ventricular-to–systemic arterial output and appropriately balanced Qp and Qs remain the same. Several groups have introduced techniques of reconstructing the ventricular-to–systemic arterial outflow without use of patch material.B16,F3 Much experience has been obtained, and perioperative outcome and some midterm outcome data are available using these alternative techniques. Theoretical advantages include avoiding foreign patch material and the possibility of a modest reduction in circulatory arrest time. Disadvantages include potential problems with suture line tension, left pulmonary artery and left bronchus compression, and increased resistance to flow to the coronary system.

Currently, there is no clear evidence that these alternative techniques are better or worse than the more standard arch reconstruction technique. Other modifications in the surgical treatment of neonates with hypoplastic left heart physiology have been reported.G6,T4 The right ventricle–to–pulmonary artery conduit, if used, can be placed to the right side of the reconstructed ascending aorta rather than to the left side as described. This is believed by some to have advantages.B9

## *Hybrid Procedure*

Some surgeons prefer the hybrid procedure to the Norwood procedure or one of its variants as a primary procedure in high-risk patients (i.e., those with prematurity, low birth weight, associated genetic or other noncardiac comorbid conditions, extreme shock, or various real or perceived cardiac risk factors, such as severe tricuspid regurgitation, depressed right ventricular function, intact or highly restrictive atrial septum, aortic atresia with mitral stenosis, and very small-diameter ascending aorta). The procedure is ideally performed in a hybrid operating suite, essentially a cardiac catheterization laboratory that also has the dimensions and capability to support major surgery and use of CPB.

Preoperative management is the same as for a patient undergoing a Norwood procedure. The patient is anesthetized, prepped, and draped in the supine position, just as in a formal operating room. CPB support is available. Pulmonary artery branch bands are prepared from segments of PTFE tube grafts. For patients weighing 3 kg or more, 3-mm-diameter grafts are selected. For patients weighing less than 3 kg, 2.5-mm grafts are chosen. The bands are cut to a width of approximately 2 mm.

A median sternotomy incision is made, the pericardium opened, and the branch pulmonary arteries exposed. If the patient is unstable because of pulmonary overcirculation, the right branch pulmonary artery can be temporarily occluded with a delicate neurovascular clip. Care must be taken not to distort the small ascending aorta, particularly if aortic atresia is present. The right and left branch pulmonary arteries are sequentially exposed and banded (Fig. 49-10, *A*). The bands are performed before the ductal stent is placed to prevent migration of the stent during manipulation of the pulmonary artery branches. Position of the bands is confirmed by angiography (Fig. 49-10, *B*). A purse-string suture is placed on the pulmonary trunk immediately proximal to the take-off of the right pulmonary artery, and a 5F or 6F sheath system is inserted through the purse string and advanced over a guidewire through the ductus and into the descending aorta.P3

Accurate delineation of the ductal anatomy by angiography is important before deploying the ductal stent. After determining ductal dimensions with angiography, the stent is inserted and deployed (Fig. 49-10, *C*). Another angiogram is performed to assess stent position. If the stent does not cover the entire length of the ductus, ductal narrowing and systemic outflow obstruction may result. If the stent is too long, it could obstruct the origin of the pulmonary arteries or retrograde flow into the proximal arch and ascending aorta, which could be catastrophic in patients with aortic atresia (Fig. 49-10, *D*).

Once position of the stent is confirmed, PGE1 infusion is discontinued. Based on hemodynamic and echocardiographic data, adequacy of the atrial septal communication is assessed. If deemed restrictive, and depending on the nature of the restriction, a balloon atrial septotomy or deployment of an atrial septal stent is performed. The completed procedure is shown in Fig. 49-10, *E*. Routine echocardiographic assessment is performed on arrival in the ICU and weekly until the patient is discharged. The chest is closed over a single drainage tube. Postoperative care is similar to that after the Norwood procedure.

Alternative techniques have been described for the hybrid procedure. These include a left thoracotomy approach,B14 different methodology and materials for the pulmonary artery bands,B14 and use of long-term PGE1 (avoiding stents) to maintain ductal patency.S1

## *Bidirectional Superior Cavopulmonary Anastomosis (Hemi-Fontan Procedure)*

These procedures are performed as a second stage following the Norwood procedure. Bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis and the hemi-Fontan procedure are described under Technique of Operation in Chapter 41. Because it is generally accepted that there remains substantial risk of mortality in the period between hospital discharge following a successful first-stage reconstruction for hypoplastic left heart physiology and creation of the bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis,L8 the second-stage procedure should be performed relatively soon, typically between age 3 and 6 months. Following creation of the bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis, hemodynamic efficiency is markedly improved and mortality risk substantially reduced.L8 Data suggest that somatic growth does not occur in patients with first-stage palliation after age 4 months.G5

Early construction of the bidirectional superior cavopulmonary shunt has two other advantages:

- 1. It allows use of a relatively small-diameter systemic-topulmonary shunt or right ventricular–to-pulmonary conduit at the time of first-stage reconstruction. This creates an ideal Qp/Q s ratio during the first months following birth and does not require the initial shunt or conduit to have a life expectancy of more than 6 months. As a result, the initial shunt or conduit does not have to be "oversized" in anticipation of the growing infant requiring increased Qp in later infancy. This promotes early hemodynamic stability.
- 2. It reduces duration of inefficient mixed circulation that is present with a shunt or conduit. This allows maximal preservation of right ventricular function by reducing right ventricular volume work, mortality risk, and chance of distortion of the pulmonary arteries caused by tethering from the PTFE graft.

## *Comprehensive Second-Stage Procedure Following Hybrid Procedure*

This is a complex operation requiring CPB, aortic clamping, and (by preference) either antegrade cerebral perfusion or hypothermic circulatory arrest. Exposure is by median

(See text for criteria used to choose correct tube graft diameter). Main figure shows the PTFE band placed on right pulmonary artery. Care must be taken not to place the band too proximal, thereby potentially obstructing the small ascending aorta, and not too distal, thereby potentially distorting upper-lobe branch of right pulmonary artery. Left pulmonary artery band is being positioned, preferably midway between the origin and the lobar arterial branching point. Bands are secured to adventitia of branch pulmonary arteries to avoid migration. **B,** Angiogram confirming positioning of right pulmonary artery band. **C,** Pulmonary artery bands are in place. Purse-string suture of 5-0 polypropylene is placed anteriorly in pulmonary trunk.

A hand injection of contrast using a lateral projection is used to demonstrate ductal anatomy. After determining ductal dimensions, a (premounted) Palmaz Genesis stent (Cordis Co., Miami, Fla.) is advanced through the sheath system into position and expanded with the balloon angioplasty catheter.

Cannulation technique and CPB management are similar to those used for the Norwood procedure described earlier.

Reconstruction involves removing the ductus arteriosus and stent, Norwood neoaorta and arch reconstruction, removing the pulmonary artery bands with possible branch pulmonary artery reconstruction, atrial septectomy or removal of atrial septal stent, and creating a bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis. In essence, it embodies most of

the technical components of the Norwood operation, with the addition of a reoperative setting. Technical details of the procedure are shown in Fig. 49-11.

## *Fontan Operation*

The Fontan operation is described under Technique of Operation in Chapter 41. Once the bidirectional superior cavopulmonary shunt has been constructed, considerations for completing the Fontan procedure, although somewhat complex, remain no different from those for any other single-ventricle anomaly.

## Cardiac Transplantation

Principles of preoperative management are generally similar to those described for reconstructive surgery, but donor hearts are not usually available within the 3- to 5-day period thought to be ideal for performing the Norwood procedure. The waiting period for a donor heart may extend to several weeks or longer. Infants who maintain relatively high Rp can be discharged from the acute care facility, but they must be maintained on a constant infusion of PGE1 by a portable intravenous pumpJ2 (see Fig. 49-7). Infants in whom pulmonary overcirculation with systemic undercirculation develops require constant intensive care with varying degrees of support to maintain cardiopulmonary stability.

General techniques of cardiac transplantation are described under Technique of Operation in Chapter 21. The special methods necessary for patients with forms of hypoplastic left heart physiology have been described as well.B4,B5,B6 Donor hearts are harvested with the ascending, transverse arch, and upper descending thoracic aorta intact.

After recipients are placed on CPB as described for the Norwood procedure, cooling to 16°C to 18°C is begun. The ductus arteriosus is excised from the aorta as in the Norwood procedure. An aortic incision is made into the descending aorta approximately 1 cm beyond the ductal insertion site and retrograde around the aortic arch to the base of the brachiocephalic artery. Native cardiectomy is performed by transecting the ascending aorta proximal to the brachiocephalic artery and the pulmonary trunk near its bifurcation. The atrial-level incisions are performed in standard fashion.

The donor heart is then implanted. The broadly beveled aorta is anastomosed to the recipient aortic arch beginning at a level opposite the origin of the brachiocephalic artery and extending to the proximal descending aorta beyond the ductal insertion. Donor pulmonary trunk is anastomosed to recipient distal pulmonary trunk. Atrial anastomoses are performed in standard fashion. The transplantation procedure is modified appropriately when the patient has already undergone first-stage reconstruction (Norwood procedure).

# SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Care after first-stage reconstruction is particularly complex and important (see "Management of Hypoplastic Left Heart Physiology" in Section I of Chapter 4 and Section IV of Chapter 5). Many of the same physiologic issues present preoperatively remain. Qp/Q s must still be balanced; however, an appropriately sized shunt or conduit makes this more manageable postoperatively. Maintaining adequate systemic cardiac output despite well-balanced systemic and pulmonary blood flow distribution is more of a challenge postoperatively because of depressed cardiac function resulting from operation. Aggressive use of inotropic support is usually more warranted postoperatively than preoperatively.

(From Pizarro and colleagues. P6)

Following transport from the operating room to the cardiac ICU, these infants are managed with aggressive sedation and pharmacologic paralysis for at least 24 hours. Sedation is typically administered using intravenous fentanyl and midazolam, and paralysis is achieved with a continuous infusion of pancuronium. Thus, the infant's metabolic demands are minimized, and complete ventilatory control is possible. Depending on status of  $\dot{Q}p/\dot{Q}s$ —assessed by clinical evaluation and arterial blood gases—rate of ventilation, tidal volume, and FIO<sub>2</sub> can all be manipulated to maximize  $\dot{Q}p/\dot{Q}s$  balance. An appropriate combination of tidal volume and ventilatory

rate is used to achieve optimal PaCO<sub>2</sub>. If assessment of the infant is that  $\dot{Q}p$  is inadequate, either due to a restrictive shunt or conduit or pulmonary hypertension, ventilation is increased to reduce PaCO<sub>2</sub> to approximately 30 to 35 mmHg (Torr). If the assessment is that  $\dot{Q}p$  is excessive, ventilation is adjusted to allow PaCO<sub>2</sub> to increase to approximately 45 to 50 mmHg. If  $\dot{Q}p$  is assessed to be adequate, PaCO<sub>2</sub> is adjusted to 40 mmHg. Similarly, FIO<sub>2</sub> can be adjusted over a range from 17% to 100%, depending on  $\dot{Q}p$  and Rp. Higher levels of FIO<sub>2</sub> are used when  $\dot{Q}p$  is judged to be inadequate, and lower levels if it is judged to be excessive. In a patient whose

Qp is considered adequate, FIO2 is usually reduced to approximately 25% to 30% within several hours after operation.

Some institutions suggest using additional inspired CO2 both to limit excessive Qp and independently improve Qs . This practice is somewhat controversial.

Use of nitric oxide in the setting of reduced Qp should be limited to patients in whom there is clear evidence of an adequately sized shunt or conduit and elevated pulmonary Rp. Use of nitric oxide for a patient with inadequate Qp caused by an excessively restrictive shunt or conduit is ineffective and inappropriate. Such a patient should immediately be returned to the operating room for shunt or conduit revision.

A typical level of inotropic support in the early postoperative period includes moderate dopamine (3 to 10 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , continuous infusion) and milrinone (0.5 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), with or without addition of low-dose epinephrine (0.03 to 0.05 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) (see Section IV of Chapter 5). Substantially larger doses of inotropic drugs are as likely to harm as help. Specifically, for the patient who shows evidence of excessive Qp and reduced systemic perfusion, increasing inotropic support is likely to exacerbate the physiologic imbalance.

Other maneuvers that maximize oxygen delivery to the systemic tissues include optimizing cardiac output by taking advantage of the Frank-Starling curve (see "Cardiovascular Subsystem" in Section I of Chapter 5). Typically, adjusting atrial filling pressures with volume supplementation to achieve pressures between 6 and 12 mmHg addresses this point. Optimizing oxygen-carrying capacity by adjusting the hematocrit to a minimum of 45% is advised. Despite maximizing cardiac output and balancing Qp and Qs , it is not uncommon for patients to show evidence of marginally inadequate systemic perfusion during the first 24 hours after operation.

Metabolic acidosis with base deficits ranging from 0 to −5 are not uncommon and should be treated aggressively with either intermittent bicarbonate or continuous bicarbonate infusion.

Urine output is also commonly reduced during the first 24 hours (<1 mL · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), and periods of anuria may occur. If anuria or oliguria persists beyond the first 6 hours postoperatively, serious consideration should be given to placing a peritoneal dialysis catheter (see "Renal Subsystem" in Section I of Chapter 5).

If the infant is returned to the ICU from the operating room with the sternum left open, it should not be closed until hemodynamic status is stabilized. This typically takes 36 to 48 hours. If instability persists, sternal closure can be delayed for as long as 4 to 5 days. If the infant arrives in the ICU from the operating room with the sternal wound completely closed, consideration should be given to opening it in the ICU if hemodynamics are inadequate during the first 24 hours. Substantial cardiac and pulmonary stability can be achieved with this simple maneuver.

After approximately 36 to 48 hours, or after sternal closure, sedation and paralysis can be gradually removed, allowing the patient to take over respiratory function. The weaning process from the ventilator follows the standard principles that apply to all infants following cardiac surgery (see "Pulmonary Subsystem" in Section I of Chapter 5). Prolonged ventilatory support is not unusual following the Norwood procedure and may extend to 5 to 10 days, even in patients who have no definable cardiovascular or pulmonary problem. Under these circumstances, nutrition becomes critical.

Typically, total parenteral nutrition is begun within 48 hours of operation and may be continued or converted to direct enteral feeding using a nasogastric tube. Enteral feeding should be used as soon as cardiovascular stability has been achieved and return of intestinal function is documented.

Some form of antiplatelet therapy is generally recommended to inhibit thrombosis of the shunt or conduit. A typical regimen is to institute aspirin therapy (1 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · d<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) as soon as perioperative hemorrhage is controlled. Care after the bidirectional superior cavopulmonary shunt and Fontan operation is described under Special Features of Postoperative Care in Chapter 41. Postoperative care following transplantation is similar to that for other cardiac transplant patients (see Features of Postoperative Care in Chapter 21).

# RESULTS

## First-Stage Reconstruction (Norwood Procedure)

# *Early (Hospital) Death*

Early mortality remains variable among institutions.J2 At institutions with a large experience in neonatal cardiac surgery, mortality following first-stage reconstruction steadily improved in the decades between 1985 and 2005, and then subsequently plateaued, with current hospital mortality of approximately 20%.G13,K3,M13,N5,R8,T1 In a report from a single institution with a large experience (Mott Children's Hospital, Ann Arbor, Mich.), hospital mortality after first-stage reconstruction was 58% (CL 51%-65%) between 1986 and 1989, and 15% (CL 11%-20%) between 1990 and 1993, reflecting the trend in improved results experienced at most institutions committed to neonatal cardiac surgery.I1

Other single-institution studies reporting cases from 2002 to 2005 indicated hospital mortality of 6.2% (2/32; CL 2.2%-14%),A4 9.1% (6/66; CL 5.4%-14%),C11 and 11% (10/88; CL 7.8%-16%).R5 The Congenital Heart Surgeons Society (CHSS) report of 622 cases performed between 2001 and 2004 indicated early mortality of 17% (CL 16%- 19%).W1 In contrast, at less experienced institutions, hospital mortality still approached 50%. The University Hospital Consortium reported 53% mortality (118/222) among 40 institutions, each performing an average of 7.2 procedures during the 5-year period of the study; however, all cases were performed before 1995.G16

Survival following first-stage reconstruction performed in multiple institutions between 1994 and 1997 for patients specifically with aortic atresia is shown in Fig. 49-12. J2 Survival was about 10% higher at all intervals at the two institutions with the best outcomes in this multicenter study.

#### *Time-Related Survival*

Overall, 12-month survival after first-stage reconstruction has been approximately 60%, with nearly all deaths occurring before the second-stage procedure (bidirectional superior cavopulmonary shunt). In one large series, survival was 66% at 1 month, 48% at 12 months, and 44% at 18 months, emphasizing ongoing risk of death even after successful firststage reconstruction.M14 In another series, 6 of 41 early survivors (15%) died within 3 to 5 months after operation.K3 In the recently completed 15-center study conducted by the

Pediatric Heart Network, 1-year survival was 74% for patients with a right ventricle–to–pulmonary trunk conduit procedure, and 64% for those with a systemic artery–to–pulmonary artery shunt procedure<sup>05</sup> (Fig. 49-13). Recognition of this pattern of ongoing mortality after hospital discharge has spawned the term *interstage death*. Interstage death of 10%<sup>H4</sup> and 16%<sup>S8</sup> are typical.<sup>G4</sup>

Establishment of home monitoring programs, designed to engage parents and primary cardiologists in recognizing early signs and symptoms of patient destabilization, has substantially decreased mortality between a successful first operation and the anticipated second-stage operation, with some reports showing no interstage deaths. <sup>G4,S11</sup>

## Incremental Risk Factors for Death after Operation

Morphologic factors have been associated with risk of death in some series but not in others. In an early study from 1986 by Norwood's group, atrial septal anatomy, preoperative right ventricular hypertrophy, ascending aorta diameter, and coarctation were not correlated with early survival. H5 Although not supported by the two largest institutional experiences, some institutions suggest that aortic atresia and very small size of the ascending aorta (diameter < 2 mm) may be associated with increased risk for death, both early H7 and late H3 after first-stage reconstruction. Intact or highly restrictive atrial septum has been widely associated with increased risk of both early and interstage death. H3 (99,H4,V4)

The combination of mitral stenosis and aortic atresia has recently been identified as a risk, particularly when left ventricular–to–coronary artery fistulae are presentG8,V3 (Fig. 49-14). In one study, fetal diagnosis has been shown to decrease the risk of death following first-stage reconstruction, suggesting that factors such as prenatal transport and early postnatal stabilization may improve survival.T6 In another, however, prenatal diagnosis was strongly correlated with superior preoperative clinical status but did not influence surgical outcome.S9 Moderate or severe tricuspid valve regurgitation preoperativelyB8,S2 (Fig. 49-15) and depressed right ventricular function preoperativelyM7 have correlated with increased risk of death after first-stage reconstruction.

An initially low arterial pH has not correlated with increased risk of deaths in some studies, whereas in others it has.B7,J3 Small size at operation has been identified as a risk.M7,S2 Associated noncardiac anomalies (e.g., tracheoesophageal fistula, renal dysplasia, biliary atresia, intracranial abnormalities, pulmonary dysplasia) have been shown to increase risk.S13 In one large single-institution study, age older than 7 days at time of first-stage reconstruction was a risk factor for interstage death.H4 In another study, postoperative dysrhythmia and reduced ventricular function were noted to be risks.S8 A less-than-optimal technical operation has also been identified as a risk factor for death.K1

These various studies that identify different risk factors underscore the wide variability among institutions.

# *Hemodynamic and Morphologic Results*

Atrial septectomy performed at first-stage reconstruction usually results in a nonrestrictive opening between the two atria. A gradient in excess of 4 mmHg across the atrial septum develops in about 4% of patients.C6 About 10% of patients have important (grade 3 or 4) tricuspid valve regurgitation late after first-stage reconstruction.C6 In interpreting this, the fact that this physiologic variable is a risk factor for death after first-stage operation must be considered.

Systolic pressure gradients are rarely present between right ventricle and reconstructed ascending aorta, indicating that the native pulmonary valve functions well in the setting of systemic outflow. In approximately 10% to 15% of patients, the distal portion of the aortic arch is narrowed such that a systolic pressure gradient greater than 25 mmHg is present. This gradient typically occurs at the distal limit of the allograft patch. It is most likely due to lack of growth potential at this site resulting from a combination of patch material and circumferential ductal tissue in the native aorta.M1 All patients who have undergone reconstruction for hypoplastic left heart physiology should be evaluated for potential gradients at this site. Aggressive treatment is necessary; often this can be accomplished effectively with percutaneous balloon dilatation.C6

Most patients have a Qp/Q s of 0.8 to 2.0 at the time of cardiac catheterization performed in preparation for the second-stage superior cavopulmonary shunt. Approximately 15% to 20% of patients have elevated Rp greater than 4 Wood units. Pulmonary artery distortion is present in a minority of patients, typically at the central pulmonary trunk site under the aortic arch, or at the shunt or conduit insertion site. Right ventricular end-diastolic pressure is typically somewhat elevated but is greater than 12 mmHg in approximately 10% of patients. A hypoplastic left pulmonary artery has been associated with larger diameter of the reconstructed aorta.D2

#### First-Stage Reconstruction (Hybrid Procedure)

#### *Early (Hospital) Death*

Early mortality has been as low as 2.5% (1/40; CL 0.41%- 8.2%)G1 and as high as 29% (6/21; CL 18%-42%),V2 with other series reporting 5.6% (1/18; CL 0.90%-18%),S1 12% (4/33; CL 6.3%-21%),B14 18% (2/11; CL 6.3%-38%),C1 and 20% (2/10; CL 7.0%-41%).P3

#### *Time-Related Survival*

Time-related survival after the hybrid procedure, which includes interstage survival and survival following comprehensive second-stage surgery, is about 60%. It is influenced by development of obstruction to retrograde flow in the aortic arch caused by the ductal stent in patients with aortic atresia.S14 Fig. 49-16 shows time-related survival following the hybrid procedure. Other reports confirm a relatively high interstage mortality (21%) and comprehensive second-stage mortality (14%).P4

**Figure 49-16** Time-related survival in 66 patients after the hybrid procedure for hypoplastic left heart physiology. Group 1 (16 patients) had a predominant prevalence of aortic atresia and obligatory retrograde flow in the aortic arch and developed stentrelated obstruction to retrograde flow in the aortic arch. Group 2 (50 patients) had a lesser prevalence of aortic atresia and did not develop stent-related aortic obstruction. (From Stoica and colleagues.S14)

# *Incremental Risk Factors for Death after Operation*

Aortic atresia with obligatory retrograde flow in the aortic arch appears to be a risk factor for death after the hybrid procedure (see Fig. 49-16).

## *Hemodynamic and Morphologic Results*

About 50% of patients undergoing the hybrid procedure require an interstage catheter-based intervention or surgical intervention before comprehensive second-stage reconstruction.B10

# Second-Stage Reconstruction (Bidirectional Superior Cavopulmonary Anastomosis)

Outcome following bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis or hemi-Fontan procedure in hypoplastic left heart physiology is similar to that for patients with other forms of univentricular heart. This naturally follows from the fact that all patients with univentricular heart, including those with hypoplastic left heart physiology, are selected for bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis based on similar physiologic criteria.

Because a number of institutions with extensive experience with surgery for hypoplastic left heart physiology have reported outcomes, there are ample data on survival following each stage of operation in these patients. These data are supplemented by the more general discussion of outcome following bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis in all forms of univentricular heart (see Results in Chapter 41).

Although there is probably no difference in survival between hypoplastic left heart physiology patients and other univentricular heart patients *following* bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis, it is not clear whether hypoplastic left heart physiology patients are as likely as other univentricular heart patients to meet the physiologic criteria necessary to undergo bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis. Based on a number of factors, including marginal hemodynamics after first-stage reconstruction and ongoing mortality, it is likely that a smaller percentage of these patients will eventually undergo bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis.

# *Early (Hospital) Death*

Based on results from several institutions with a large experience managing hypoplastic left heart physiology, early mortality following bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis currently is about 5%J2,N5 (Fig. 49-17).

## *Time-Related Survival*

Because of the marked improvement in physiologic status following bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis, mortality following the perioperative period and before the Fontan procedure is generally extremely lowJ2 (see Fig. 49-17).

# Third-Stage Reconstruction (Fontan Operation)

In theory, there should be no difference in outcome following the Fontan operation for patients with hypoplastic left heart physiology than for patients having other forms of univentricular heart. The logic behind this statement is the same as that given in the previous discussion of outcome following bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis. This has been confirmed by at least one large singleinstitution study.G2 The outcomes discussed here for the Fontan operation in patients with hypoplastic heart physiology should be supplemented by the general discussion of outcomes following the Fontan procedure for all forms of univentricular heart (see Results in Chapter 41).

#### *Early (Hospital) Death*

In the early era, mortality after the Fontan operation for hypoplastic left heart physiology was high—8 patients in 50 (16%; CL 11%-23%) reported by Chang and colleagues from Norwood's group.C6 More recent estimates of hospital mortality in larger patient cohorts from several institutions is about 5%J2,N5 (see Fig. 49-17).

#### *Time-Related Survival*

In the earlier experience of Farrell and colleagues, there was clear evidence of important ongoing mortality following a successful Fontan procedure, with survival of 52% at 4 years.F1 These patients underwent the Fontan operation in an era before the three-stage protocol (see Chapter 41) was clearly established.

More recent data in the era of the three-stage protocol suggest improved midterm survival for hypoplastic left heart physiologyJ2 (see Fig. 49-17). Secure long-term estimates of survival following the Fontan operation for hypoplastic left heart physiology in the era of the three-stage protocol are still lacking. Reasons for improvement in both early and timerelated survival following the Fontan procedure are multifactorial and apply not only to hypoplastic left heart physiology but also to all forms of univentricular heart. For a more in-depth discussion of the factors related to Fontan outcome, see Chapter 41. There remain legitimate concerns that the basic morphology of a systemic right ventricle and tricuspid valve will place these patients at increased long-term risk relative to some other morphologic subtypes of single-ventricle physiology.

## *Incremental Risk Factors for Death*

Incremental risk factors for death following the Fontan operation are similar in all forms of univentricular heart (see Chapter 41).

#### Other Commonly Performed Operations

The two most commonly performed additional procedures performed in patients undergoing the standard three-stage protocol are repair of recurrent arch obstruction and tricuspid valve repair for regurgitation. These can be performed either at the time of the second- or third-stage procedure, or separately.

Recurrent arch obstruction can be effectively addressed in most cases with catheter-based balloon dilatation. Typically, recurrent arch obstruction is noted in infancy, and commonly in the first 6 months after the initial Norwood procedure.C8,S10,T5 It occurs in about 20% of survivors.C8,T5 Overall risk is low, and gradient relief is excellent. Two single-institution studies revealed no mortality related to the procedure, and gradient relief in all patients, which persisted at midterm follow-up.C8,T5 One multicenter analysis showed initial success of 89%, with three deaths occurring within 48 hours of the dilatation in patients with poor ventricular function, and freedom from repeat arch intervention of 74% at 18 months.

Tricuspid valve repair can be accomplished with low mortality and midterm (mean 26 months) success (defined as less than moderate residual regurgitation) of 63%.O3 Patients with poor right ventricular function after valve repair, even if the repair was initially successful, tended to do poorly, with progressive deterioration of the valve over time. Patients with an unsuccessful initial valve repair but preserved ventricular function often benefited from a second valve repair.

#### Cardiac Transplantation

Experience with cardiac transplantation in neonates with hypoplastic left heart physiology is small relative to the experience with reconstructive surgery and is limited to a few institutions. General information on the results of cardiac transplantation (see Results in Chapter 21) is applicable to this subpopulation. The early concept that neonates receiving cardiac transplants were "privileged hosts" does not appear to have held up. Rejection frequency and severity in neonates appears to be similar to that in the broader cardiac transplantation experience.B16

In the Loma Linda experience, 84 neonates have received cardiac transplants, with 13% (CL 7%-23%) early (30-day) mortality and 5-year survival of 82% (CL 71%-88%).C9 Including patients who died while awaiting transplant, 5-year survival was 61% (CL 52%-70%).C9

A recent multicenter study shows similar midterm survival in institutions accomplished with these proceduresJ2 (Fig. 49-18). Early in the experience, suppressive immunotherapy included cyclosporine and azathioprine without use of long-term steroid therapy. Steroids and antithymus globulin were used only for early rejection episodes. Currently, suppressive immunotherapy varies somewhat among institutions; however, in general, long-term therapy varies little relative to that given other cardiac transplant recipients (see Chapter 21).

![](_page_25_Figure_2.jpeg)

Figure 49-18 Non–risk-adjusted survival of patients with hypoplastic left heart physiology entered into treatment protocols at four experienced institutions, two that followed a staged reconstructive (Norwood procedure) protocol, and two that followed a transplantation protocol. The 70% confidence intervals diverge at a point approximately 1 week after entry and continue to overlap thereafter. The lines, bars, and numbers have representation similar to Fig. 49-6. (From Jacobs and colleagues.<sup>12</sup>)

High early survival has been the rule following neonatal cardiac transplantation for patients with hypoplastic left heart physiology, based on individual reports of several experienced institutions. B1,B5,S12 Intermediate-term results have been acceptable and comparable with intermediate-term results for cardiac transplantation in general. On the other hand, surgical mortality (excluding preoperative death) for transplantation was 42% (17/40; CL 34%-52%) among a consortium of institutions infrequently performing this procedure. G16

In contrast, the more recent report from the Pediatric Heart Transplant Study Group reports 5-year survival (also excluding preoperative death) of 72%, with most of the deaths occurring in the first 3 months after operation. When preoperative death is included, survival at 5 years falls to 54%. An important factor that is difficult to quantify is the death rate of neonates born with hypoplastic left heart physiology while awaiting an appropriate donor organ.

Because of limitations of donor heart availability, the typical neonate must wait several weeks to months before receiving a heart. The intrinsic instability of hypoplastic left heart physiology in its natural state can result in mortality during this time. Attempts have been made to quantify recipient mortality while awaiting a donor organ, but reliable information is scarce. In a multicenter study from 1998, 36 of 49 patients (73%) entered into a transplant protocol received a donor heart; the estimate of time-related interim mortality while awaiting transplant is shown in Fig. 49-7. A more recent multicenter study from the Pediatric Heart Transplant Study group analyzed 262 patients; 25% of listed patients died while awaiting transplantation (Fig. 49-19). The mean waiting period for those receiving an organ was 1.3 months.

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Hypoplastic left heart physiology is a fatal condition; death usually occurs within 1 month of birth and certainly within 1 year (see Fig. 49-7). Surgical intervention is therefore

![](_page_25_Figure_9.jpeg)

**Figure 49-19** Competing outcomes of 262 patients with hypoplastic left heart physiology listed for heart transplantation from 1993 to 1998. Key: *PHTS*, Pediatric Heart Transplant Study Group. (From Chrisant and colleagues.<sup>C10</sup>)

advisable unless economic conditions or lack of institutional capability deny this possibility, or the patient's legal guardians choose to withhold surgical therapy. Curiously, this latter practice remains relatively widespread, even though current treatment outcomes for hypoplastic left heart physiology are now comparable with outcomes for other cardiac defects for which the option to withhold support is not offered by managing physicians and other healthcare providers.

If intervention is to be accomplished, management should begin as soon as possible, preferably with *prenatal* arrangements for delivery at an institution capable of perinatal resuscitation and subsequent surgical management. Treatment begins at birth or as soon as diagnosis has been made, and consists initially of intensive preoperative therapy. Neonates with hypoplastic left heart physiology usually can be resuscitated and maintained in stable condition with such intervention, and the surgical procedure can be performed as an elective procedure, ideally between 2 and 5 days of life.

Whether staged reconstruction or cardiac transplantation is the treatment of choice remains controversial. Although reconstructive surgery remains the predominant method of managing patients with hypoplastic left heart physiology, there currently are no clear data to recommend reconstruction or transplantation as the procedure of choice. Equivalent outcomes, as judged by early and midterm survival, can be achieved with either treatment.<sup>12</sup>

#### SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

#### Aortic Atresia with Large Ventricular Septal Defect

Although this lesion includes aortic atresia, it is not representative of hypoplastic left heart physiology. A two-ventricle repair is recommended because such patients commonly have a normal mitral valve and left ventricle. One approach is to perform a typical first-stage reconstruction in the neonatal period, followed by a definitive repair in which the left ventricle is baffled to the pulmonary trunk using a Rastelli-type repair of the period, (see "Rastelli Operation" under Intraventricular Repair in Chapter 52). In this repair, left ventricular outflow is baffled to the pulmonary trunk by an intracardiac patch, a

right ventricular to distal pulmonary artery conduit is placed, and takedown of the previously placed systemic–pulmonary trunk shunt is performed.

Alternatively, a one-stage complete repair in the neonate can be accomplished. Anecdotal reports of success with this procedure were reported in the 1980s and 1990s.A5,F2 In this procedure, the pulmonary trunk and hypoplastic aorta are reconstructed in typical fashion for first-stage reconstruction for hypoplastic left heart physiology. After completing the extracardiac portion of the procedure, the left ventricle is baffled to the pulmonary trunk with a Rastelli-type intracardiac patch. The operation is completed by placing a valved conduit from right ventricle to distal pulmonary arteries. More recently, single-institution series, reporting experience ranging from 11 to 21 cases, indicate that the operation can be performed with very low early and midterm mortality.G15,M12,N1,O4

# Borderline Hypoplastic Left Heart Physiology

Because of the continuum of morphologic and physiologic compromise among patients with left heart anomalies, clinical decision making can be extremely difficult. Individual patients are positioned along this continuum, yet the surgeon is forced to make a dichotomous management decision. Whether to proceed with a two-ventricle repair or disregard the left-sided structures and perform a single-ventricle repair can be a difficult decision. Although a number of studies have addressed this issue, attempting to quantify the various physiologic and morphologic components of the left heart, the decision remains subjective.K2,L5,L9,R6

Pulmonary autograft aortic valve replacement (Ross procedure) in infants and neonates in recent years introduces another factor into this decision-making process (see "Autograft Pulmonary Valve" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 12, and "Repair of Tunnel Stenosis by Aortoventriculoplasty [Konno Operation]" and "Modified Konno Operation" in Section II of Chapter 47). Ability to perform the Ross procedure along with Konno enlargement of the left ventricular outflow tract, in combination with arch reconstruction and resection of left ventricular endocardial fibroelastosis, provides the opportunity to create two-ventricle repairs in patients considered to be poor candidates using older criteria.R3,R4

Using aggressive left heart reconstructive techniques, it is possible to physiologically normalize the entire left ventricular outflow tract and improve left ventricular cavity size and diastolic function by resecting the constricting endocardial fibroelastosis. In a small experience of one of the authors (FLH) with such borderline hypoplastic left heart patients, it has been found that the true limiting factor for successful two-ventricle repair is size and function of the mitral valve. Except for the mitral valve, it appears that all morphologic components of the left heart can be adequately addressed surgically using these techniques. Although long-term success has been achieved in a small number of patients, it remains controversial regarding when these aggressive techniques should be applied rather than opting for the single-ventricle approach.

Fetal balloon valvuloplasty provides an additional therapeutic option for patients with a borderline left heart. The sole purpose of the procedure is to convert patients to biventricular physiology who otherwise are destined for single-ventricle physiology. This procedure was first performed in 1989, but only 12 cases were performed between 1989 and 1997. Recently, McElhinney and colleagues reported their experience in 47 cases.M5 After a learning curve, they currently quote 75% technical success and 10% fetal demise. Thirty percent of those undergoing a technically successful fetal procedure ultimately achieved a two-ventricle circulation. In all of these, additional postnatal, surgical, or interventional procedures were necessary. This experience convincingly demonstrates that fetal balloon valvuloplasty can be technically performed with reasonable safety in the majority of selected patients. However, it is not clear that the procedure plays a causal role in converting patients from a univentricular to a biventricular circulation. The physiologic and morphologic selection criteria for entry into the fetal treatment program were not dissimilar to those of the patients treated by one of the authors, cited earlier, who achieved biventricular repair after a postnatal Ross Konno, arch repair, and endocardial fibroelastosis resection—without fetal intervention.

# Use or Avoidance of Circulatory Arrest

When performing the Norwood procedure, the decision to use either hypothermic circulatory arrest or continuous perfusion, most commonly in the form of antegrade cerebral perfusion, is made based on surgeon preference. Surgeon preference is most heavily influenced by personal experience and expert opinion, and less so by objective data.O2 Hypothermic circulatory arrest techniques have been available for more than 40 years and continue to evolve. Antegrade cerebral perfusion techniques have been available for a little over a decade and are rapidly evolving as well.

Techniques are also now available for reliably performing complex neonatal cardiac surgery, including the Norwood procedure and its variants, without using total body circulatory arrest.H1,M4,M8,N3,O6 Only limited evidence unequivocally demonstrates that avoiding circulatory arrest is beneficial, but a number of compelling arguments can be made supporting the position that continuous circulation, especially to the brain, should be maintained.

Although numerous maneuvers have been used to minimize unwanted sequelae of controlled cerebral ischemia that attends circulatory arrest, both clinical and animal studies indicate that profound metabolic changes take place within minutes of cessation of blood flow, regardless of temperature of the brain tissue (see Section I of Chapter 2 for details and references). Based on these studies, it is difficult to pinpoint with confidence the threshold for a safe period of circulatory arrest, although several clinical studies have attempted to define that point. The safe period concept is only valid as a tool to be applied prospectively in clinical decision making for individual patients if one assumes that all patients are equally susceptible to cerebral ischemia. There is increasing evidence that this is not the case; it is becoming recognized that genetic polymorphism can influence vulnerability of the brain to ischemic insult from individual to individual.G3

Based on data showing that metabolic derangements begin immediately with circulatory arrest, and on carefully conducted animal and clinical studies demonstrating that neurologic sequelae correlate with increasing length of circulatory arrest (see "Safe Duration of Circulatory Arrest" in Section I of Chapter 2), it can be argued that clinical studies failing to show sequelae following circulatory arrest are simply using end-point criteria that are insensitive to subtle cognitive injury that may occur with shorter arrest periods or are underpowered to demonstrate a difference. The strongest justification for using circulatory arrest has been that instrumentation, cannulae, and techniques are not available to allow repair of complex aortic arch problems in neonates using continuous perfusion. This justification, however, no longer exists. H1,M4,M8,N3,O6 Although it is clear that continuous perfusion can eliminate the metabolic derangements that occur with cessation of cerebral blood flow, potential complications relating to techniques required to maintain ongoing perfusion can also occur, and these must be defined and studied.

Safeguards that are necessary to avoid perfusion-related complications, however, should be no different from those of standard CPB. There are limited data directly comparing continuous perfusion and hypothermic circulatory arrest in patients undergoing the Norwood procedure and its variants. There is a single randomized prospective study comparing it with antegrade cerebral perfusion. G11 That study did not examine early mortality or morbidity, but focused on neurodevelopmental outcome at midterm follow-up in a single institution; no difference in outcome between the two techniques was demonstrated. This conclusion is of limited value, however, because the methodology used for the antegrade cerebral perfusion group involved periods of hypothermic circulatory arrest, multiple cannulation maneuvers, and baseline perfusion rates (20 mL · kg<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>) that many would consider in the low flow range. The critique of this manuscript, which accompanies the publication, emphasizes these limitations and further points out that the compelling theoretical advantages of continuous perfusion must be supplemented by both developing a rigorous physiologic understanding of techniques such as antegrade cerebral perfusion, and standardizing operative techniques that minimize morbidity. The current state-of-the-art of antegrade cerebral perfusion lacks these important components. N3,S3 Several single-institution studies have established that the Norwood procedure can be performed using continuous perfusion, with early morbidity and mortality comparable with outcomes achieved using hypothermic circulatory arrest.  $^{\mathrm{M4,M8,N3,06}}$ Some studies indicate an early survival advantage using antegrade cerebral perfusion.<sup>H1</sup>

## Comparison of Right Ventricle–to–Pulmonary Trunk Conduit and Systemic-to–Pulmonary Artery Shunt as Source of Pulmonary Blood Flow in First-Stage Reconstruction

For decades, a systemic–pulmonary arterial shunt has been the mainstay for providing regulated  $\dot{Q}p$  to the lungs in first-stage reconstruction. The most commonly used procedure for accomplishing this is the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt using a PTFE graft. Its potential disadvantages include excessive volume load, acute thrombosis, and low diastolic blood pressure leading to coronary insufficiency. Although Norwood originally experimented with right ventricle–to–pulmonary artery conduits as the source of pulmonary blood flow in first-stage reconstruction,  $^{\rm N7}$  this was quickly abandoned.

Over the past decade, the concept of the right ventricle-to-pulmonary trunk conduit as the source of pulmonary blood flow has been reexamined. These techniques use

either a valved or nonvalved conduit between right ventricle and central distal pulmonary trunk. They have several potential advantages, the most important of which is lack of diastolic runoff from the systemic circulation. This provides importantly elevated diastolic blood pressure in the aorta and coronary arteries compared with the systemic-pulmonary shunt, with the potential advantage of promoting more stable cardiac performance by reducing myocardial oxygen supply/ demand mismatch that undoubtedly occurs in the standard Norwood operation, in which the single right ventricle has marked pressure and volume load, yet decreased coronary perfusion. Additional potential advantages include (1) improved development of the left pulmonary artery system because the source of pulmonary blood flow enters the pulmonary arteries more centrally, and (2) ability to easily perform second-stage bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis without need for CPB. The potential disadvantages of this technique are (1) a right ventriculotomy is required to place the conduit, which may lead to ventricular dysfunction and dysrhythmias; (2) damage to the pulmonary valve may occur at the time of the ventriculotomy; (3) excessive thrombosis is theoretically possible because of relative stasis during diastole; and (4) central pulmonary arterial distortion may occur.

One of the authors (FLH) has exclusively used a composite right ventricle–to–pulmonary trunk valved conduit for first-stage reconstruction since January 2002. R5 With this technique, it is immediately apparent that postoperative diastolic blood pressure is markedly improved (Fig. 49-20) compared with both preoperative diastolic blood pressure and traditional expectations for postoperative diastolic blood pressure using a standard systemic-pulmonary shunt. Early postoperative management is simplified, and hospital mortality as low as 8% can be achieved. Others have also noted these hemodynamic advantages. Over the past decade, use of the right ventricle–to–pulmonary trunk conduit has increased

Note marked improvement in diastolic blood pressure in all cases.

steadily, and currently it is chosen about as frequently as the systemic-to–pulmonary artery shunt.

Superiority of one technique over the other has not been unequivocally demonstrated, but a number of studies address this question. Many of these are retrospective singleinstitution studies and are not randomized; important reports are cited and discussed here. Mair and colleagues retrospectively evaluated 32 patients, 18 with a shunt and 14 with a right ventricle–to–pulmonary artery conduit.M3 They demonstrated better diastolic blood pressure, lower hospital and interstage mortality, and better ventricular function by catheterization at 3 months in the conduit group. There were no thrombotic events. One concern with this study is that the first 18 patients received shunts, and the last 14 conduits.

In another nonrandomized single-institution study of 66 patients, Cua and colleagues showed no difference in morbidity or mortality in 37 shunt patients and 29 conduit patients.C11 The conduit group had higher diastolic blood pressure, faster recovery, and shorter hospital stay. Ruffer and colleagues retrospectively analyzed 54 patients, 31 receiving a shunt and 23 a conduit.R8 Diastolic blood pressure was higher in the conduit group, and mortality was lower (8.7% vs. 19%, *P* = .12). Hospital length of stay and interstage mortality were similar. Pruetz and colleagues retrospectively report 159 cases, 103 receiving a shunt and 56 a conduit.P7 Mortality was 42% prior to second-stage surgery in the shunt group, compared with 23% in the conduit group. The left pulmonary artery grew more in the conduit group, but the pulmonary trunk was more likely to be hypoplastic. The conduit group was more likely to need reintervention prior to standard second-stage intervention. Caspi and colleagues showed that the Nakata index for conduit patients was greater (240 ± 18 mm2 · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> vs. 190 ± 10 mm2 · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , *P* = .03), and branch pulmonary arteries were more equal in size than those in shunt patients.C3

Graham and colleagues reported similar findings as well as higher diastolic blood pressure and lower right ventricular end-diastolic pressure in conduit patients at catheterization in preparation for second-stage intervention.G12 Pizzaro and colleagues demonstrated lower operative mortality in the conduit group compared with the shunt group (8% vs. 30%, *P* = .05) as well as less need for ventilator manipulation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and delayed sternal closure.P5 Tanoue and colleagues demonstrated that overall ventricular performance was comparable at midterm follow-up in both shunt and conduit groups.T2 Griselli and colleagues retrospectively evaluated 367 patients and showed lower hospital (15% vs. 31%, *P* < .05) and midterm (22% vs. 41%, *P* < .05) mortality in the conduit group.G13

Atallah and colleagues showed lower hospital and 2-year mortality in conduit patients compared with shunt patients, as well as improved psychomotor development; however, shunt patients underwent initial surgery between 1996 and 2002, whereas conduit patients underwent surgery between 2002 and 2005.A4 In contrast, Tabbutt and colleagues showed similar hospital and midterm survival and hospital length of stay in 149 patients (95 shunts, 54 conduits) but also an increased need for early reintervention in the conduit group.T1 Lai and colleagues reviewed 80 patients and showed similar early mortality in the conduit and shunt groups, but noted that six of 41 shunt survivors died before second-stage intervention, whereas none of the 29 conduit patients died. Morbidity and mortality associated with second-stage intervention were similar.L1

Several studies note the requirement for reintervention for inadequate Qp prior to standard second-stage intervention in patients who receive the right ventricle–to–pulmonary trunk conduit.D3,P7,R5,T1 Whether this is an intrinsic problem with the conduit procedure or part of the learning curve related to a relatively new technique is unclear at this time. When this problem occurs, it can be managed either by surgical or interventional revision of the conduitD3,P7,T1 or by placing a systemic–to–pulmonary artery shunt, preferably with takedown of the conduit.H6 The question is whether or not right ventricular function is impaired as a result of the right ventriculotomy or other factors related to the conduit procedure.

Although there are currently no definitive answers, several studiesG12,M3,T2 and the literature review by Raja and colleaguesR1 indicate that there is no evidence that right ventricular function is impaired either early or at midterm follow-up. A single randomized prospective multicenter study comparing the right ventricle–to–pulmonary trunk conduit with the systemic artery–to–pulmonary artery shunt has been performed.O5 Fifteen institutions enrolled 549 patients. Transplantation-free 1-year survival was higher in the conduit group (74% vs. 64%, *P* = .01). The hazard function for death is higher for shunt patients from month 1 to month 12 after operation, becomes equal to that for conduit patients from months 13 to 36, then again rises above the hazard for conduit patients from months 36 to 48 (see Fig. 49-13). Unintended reinterventions were higher in the conduit group. Ventricular function was similar in both groups.

To summarize, current evidence suggests that the right ventricle–to–pulmonary trunk conduit is associated with improved early and midterm survival and more favorable early hemodynamics, including diastolic blood pressure and shorter hospital length of stay, and does not negatively affect right ventricular performance at midterm follow-up. Branch pulmonary artery development may be improved. An increased number of unintended procedures have been documented using this technique, but it is likely these will decrease as experience with the technique grows.

# Hybrid versus Norwood Procedure

It is difficult to compare these two procedures, mainly because hybrid procedures are usually performed in higher-risk patients. Despite this, a direct comparison of early mortality after neonatal surgery suggests that hybrid outcomes are at least as good as Norwood outcomes. Interstage and secondstage mortality, however, appear to be higher. The only study that examines outcomes following the Norwood procedure and the hybrid procedure in matched high-risk patient cohorts suggests that survival is similarP4 (Fig. 49-21).
