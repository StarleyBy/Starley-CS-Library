# DEFINITION

*Acute aortic dissection* is an event of sudden onset in which blood leaves the normal aortic lumen through a usually discrete point of exit (intimal tear) and rapidly dissects inner from outer layers of the media to produce a false lumen. However, dissection of the media can occur in the absence of an intimal tear. Patients are considered to have an acute dissection when the process is less than 14 days old, and a chronic dissection thereafter (see "Chronic Aortic Dissection" under Morphology and Morphogenesis in Chapter 26).

## HISTORICAL NOTE

Aortic dissection was recognized in the 16th century, but knowledge of many of its aspects was incomplete and confused.D8 Laennec introduced the term *dissecting aneurysm* in 1819. Shennan's 1934 treatise was a landmark in developing knowledge of this entity, documenting among other things its seriousness.S11 Surgical treatment began in the mid-1930s. Early operations were indirect, consisting of creating a distal internal fenestration (reentry passage) between true and false lumens or attempting to restore circulation directly to major branches sheared off by the dissection.G13,S10 With failure of these methods, surgical attention turned to the tendency of the false lumen to rupture, and efforts were directed by Paullin and James in 1948 to wrapping the area of dissection and by Johns in 1953 to suturing the rupture.J3,P6

Modern treatment of aortic dissection is a contribution of DeBakey, who in 1955 reported the successful outcome of an operation performed in 1954 in which the aneurysmal descending thoracic aorta resulting from dilatation of the false lumen was resected, entry into the false lumen distally oversewn, and end-to-end anastomosis performed.D6 Subsequently, DeBakey and colleagues devised a classification of aortic dissection that is widely used today (see "Morphology" later in this chapter).D8 The first successful repair of chronic ascending aortic dissection with aortic regurgitation was reported in 1962 by Spencer and Blake in a patient with chronic dissection, although the procedure was proposed by Bahnson and Spencer in 1960.B4,S19 Spencer and Blake carried out the operation that is currently widely used, including suspension of aortic valve commissures. The first successful repair of acute ascending aortic dissection with aortic regurgitation was reported by Morris and colleagues in Houston in 1963.M13 Moderate aortic regurgitation persisted postoperatively, and 15 years later the regurgitation was severe, with moderate heart failure. Aortography showed a persisting double lumen that extended distally to the aortic bifurcation. Aortic valve replacement was performed in 1977.L6 The patient continued to be well in 1989 (Morris GC: personal communication, 1989). Further successful surgical experiences with acute dissection of the ascending aorta were reported by DeBakey and colleagues in 1964.D7 In 1965, Wheat and colleagues demonstrated the possibility of improving management of acute aortic dissection by medical measures directed at controlling arterial hypertension while maintaining adequate organ perfusion.W4

Technological improvements in cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuitry and in synthetic replacements for the involved aortic segments have contributed to improved outcomes following surgical treatment of acute aortic dissection. Use of hypothermic circulatory arrest, described initially by Barnard 1

and Schrire and by Borst and colleagues in the early 1960s to treat aneurysms and other conditions involving the aortic arch, and applied systematically by Griepp and colleagues in a series of patients described in 1975, permitted extension of operative procedures into the aortic arch.B7,B21,G10 In 1982, Livesay and colleagues described a technique for open distal anastomosis in treating both ascending aortic aneurysms and dissections, a technique that is now widely used.L13 Use of gelatin-resorcinol-formaldehyde (GRF) glue to strengthen the disrupted layers of the aorta before they are approximated and sutured directly or to an aortic graft was described in 1979 by Guilmet and colleagues in France.G12 It is extensively used in Europe and in other parts of the world but is not approved for use in the United States. BioGlue,1 an albumin and glutaraldehyde-based adhesive, has been approved for this purpose in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Kato and colleagues in Tsu, Japan, and Dake and colleagues at Stanford University introduced endovascular stent-grafting initially to manage vascular ischemic complications of acute aortic dissection, then to exclude the primary tear in the descending thoracic aorta. The combined experience of these two groups was reported in *The New England Journal of Medicine,* which focused not only on early mortality and morbidity, but also specifically on the fate of the false lumen 5 to 28 months after stent-grafting.D2

# MORPHOLOGY

## Morphologic Substrates

In many patients in whom an aortic dissection develops, the aortic wall shows only changes commensurate with patient age.D3,H6,L5,S7,S22 Thus, it appears that once blood enters the aortic media, cleavage of concentric elastic lamellar plates can occur in even an essentially normal aorta; this event permits rapid and extensive dissection. Dissection usually proceeds distally but may also extend proximally.

*Medial degeneration* (cystic medial necrosis) of the aorta of a greater degree than is normal for age is present in about 20% of patients with acute aortic dissection and may predispose to dissection.L5,S8 Rarely, aortitis is a predisposing factor.H5

*Marfan syndrome* is an important morphologic substrate for acute aortic dissection, and acute dissection develops in 20% to 40% of patients with this syndrome.H5,R9,W6 In fact, aortic root dissection and rupture and chronic aortic regurgitation are the primary causes of death in these patients.M5,M14 Many patients with Marfan syndrome and aortic dissection exhibit no medial degeneration; therefore, this syndrome appears to be, per se, a risk factor for acute dissection.L5

Defective synthesis of fibrillin, a glycoprotein that is an important component of elastic tissue in the medial layer of the aorta, has been demonstrated in patients with Marfan syndrome.F10,S3 The genetic defect of Marfan syndrome and the fibrillin gene have been mapped to the same region in the long arm of chromosome 15.K1,M1 *Turner, Noonan, vascular Ehlers-Danlos,* and *Loeys-Dietz syndromes* are other genetic disorders associated with aortic dissection.A4,G6,L8,L14,S9,S16,S17,S21

A genetic basis of *nonsyndromic familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection* has recently been defined.B14,C4

*Anuloectasia* without Marfan syndrome is present in some patients in whom acute dissection of the ascending aorta develops. It is important to recognize anuloectasia when it coexists, because aortic root replacement rather than cusp resuspension is indicated (see "Indications for Operation, Selection of Technique, and Choice of Device" in Chapter 12).

A *bicuspid aortic valve* is frequently associated with acute aortic dissection.A1,E3,R8 In the study of Larson and Edwards, the process of acute dissection occurred nine times as frequently in patients with bicuspid as in those with tricuspid aortic valves.L5 There may be a higher prevalence of congenital abnormalities of the aortic wall in patients with bicuspid than in those with tricuspid valves.E3,L9

A *dilated ascending aorta* (>5.0-5.5 cm) occurring in combination with anuloectasia (with or without Marfan syndrome), with a bicuspid aortic valve, or with previous aortic valve replacement is associated with increased risk of aortic dissection.G8,L5,P9

The role of *arteriosclerosis* in development of acute aortic dissection has been debated.R7 It is probably not a predisposing lesion, although occasionally an intimal tear may develop in a penetrating arteriosclerotic ulcer, resulting in dissection of the media.B23,L5

*Aortic coarctation* is associated with acute dissection, but this is likely due to *systemic arterial hypertension,* an important risk factor for developing acute aortic dissection.H5 Bicuspid aortic valve and an abnormal ascending aorta, frequently present in patients with coarctation, may also be contributing factors.E2,L9,R7

The role of *pregnancy* in genesis of acute aortic dissection is unresolved.O5 *Closed chest trauma* may rarely result in true aortic dissection, as may *aortic cannulation* and *aortic clamping* during operations employing CPB.B16,G7,R7,S20,W6

*Intramural hematoma* may be a precursor of aortic dissection.N5,Z3 It likely results from rupture of vasa vasorum and may, in its initial stages, exist in the absence of an intimal tear (see text that follows).G6,W6

# Intimal Tear

Controversy exists as to whether an intimal tear is consistently present in acute aortic dissection and, thus, whether an intimal tear is a requisite for dissection.D9,O1 One point of view is that rupture of aortic vasa vasorum is the inciting event and that it initiates an intramedial hemorrhage and subsequent dissection.G6,W6 This hypothesis is supported by studies of the role of intramural hematoma as a precursor of aortic dissection and by intraoperative and postmortem observations of aortic dissection without the presence of an intimal tear.D11,N5,R4,U4,Y1,Z3 However, Larson and Edwards found an intimal tear in each of 158 specimens personally examined, supporting the hypothesis of the primacy of an intimal tear, a view held by Murray and Edwards and by Roberts.L5,M15,R7 The intimal tear develops commonly in the ascending aorta but also in the upper descending aorta just beyond the origin of the left subclavian artery. In the latter instance, dissection usually proceeds only distally (antegrade) but may extend proximally (retrograde) as far as the ascending aorta. Proximal dissection occurred in 38% (CL 29%-47%) of autopsied cases studied by Larson and Edwards.L5 The intimal tear originates in the aortic arch in about 10% to 20% of patients and dissection is both retrograde into the ascending aorta and antegrade into the descending thoracic aorta.H2,O1,R6 Rarely, the intimal tear is low in the descending thoracic or abdominal aorta.R5

#### Dissection

When medial dissection occurs, the walls of any of the branches of the aorta may be involved with the dissection, may be sheared off from the lumen and occluded by the dissecting media and intima, may stay in communication with the aorta but only by the false lumen, or may be uninvolved. Extension of dissection into the branch wall is more common in large arteries such as the brachiocephalic, carotid, subclavian, and renal than in smaller ones. Dissection more frequently involves the left rather than right iliac artery. Extent and nature of involvement of the branches, including coronary and iliac arteries, is an important determinant of the clinical syndrome with which the patient presents.

#### False Lumen

The false lumen develops in the outer half of the aortic media; as a consequence, its external wall is thinner than the internal wall (dissecting membrane).R7 The false lumen usually involves half to two thirds of the circumference of the aorta and rarely the entire circumference. Although the false lumen may be contained initially by the thin outer layer of media and adventitia, it often ruptures into the pericardium, the pleural space (usually the left), or less commonly, the abdomen. Even when initial rupture does not occur, blood from the false lumen may extravasate through weak areas of media and adventitia to form a mediastinal or pericardial hematoma.

Usually, the false lumen gradually enlarges as time passes, producing a marked increase in wall thickness and size of involved portions of the aorta. In many instances, aortic enlargement in the acute stage is diffuse and does not reach aneurysmal proportions. In the ensuing years, the thin outer wall of the false aneurysm tends to weaken, the lumen tends to become aneurysmal, and eventually rupture may occur. The false lumen may become partially or totally thrombosed.

## Types of Aortic Dissection

Two classifications of aortic dissection are widely used (Fig. 25-1): DeBakeyD8 and Stanford (Box 25-1).D1 In DeBakey type I or Stanford type A dissection, the intimal tear is usually located in the anterior wall of the proximal portion of the ascending aorta. Occasionally it is in the aortic arch and less commonly in the descending aorta distal to the left subclavian artery.D8,H2,L5,M10,O1,R6 Aortic valve regurgitation and myocardial infarction (MI) may result from extension of the dissection into the most proximal portion of the ascending aorta and the aortic root. In DeBakey type II dissection, only the ascending aorta is involved, and dissection terminates proximal to the brachiocephalic artery. This type may be found incidentally during operations for ascending aortic aneurysms. In DeBakey type III or Stanford type B dissection, the dissecting hematoma may involve only the descending thoracic aorta (DeBakey type IIIa), but most commonly extends into the abdominal aorta and occasionally into the iliac arteries (DeBakey type IIIb). It may also extend proximally into the aortic arch and the ascending aorta. In these types, the

#### **Box 25-1** Classification of Aortic Dissection

## **DeBakey Classification**

- Type I. Intimal tear usually originates in the proximal ascending aorta and dissection involves ascending aorta, arch, and variable lengths of descending thoracic and abdominal aorta.
- Type II. Dissection is confined to ascending aorta.
- Type III. Dissection may be confined to descending thoracic aorta (type IIIa) or may extend into the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries (type IIIb). Dissection may also extend proximally to involve the arch and the ascending aorta.

# **Stanford Classification**

- Type A. All cases in which ascending aorta is involved by dissection, with or without involvement of the arch and descending thoracic aorta.
- Type B. Cases in which only descending thoracic aorta is involved; however, occasionally, dissections originating in the descending thoracic aorta extend proximally (retrograde) to include the aortic arch but not the ascending aorta, and others originating in the aortic arch remain localized or extend distally (antegrade) without involving the ascending aorta; in this text these are included in type B.

intimal tear is usually located just distal to the left subclavian artery. The proportion of patients with the various types of dissection depends on the nature of the series reported. In the large surgical series of DeBakey and colleagues, which contained both acute and chronic dissections, type I and type II dissections comprised about 35% of cases.D8 In other clinical and autopsy series, acute dissections involved the ascending aorta in 62% to 85% of cases.C8,H2,L5,L10

# CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

# Hemodynamic State

*Sudden death* may be the presenting feature, occurring shortly after onset of dissection, with free rupture of the false lumen through the thin outer wall into the pericardial, pleural, or peritoneal space. Sudden death can also follow shearing off of the coronary arteries from their aortic origins.

Alternatively, the presentation may be *hypovolemic shock* of varying degree. It may be the immediate result of acute dissection with loss of a considerable amount of blood from the false lumen into periaortic tissues and spaces. It may also result from development of acute aortic regurgitation when the dissection shears off the aortic attachment of valve commissures, which occurs in 35% to 60% of patients with acute dissection involving the ascending aorta.F5,L5,L12 It may also be the result of acute cardiac tamponade after the site of rupture into the pericardium has temporarily sealed off. As time passes after the acute event, often with some improvement in arterial hypotension, further extravasation of blood can occur from the false lumen into periaortic tissues or spaces, leading to further hypovolemia and a worsening hemodynamic state.

In some patients, the *hemodynamic state is good* after the immediate event, and acute extravasation from the false lumen or rupture of the lumen may not occur for hours, days, or years, if at all. In a few patients, acute dissection results in *no symptoms* and passes unnoticed.

## Demographics and Syndromes

Most patients (80%-90%) presenting with acute aortic dissection are age 60 or older and have a history of arterial hypertension. Severe acute arterial hypertension, such as occurs in weight lifters, appears to predispose to acute dissection, particularly of the ascending aorta.D5 Use of cocaine, which induces hypertension and vasoconstriction, has also been associated with acute aortic dissection.R2 Patients with acute dissection involving the ascending aorta tend to be younger than those with more distal dissections; thus, the mean age of patients with ascending aortic dissections in the experience of Fann and colleagues was 56 ± 14 years (range 15-85 years), whereas that of patients with involvement of only the descending aorta and beyond was 64 ± 13 years (range 32-86 years).F5 Some patients have evidence of Marfan syndrome; in others, dissection develops during pregnancy. A few have a history of coarctation or its repair or previous aortic valve surgery (see Morphology earlier in this chapter).P9 Occasionally, acute aortic dissection occurs in patients with Turner, Noonan, vascular Ehlers-Danlos, and Loeys-Dietz syndromes.A4,G6,L8,M8,R1,S9,S17,S21 In patients with these syndromes, dissection develops at a younger age, generally during the third or fourth decade of life. In them, and in younger persons in general, there is likely to be no history of hypertension, and dissection usually originates in the ascending aorta. Patients with nonsyndromic familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection present at a younger age than patients with sporadic (non-genetically mediated) disease, but are older than patients with Marfan or Loeys-Dietz syndrome.B14,C4

# Symptoms and Signs

Although dissection may be painless and at times unknown to the patient, most patients experience sudden severe pain at the moment of dissection and a feeling of impending death. The pain is often interscapular, but it may be precordial and radiate into the neck or arms. It is at times difficult to distinguish from angina pectoris. Once acute dissection occurs, symptoms and signs can be produced by occlusion of a major vessel. Arch vessel occlusion causes stroke in 5% to 10% of patients with type I dissection.F5 One leg (more commonly the left than right) may suddenly become numb, pale, and pulseless as dissection occludes the iliac artery or aortic bifurcation. Occasionally, the same process causes pulses to diminish or disappear in an upper extremity. Uncommonly (2%-5% of patientsD8,F4), paraplegia suddenly develops as intercostal arteries are separated from the aortic lumen by dissection. Oliguria or anuria may appear with occlusion of the aortic origin of the renal arteries.

## Chest Radiography

The chest radiograph frequently exhibits widening of the mediastinal shadow, particularly in its upper part and toward the left in DeBakey types I and III dissections. There may be cardiomegaly secondary to pericardial effusion or signs of pleural effusion, particularly in the left hemithorax. The aortic shadow is frequently prominent. However, as a diagnostic test, chest radiography is inadequately sensitive to definitively exclude the presence of aortic dissection in all but the lowestrisk patients.K13 Sensitivity is lower for pathology confined to the ascending aorta than for disease involving distal aortic segments.V3

## Imaging Studies

#### *Echocardiography*

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) with Doppler color flow imaging is emerging as the most useful and accurate diagnostic technique.A2,B6,E7,N4,S15 It is distinctly superior to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and can be performed relatively rapidly with minimal morbidity. When TEE was compared with aortography or with findings at operation or autopsy, its sensitivity and specificity for type A dissection ranged from 88% to 100% and from 86% to 100%, respectively, and for type B dissection from 98% to 100% and from 96% to 100%, respectively.B6,E7,N4,S12,S15 In addition to identifying the dissecting membrane (Fig. 25-2, *A*), TEE can identify pericardial fluid, evidence for pericardial tamponade, aortic regurgitation, involvement of proximal coronary arteries in

TTE may be useful in critically ill patients to establish a diagnosis rapidly.V1 However, absence of positive findings does not preclude the presence of an acute dissection, and other diagnostic studies become necessary.N4

Computed tomography (CT) with use of contrast material is useful for diagnosing and delineating acute aortic dissection.S18 It produces excellent images with relatively short scanning times (Fig. 25-3). Because CT scanning equipment

is available in emergency departments of most hospitals, CT is the most widely used diagnostic technique for aortic dissection. Advantages include ability to image the entire aorta including lumen, wall, and periaortic regions; identify anatomic variants and branch vessel involvement; and distinguish between the various acute aortic syndromes (intramural hematoma, penetrating arteriosclerotic ulcer, and acute aortic dissection). Electrocardiographic-gated techniques have made it possible to generate motion-free images of the aortic root and coronary arteries. Reports using newergeneration multidetector helical CT scanners have noted sensitivities of up to 100% and specificities of 98% to 99%.S12,S18,Y6 In comparative studies, however, CT has lower sensitivity and specificity than either TEE or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (see later).B6,E7,N4,S12 Dissection may be obscured by complete thrombosis of one lumen or similar opacification in both true and false lumens. Location of entry site and presence of aortic regurgitation cannot always be accurately determined. The technique requires use of contrast medium for accurate delineation of aortic pathology and may be contraindicated in patients with allergies to contrast agents or with renal insufficiency.

# *Magnetic Resonance Imaging*

MRI is emerging as a premier imaging method for diagnosing diseases of the thoracic aorta, including acute aortic dissection. It does not require use of contrast medium. In some situations, a single study can provide information similar to that obtained from a combination of echocardiography, CT, and aortography, with high sensitivity and specificity.L11,N3,N4,S12 It provides superb imaging of both ascending and descending thoracic aortic dissections and can accurately identify sites of entry and thrombus formation (Fig. 25-4).N3,N4 MR angiography (MRA) using gadolinium, a contrast agent, further enhances its utility.P10 Disadvantages of MRI compared with CT and TEE include a longer time to complete the study, greater cost, inaccessibility to patients who are connected to ventilators and monitoring devices, and limited availability.

#### *Aortography*

Despite advances in noninvasive and minimally invasive techniques for diagnosing acute aortic dissection, aortography

(From Nienaber and colleagues.N3)

remains an important and highly accurate method for establishing the diagnosis. It is the benchmark against which other diagnostic studies are measured.B6,N3,N4 The false lumen can be visualized, as can at times the intimal tear (Fig. 25-5). It provides accurate information about branch artery involvement and presence of aortic valve regurgitation. It is an essential component of interventional procedures to treat acute aortic dissection, such as fenestration and endovascular stent-grafting (see "Special Situations and Controversies" later). Disadvantages of aortography compared with other diagnostic methods include need for arterial access and introduction of wires and catheters into the aorta, potential for false-negative results if the false lumen is thrombosed, risk of allergic reactions to contrast medium, and renal failure in patients with impaired renal function.

In the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD), which included 618 patients with acute aortic dissection who had imaging studies between January 1996 and December 1999, the order for which the imaging studies were performed was known in 604 patients (98%).M11 Among these, CT was performed first in 379 (63%), TEE in 192 (32%), aortography in 24 (4%), and MRI in 9 (1%). Among the 396 patients with a second study, TEE was performed in 229 (58%), CT in 68 (17%), aortography in 61 (15%), and MRI in 38 (10%). Data from the IRAD centers demonstrated a high diagnostic sensitivity for all four imaging modalities. However, false-negative CT, TEE, and aortography studies were frequent, so diagnosis of acute aortic dissection could not be confidently excluded on the basis of negative findings of a single test.M11 The authors strongly recommended a second imaging study if the initial diagnostic test did not identify aortic dissection when the diagnosis was suspected clinically.

#### *Coronary Angiography*

Selective coronary angiography to identify coronary artery involvement in acute ascending aortic dissection is not usually indicated, because this can be determined by TEE preoperatively or intraoperatively (see Fig. 25-2, *B*) and by direct examination of the coronary arteries after the aorta has been opened. Use of coronary angiography to detect arteriosclerotic coronary artery disease in patients who are to undergo surgical treatment of acute ascending aortic dissection is arguable (see Special Situations and Controversies later in this chapter).

#### Differential Diagnosis

Symptoms associated with acute aortic dissection can mimic those of acute MI. The electrocardiogram (ECG) may demonstrate myocardial ischemia, and serum creatine kinase may be elevated.D4,S4 Because thrombolytic therapy is frequently administered to patients with acute MI and ST-segment abnormalities, thrombolytic agents might be administered to patients with acute aortic dissection with potentially disastrous results.B26,W5 *ST-segment elevation* occurs rarely in acute aortic dissectionW3; however, *ST-segment depression* occurs more commonly and was noted in 16 of 50 (32%; CL 25%-39%) patients analyzed by Weiss and colleagues.W3 Thus, thrombolytic therapy can be safely administered to patients with ST-segment elevation and no physical signs of aortic dissection without need for further diagnostic studies. Additional studies may be indicated before thrombolytic agents are given to patients with ST-segment depression or other ECG evidence of myocardial ischemia.

vian artery and extends into abdominal aorta.

Several serum markers have been investigated for their utility in diagnosing acute aortic dissection and differentiating it from other conditions associated with acute onset of chest pain, such as MI and pulmonary embolism. D-dimer, a degradation product of cross-linked fibrin in thrombus, is sensitive for ongoing intravascular thrombosis. It is highly elevated in patients with acute aortic dissection, with a sensitivity in pooled studies of 94% (95% CL, 91%-96%).E4,M2 It is also highly elevated in patients with acute pulmonary embolism.E4 The lower specificity (40%-100%) in the pooled studies is not of sufficient magnitude to exclude the diagnosis, however, and in general, other diagnostic studies are required.M2 Using 64-slice CT scanners, it is possible to establish or exclude a diagnosis of acute aortic dissection, acute pulmonary embolism, and obstructive coronary artery disease (the so-called triple rule-out CT), and this diagnostic study is being used with increasing frequency.E5,S5,U3

# NATURAL HISTORY

Acute aortic dissection is a serious event, and the natural history of patients who have sustained it is related primarily to type and extent of the dissection and to the nature and severity of complications that may follow.

## Survival

Information about survival of nonsurgically treated patients is sparse, but some general inferences may be drawn. Between 40% and 90% of patients survive 24 hours or more after the dissection, but this generalization ignores the well-established difference in prognosis between type A and type B dissections (Fig. 25-6, *A*).A5,H5,M9,M16,S11,T7,V1 The hazard function for death also appears to be different in these two types of dissection (Fig. 25-6, *B*). Type B has a rapidly declining early hazard phase, a constant phase, and a rising late hazard phase beginning about 2 years after dissection; type A dissection has a rapidly declining early hazard phase and only a constant phase thereafter.

Involvement of the ascending aorta or aortic arch is, then, a risk factor for early death in patients with acute dissection.

![](_page_7_Figure_7.jpeg)

**Figure 25-6** Survival with nonsurgical treatment after acute aortic dissection, according to whether dissection involves ascending aorta with or without involvement of the arch (type A) (*n* = 60), or only the descending aorta beyond the left subclavian artery (type B) (*n* = 74). Depiction derived from original data by transforming survivorship estimates into the hazard function domain (see "Time-Related Events" in Section IV of Chapter 6). **A,** Survival. **B,** Hazard function for death. (From Masuda and colleagues.M4)

Hypertension is an important risk factor in untreated patients, both by inciting the intimal tear and unfavorably affecting survival once dissection occurs. Large size of the dissected aorta is also a risk factor.M4 Complete or near-complete thrombosis of the false lumen appears to reduce risk of subsequent rupture and death.H5,N1,Y3

#### Modes of Death

Most patients who die acutely succumb from false lumen rupture with hemopericardium, hemomediastinum, or hemothorax. Deaths later in the early period after dissection can result from delayed rupture or organ dysfunction secondary to arterial occlusions.

## Course after Surviving Acute Aortic Dissection

Patients surviving acute dissection continue to be at greater risk of dying than the general population. This is because the false lumen generally persists (see Morphology [earlier] and Results [later]), usually and gradually becomes aneurysmal, and may rupture months or years after the acute episode. Also, a new dissection (redissection) may occur in a previously uninvolved portion of the wall of the aorta and present new risks.

# TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

# Purpose of Surgical Treatment

Operation for acute aortic dissection is performed to prevent death from cardiac tamponade or exsanguination by excising and repairing or replacing areas of actual or impending rupture and, wherever possible, restoring blood flow to branches of the aorta that have been occluded by the dissection. Operation does not remove the entire false lumen in most patients. To this extent, operation is palliative rather than curative. Another purpose of operation when dissection involves the ascending aorta is to correct acutely developed or chronic coexisting aortic valve regurgitation. Resuspending detached commissures or replacing the aortic valve may be necessary. Replacing the aortic root may be required in some instances, and this is accomplished with a composite graft, an aortic allograft, or a stentless xenograft.

## Repair of Acute DeBakey Type I or II (Type A) Dissection

## *General Considerations*

Usual preparations are made for operations in which CPB is used (see Sections III and IV in Chapter 2). Pressures are monitored in the right radial artery and in the femoral artery opposite the cannulation site to promptly detect obstruction to retrograde flow within the aortic arch after CPB is established. Doppler sonography of the extracranial carotid arteries and monitoring of cerebral oxygen saturation are useful techniques for detecting compromised blood flow in brachiocephalic arteries.A8,C5,J1

The common femoral artery with the most normal pulse is exposed through a small vertical or oblique incision in the inguinal fold. If dissection is present upon opening it, the lumen in which blood is flowing should be cannulated. This may be either the false or the true lumen. In some cases, effective retrograde arterial perfusion may not be possible, because the aorta becomes obstructed (see "Malperfusion Syndromes" later under Special Situations and Controversies). In this situation, provisions should be made for antegrade aortic perfusion through the ascending aorta, aortic arch, or apex of the left ventricle, or for perfusion of an axillary artery or the opposite femoral artery (see "Cardiopulmonary Bypass Established by Peripheral Cannulation" under Special Situations and Controversies in Section III of Chapter 2).B13,B20,R10,S2 If it is necessary to establish CPB urgently, the right common femoral vein should be used because the long venous cannula can be more easily positioned in the right atrium from the right side.

After median sternotomy, the pericardium is incised and stay sutures placed. The often hemorrhagic ascending aorta is not disturbed at this point (Fig. 25-7, *A*). If dissection is confined to the ascending aorta (DeBakey type II) and hypothermic circulatory arrest is not needed, a single two-stage

After incising outer layer of aorta, origin of intimal tear is often visualized just distal to aortic valve. Cardioplegic solution is infused directly into coronary arteries whenever possible for optimal myocardial management. **C,** Aortic wall is transected circumferentially 4 to 5 mm above level of aortic commissures.

**D,** Pledgeted, double-armed, polypropylene sutures are placed across each detached commissure and through outer layer of aorta, and are tied over a second pledget. *Inset:* Gelatin-resorcinol-formaldehyde or other glue may be used to obliterate false lumen. **E,** Disrupted layers of aorta are approximated between strips of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) felt or pericardium and are secured with multiple polypropylene mattress sutures. **Figure 25-7, cont'd**

cannula for venous drainage can be inserted through a pursestring suture into the right atrial appendage. TEE is useful in making this determination. In all other situations, pursestring sutures are placed for cannulation of both superior and inferior venae cavae.

After heparinization, the femoral artery and right atrium or the venae cavae are cannulated, CPB established, and the patient's body temperature reduced. If only the ascending aorta requires repair and circulatory arrest is not required, perfusate temperature is taken to 28°C to 32°C and flow rate appropriately reduced. If circulatory arrest is necessary, the patient's body temperature is reduced to less than 20°C. A venting catheter is inserted through the right superior pulmonary vein and advanced into the left ventricle (see "Commencing Cardiopulmonary Bypass and Left Heart Venting" in Section III of Chapter 2). A balloon-tipped catheter is placed into the coronary sinus through a purse-string suture in the right atrium for delivery of retrograde cardioplegia (see "Technique of Retrograde Infusion" in Chapter 3).

Limited dissection is carried out, carefully separating the ascending aorta from the pulmonary trunk proximal to the origin of the brachiocephalic artery, and the aorta is clamped at this point after transiently reducing CPB flow to a low level (0.5 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ). Whenever possible, the clamp should be placed several centimeters proximal to the brachiocephalic artery to avoid further injury and fragmentation of the aorta at a site where an anastomosis to a graft may be performed. A longitudinal incision is made in the ascending aorta extending to, but not into, the noncoronary sinus (Fig. 25-7, *B*). This incision often enters into the false lumen, which is

**F,** This cuff is sutured to a prepared woven polyester graft using a continuous polypropylene suture. Note that cut ends of layers of aorta extend beyond bolster. **G,** With DeBakey type II dissection, intact ascending aorta beyond dissection is completely transected and sutured to distal end of aortic graft with a continuous polypropylene suture incorporating a strip of PTFE felt or pericardium. **H,** Completed procedure. A pledgeted polypropylene suture is used to seal site of insertion of a needle vent for aspiration of air. **Figure 25-7, cont'd**

usually anterior and to the right of the true lumen. If clot is present in the false lumen, it is carefully removed. The dissecting membrane is incised, and retraction sutures are placed in the aortic wall. Cardioplegic solution is promptly infused into the coronary ostia. Retrograde cardioplegia should be administered if the coronary ostia are compromised by the dissection (see "Methods of Myocardial Management during Cardiac Surgery" in Chapter 3). Cardioplegic solution is infused every 12 to 15 minutes. External cooling of the ventricles with topical slush or a cooling jacket may also be used. The interior of the ascending aorta is examined and the aortic wall transected circumferentially 4 to 5 mm above the level of the aortic commissures (Fig. 25-7, *C*).

## *Management of Aortic Root*

**Repair of Disrupted but Nonectatic Aortic Root** If one or more aortic valve cusps have been separated from the outer aortic wall by the dissecting hematoma with consequent cusp prolapse, a pledgeted 4-0 double-armed polypropylene mattress suture is placed across each affected commissure and through the outer layer of the aorta, and is tied over a second felt pledget (Fig. 25-7, *D*). The coronary arteries are carefully examined, and if dissection extends to one or both ostia but the coronary artery is intact, divided layers of the aorta surrounding the ostium are approximated with pledgeted 4-0 polypropylene sutures. Aortic wall surrounding the involved coronary artery is mobilized, and these sutures are tied on the outside of the aorta. If dissection completely surrounds a coronary ostium, a 3- to 4-mm button of both layers of the aorta surrounding the ostium is excised, and the divided layers are approximated with a 5-0 or 6-0 running polypropylene suture. This button can be attached to the ascending aortic graft or to an interposed segment of saphenous vein or 8-mm collagen- or gelatin-impregnated woven or knitted polyester graft (see "Ascending Aorta Replacement" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 26).

If dissection extends into the coronary artery, most commonly the right, repair may be possible. Alternatively, an interposition or bypass graft of saphenous vein or polyester is sutured to the uninvolved artery beyond the dissection in an end-to-end or end-to-side fashion, and the proximal end is anastomosed to the ascending aortic graft. If the end-toside technique is used, the coronary artery is ligated proximal to the anastomosis. Disrupted layers of the aorta are approximated using 4- to 5-mm strips of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) felt placed in the lumen and outside the aorta. This is accomplished with multiple mattress sutures of 4-0 or 5-0 polypropylene (Fig. 25-7, *E*).

Alternatively, strips of autologous or bovine pericardium may be used. This cuff, containing the two strips of felt (or pericardium) and the two layers of the aorta, is sutured to a collagen- or gelatin-impregnated woven polyester graft with a continuous 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture (Fig. 25-7, *F*). Occasionally, use of 5-0 polypropylene suture may be indicated because of thinness and friability of aortic tissue. Diameter of the graft should be 10% to 15% smaller than the diameter of the aortic anulus to ensure adequate coaptation of the aortic cusps. The separated layers of the aorta can also be approximated using GRF or other glue (see Fig. 25-7, *D,* inset).

**Replacement of Structurally Abnormal or Diseased Aortic Valve** Occasionally, resuspension of the aortic valve is inadequate and replacement is necessary. The aortic valve may also require replacement if it is structurally abnormal. If the aortic root is not dilated, the aortic valve is excised and replaced (see "Replacement of Aortic Valve and Ascending Aorta, En Bloc" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 12). Dissected layers of the aorta in the region of the coronary sinuses and the coronary ostia are managed as described earlier under "Repair of Disrupted but Nonectatic Aortic Root." The ascending aortic graft is sutured to the reinforced cuff of aorta at or just above the level of the aortic commissures, as shown in Fig. 25-7, *F*.

**Management of Ectatic Aortic Root** In patients with preexisting dilatation of the aortic sinuses and sinutubular junction, combined replacement of the aortic valve, aortic sinuses, and ascending aorta is the preferred method of treatment.G8,G11,K16,K17 These abnormalities are frequently encountered in patients with Marfan syndrome but may also be present in patients without this condition. Replacement with a composite graft containing a mechanical valve and a polyester tube graft is the most widely used technique.G8,K16 Conduits containing xenograft valves may be used in elderly patients or those in whom long-term anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated or inadvisable. Aortic root allografts and pulmonary root autografts can also be used.K17 Valve-sparing procedures in combination with reconfiguration of the aortic root are only rarely indicated in patients with acute aortic dissection, because these operations are lengthy and complex. Such procedures are described under "Repair of Aortic Valve Regurgitation Caused by Aortic Dilatation or Aneurysm" in Chapter 12.

Occasionally, aortic root replacement may be advisable in the absence of ectatic aortic sinuses when there is marked disruption of layers of the aorta in this area. The aortic anulus is generally unaffected by the dissection and provides a secure area for attaching a composite graft or an aortic allograft.K17 The coronary arteries are repaired, if necessary, and attached to the graft directly or to interposed segments of saphenous vein or polyester grafts.

## *DeBakey Type II Dissection*

In these infrequent cases, dissection is confined to the ascending aorta, and the distal graft-to-aorta anastomosis is made to undissected aortic tissue. If dissection involves only the proximal ascending aorta, the aortic clamp is placed just proximal to the origin of the brachiocephalic artery (Fig. 25-7, *G*). The aorta is completely transected and sutured to the aortic graft with a continuous 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture incorporating a strip of PTFE felt (see Fig. 25-7, *G*-*H*).

The interposition method of graft insertion is preferred for replacing the ascending aorta. Use of collagen- or gelatinimpregnated polyester grafts, fine suture (4-0 or 5-0 polypropylene), strips of PTFE felt or pericardium (see Fig. 25-7, *G*), and biological glues has substantially reduced severity of bleeding through graft interstices and from anastomotic suture lines. The older graft inclusion technique favored by some surgeons (see "Historical Note" in Chapter 26) is not recommended, because hemostasis and approximation of dissected layers of the aorta may be less secure, and because wrapping the aorta around the graft to reduce bleeding through graft interstices is no longer necessary.

Intraluminal sutureless prostheses have been used to treat both acute and chronic dissections of the ascending aorta.A4,B8,D13,L7 Woven polyester grafts of varying lengths with a felt-covered metal spool at each end are available for this.2 Cloth tapes are placed around the aorta proximal and distal to the incision in the ascending aorta. After the aorta is clamped distally and opened longitudinally, the device is inserted into the aorta and is secured with the tapes, which are tied over the grooves in the proximal and distal spools. Obstruction of orifices of the coronary arteries and brachiocephalic artery must be avoided. The aorta can be sutured over the graft to minimize bleeding. Complications with these prostheses include dislodgment or buckling, pressure gradients when the prostheses buckle or are too small, and erosion of the aortic wall. The authors have observed all of these complications, as have others.C8,D12 For these reasons, intraluminal prostheses have a limited role in treating acute ascending aortic dissection. Occasionally, end-to-end anastomosis of the ascending aorta is possible after resecting the area containing the aortic tear.O3

As repair of whatever type is being completed, suction on the intracardiac venting catheter is discontinued, and the venous line is partially occluded to fill the heart with blood and evacuate air. The lungs are temporarily inflated to assist in this maneuver. Anastomosis of the aortic graft to the distal ascending aorta is completed, and a venting catheter or needle is inserted through a small stab incision in the graft guarded by a pledgeted mattress suture. With suction on the vent, the aortic clamp is opened briefly to remove any remaining air and reapplied. Infusion of warm blood cardioplegia retrogradely through the coronary sinus or controlled aortic root reperfusion can be performed at this time (see "Methods of Myocardial Management during Cardiac Surgery" in Chapter 3). When this is completed, suction is placed on the aortic vent, and the aortic clamp is released and may be reapplied to the aortic graft distal to the vent in a partially occluding position. Standard de-airing procedures are carried out (see "De-airing the Heart" in Section III of Chapter 2). CPB is then discontinued. TEE can be used to assist in evacuating air from the cardiac chambers and to assess competency of the aortic valve or valve substitute.B24 Operation is completed in the usual manner.

#### *DeBakey Type I Dissection*

When it is known from preoperative diagnostic studies or intraoperative TEE that dissection involves the distal ascending aorta, aortic arch, and remainder of the thoracic aorta, provisions are made for hypothermic circulatory arrest. An open technique for performing the distal aortic anastomosis is recommended because it provides the opportunity for directly inspecting the aortic arch and proximal descending thoracic aorta and permits distal anastomosis of the aorta to the aortic graft to be made at the most appropriate level.

If retrograde brain perfusion is to be used (for alternative methods, see "Brain Protection during Operations on the Aortic Arch" under Special Situations and Controversies in Chapter 26), separate cannulae are placed in the superior and inferior venae cavae and are connected to venous return tubing of the pump-oxygenator. Tapes are placed around both venae cavae but are not secured. Cannulating the femoral artery and placing left-heart venting and retrograde cardioplegia catheters are performed as described earlier under "General Considerations."

Perfusate cooling is initiated, and nasopharyngeal temperature is reduced to less than 18°C to 20°C (see "Clinical Methodology of Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest and Its Alternatives" in Section IV of Chapter 2). If it is anticipated that circulatory arrest will exceed 15 to 20 minutes, the patient's head is packed in ice. The ascending aorta is clamped several centimeters proximal to the origin of the brachiocephalic artery. The aorta is opened proximal to the aortic clamp, the aortic root and aortic valve are examined, cardioplegic solution is infused, and the initial steps in managing the proximal extent of the dissection are carried out (see Fig. 25-7, *A-F*). When appropriate nasopharyngeal and bladder or rectal temperatures are reached, the operating table is placed in Trendelenburg position at a tilt of about 20 degrees.

The caval tapes are secured, and the superior vena caval cannula is briefly occluded so that distention of the upper venous system occurs. This eliminates the possibility of negative pressure in the vascular bed of the brain and avoids sucking air into it when the aorta is opened. No clamps or tourniquets are placed on the brachiocephalic vessels. The aortic clamp is removed, blood aspirated, and interiors of the aortic arch and proximal descending thoracic aorta examined for presence of intimal tears and evidence of aneurysmal dilatation or rupture. If the aortic arch contains no tears and is otherwise normal, the aorta is completely transected just proximal to the origin of the brachiocephalic artery. Using strips of PTFE felt or pericardium placed inside and outside the lumen, dissected layers of the aorta are approximated circumferentially with multiple 4-0 polypropylene mattress sutures (Fig. 25-8, *A*). Alternatively, using the technique described by Floten and colleagues, a cuff can be fashioned by folding the adventitial layer of the dissected aorta into the lumen over the intimal layer.F8 These three layers are approximated with interrupted 5-0 polypropylene mattress sutures. The resulting cuff with either technique is sutured to a prepared woven polyester graft with a continuous 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture (Fig. 25-8, *B*). As this suture line is being completed, cold oxygenated blood is infused retrogradely into the superior vena caval cannula to evacuate air from the brachiocephalic vessels (see "Brain Protection during Operations on the Aortic Arch" under Special Situations and Controversies in Chapter 26). Infusion is continued for 3 to 5 minutes at a flow of 300 to 500 mL · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , keeping central venous pressure below 35 mmHg.K14

The proximal end of the graft is elevated, and the undersurface of the aortic arch is gently massaged to assist in evacuating air (Fig. 25-8, *C*). The pump-oxygenator is briefly activated to assist in removing air that may have become entrapped in the descending thoracic aorta. A pledgeted purse-string suture of 3-0 polypropylene is placed in the aortic graft immediately adjacent to the suture line and a small incision made in the center. An aortic cannula attached to the arterial return tubing that has been disconnected from the cannula in the femoral artery is inserted through the purse-string suture, and flow is reestablished in the antegrade direction.

Alternatively, an aortic graft containing a 10-mm sidearm can be used; arterial return tubing is connected to the sidearm and secured. A soft-jawed clamp is placed on the aortic graft proximal to the cannula or sidearm graft, and rewarming is begun (Fig. 25-8, *D*). Establishing antegrade flow in the aorta following repair substantially reduces the possibility of

malperfusion of brachiocephalic vessels and may reduce flow in the false lumen, thus reducing the possibility of late aneurysmal changes in the remaining aorta.K14 The remaining steps in managing the proximal extent of the dissection and discontinuing CPB are completed as described earlier for DeBakey type II dissection. After removing the cannula in the aortic graft, the purse-string suture is secured (Fig. 25-8, *E*). If a sidearm graft was used for arterial return, it is sutureligated as close to the aortic graft as possible and the remaining portion excised.

If it is necessary to include the aortic arch in the repair, the incision already made in the ascending aorta is extended into the arch and, if necessary, into the upper descending thoracic aorta to just beyond the origin of the left subclavian artery (Fig. 25-9, *A*). If an intimal tear is present in the arch, is located beneath the origins of the brachiocephalic arteries, and does not involve them or extend into the descending thoracic aorta, the aorta is transected obliquely beneath the brachiocephalic arteries (Fig. 25-9, *B*). The area containing the tear is excised. Disrupted layers of aorta are approximated between strips of PTFE felt or pericardium using mattress sutures of 4-0 polypropylene as previously described (Fig. 25-9, *C*). A prepared polyester graft of appropriate size is cut obliquely with a wire cautery and is sutured to the aortic cuff with 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture (see Fig. 25-9, *C*). If the bevel created in the aorta at the level of transection is short, the graft is sutured so that it is vertically aligned with respect to the aortic arch (Fig. 25-9, *C-D*). If the aortic bevel is long, the graft is beveled in the reverse direction and sutured in a more horizontal position (see Fig. 25-9, *D,* inset).

As this anastomosis is being completed, cold oxygenated blood is infused into the superior vena cava as previously described, and air is evacuated from the brachiocephalic arteries and distal aorta. A cannula connected to the arterial return line of the pump-oxygenator is inserted into the graft close to the suture line and is secured with a purse-string suture. Alternatively, an aortic graft containing a sidearm can be used as previously described. Air is evacuated from the graft, the graft clamped proximal to the cannula (Fig. 25-9, *E*), and the procedure completed as previously described.

If the inner layer of the aorta is disrupted over the entire length of the aortic arch or if the arch has ruptured or is aneurysmal, replacing the entire arch is indicated.K11 After the aorta has been incised, the phrenic and vagus nerves are dissected free from the anterior surface of the arch. The aorta is transected distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. If dissection is present at this level, the disrupted layers of the aorta are approximated with strips of PTFE felt or pericardium. A prepared polyester graft is sutured to the distal aortic

**C,** Disrupted layers of aorta are approximated between strips of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) felt or pericardium and are secured with multiple polypropylene mattress sutures.

cuff with a 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture (Fig. 25-10, *A*). After this anastomosis is completed, the graft is temporarily clamped, and retrograde aortic perfusion is established briefly to detect leaks in the anastomotic suture line. These are repaired with mattress sutures of 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene. Alternatively, a ringed intraluminal prosthesis can be inserted into the true lumen of the descending thoracic aorta and secured with tapes, which are tied over a strip of PTFE felt.A4,D13,L3,L7

A full-thickness elliptical incision is made in the aorta surrounding the origins of the brachiocephalic arteries (see Fig. 25-10, *A*). If dissection is present, the layers of the aorta are approximated between strips of PTFE felt or pericardium. An opening is made in the aortic graft opposite the aortic cuff with a wire cautery, and the cuff is sutured to the graft with a continuous 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture (Fig. 25-10, *B*). As this suture line is being completed, cold oxygenated blood is infused retrogradely into the superior vena caval cannula to evacuate air from the brachiocephalic vessels. The open end of the graft is elevated to assist in evacuating air. A purse-string suture is placed in the graft beneath the brachiocephalic arteries, and an aortic cannula attached to the arterial return tubing is inserted into the graft through a small incision. Alternatively, as noted previously, an 8- or 10-mm polyester graft that is attached to the aortic graft and positioned beneath the anastomosis to the brachiocephalic arteries can be used for arterial return. A soft-jawed clamp is placed across the graft just proximal to the brachiocephalic artery. Antegrade flow is established and rewarming begun (Fig. 25-10, *C*). The remainder of the procedure is completed as described earlier.

If dissection extends into the brachiocephalic arteries and there are no intimal tears, disrupted layers of aorta adjacent to these arteries are approximated as described earlier and sutured to the aortic graft. If intimal tears are present in these arteries, they are transected, and the disrupted layers are

#### Repair of Acute DeBakey Type III (Type B) Dissection

## *General Considerations*

Preparations for repair of acute dissection originating in the descending thoracic aorta are the same as those for operations for acute aortic transection (see Technique of Operation in Chapter 24) and for aneurysms and other disorders involving the descending thoracic aorta (see "Preparations for Thoracic and Thoracoabdominal Aortic Surgery" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 26). Because spinal cord ischemic injury is a serious complication following descending thoracic aorta clamping, distal aortic perfusion is routinely employed (see "Methods for Perfusing the Distal Aorta during Aortic Clamping" under Special Situations and Controversies in Chapter 24). If only a short segment of the proximal descending thoracic aorta requires replacement, left atrial–to–femoral artery bypass or partial CPB can be used. If the distal aortic arch requires replacement, or if extensive resection of the descending thoracic or thoracoabdominal aorta is necessary, full CPB with profound hypothermia (with or without circulatory arrest) is preferred.

**Replacement of Descending Thoracic Aorta** After positioning the patient in the lateral decubitus position with the pelvis rotated posteriorly to allow access to the left femoral vessels, a posterolateral thoracotomy incision is made and the pleural cavity entered through the bed of the fifth rib, which can be retracted or resected. This incision provides adequate exposure of the distal aortic arch and proximal two thirds of the descending thoracic aorta. If exposure of the more distal thoracic aorta is required, the incision can be extended anteriorly, dividing the cartilage at the costal arch; alternatively, a separate incision through a lower interspace can be made using the same skin incision. After placing a retractor, the left lung is collapsed and retracted anteriorly. Often there is an extensive mediastinal hematoma, and the mediastinal pleura is incised only where clamps are to be placed (Fig. 25-11, *A;* see also Fig. 24-8, *A-D,* in Chapter 24). Distal aortic perfusion is then established.

Whenever possible, control of the proximal aorta should be obtained at a level proximal to the origin of the dissection, which is usually located just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. This is achieved by placing a clamp on the distal aortic arch between the left carotid and left subclavian arteries. The mediastinal pleura is opened in this area, and the aorta is circumferentially freed from surrounding tissue. The left subclavian artery is also freed from adjacent tissue near its origin. Intraoperative TEE and epiaortic scanning as well as preoperative CT or MRI can be used to detect presence of retrograde dissection in this area.

If placing clamps in these areas is inadvisable, total CPB with hypothermic circulatory arrest is used, and anastomosis of the aortic graft to the proximal aorta is performed using an open technique (see "Technique Using Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 26). The vagus nerve is identified and protected (see Fig. 25-11, *A*). The site for clamping the distal aorta is identified, the mediastinal pleura is incised in this area, and the aorta is freed from surrounding tissue. Every effort should be made to limit resection to as short a segment of the upper descending thoracic aorta as possible to minimize risk of spinal cord ischemic injury. Clamps are then placed on the aorta between the left carotid and left subclavian arteries, on the left subclavian artery, and on the descending aorta just distal to the proposed area of resection (see Fig. 25-11, *A*).

The aorta is opened longitudinally (Fig. 25-11, *B*), thrombus removed from the false lumen, and the true lumen entered. Orifices of any bronchial arteries and of the intercostal arteries above the level of the sixth intercostal space are suture-ligated. Intercostal arteries below this level should be preserved and can be temporarily occluded with bulldog clamps if necessary. The aorta is completely transected below the origin of the left subclavian artery. The recurrent laryngeal nerve should be identified and protected. The aortic cuff below the proximal aortic clamp is carefully examined. If no dissection is present, this cuff is sutured to a prepared polyester tube graft of appropriate size using a continuous 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture, incorporating a small cuff of PTFE felt that is placed on the external surface of the aorta (Fig. 25-11, *C*). If the layers of the aorta are separated in this area, they are approximated between strips of PTFE felt, and the resulting cuff is sutured to the aortic graft using the technique shown in Fig. 25-8, *A* and *B*. (If an intimal tear is present and extends proximally beyond the aortic clamp into the aortic arch, an alternative procedure is used as described in text that follows.) The completed suture line can be tested by placing a soft-jawed clamp on the graft and temporarily releasing the clamp on the proximal aorta. Bleeding sites on the suture line can be controlled with interrupted sutures.

The appropriate site for transection of the aorta above the distal clamp is selected. If this is above the level of the sixth intercostal space, the dissected layers are approximated between strips of PTFE felt using mattress sutures (Fig. 25-11, *D*). This cuff is sutured to the aortic graft with a continuous 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture. If the site of transection is below the sixth intercostal space, the aorta is divided obliquely whenever possible to preserve lower intercostal arteries, and the cuff containing the strip of PTFE felt is sutured to the aortic graft. If it is necessary to transect the

Clamps are placed on aorta between left carotid and left subclavian arteries, on left subclavian artery, and on the descending aorta just distal to proposed area of resection. Dashed line indicates site of incision. **B,** Aorta is opened and true and false lumens identified. Bulldog clamps are placed on exposed intercostal arteries.

**C,** Aorta is completely transected below origin of left subclavian artery. If layers of aorta are separated in this area, they are approximated between strips of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) felt or pericardium (see Fig. 25-8, *A* and *B*). Aortic cuff is sutured to a prepared polyester graft with a continuous polypropylene suture. **D,** Appropriate site for transection of distal aorta is selected. Dissected layers are approximated between strips of PTFE felt or pericardium, and aortic cuff is sutured to distal end of aortic graft. **E,** If aorta must be transected at or above level of left subclavian artery, the aortic graft is sutured to the aorta at this level, and transected subclavian artery is sutured to the aortic graft directly or to a prepared, interposed 8- or 10-mm polyester graft using a continuous polypropylene suture. **Figure 25-11, cont'd**

descending aorta below the level of the eighth or ninth intercostal space, intercostal arteries between the level of transection and the sixth intercostal space are isolated with a full-thickness cuff of aorta using the electrocautery, and this button of aorta is sutured to an opening in the graft with a continuous 4-0 polypropylene suture (see Fig. 26-18, *F* in Chapter 26). Alternatively, a separate prepared polyester graft can be sutured to the cuff of aorta surrounding the intercostal arteries. This graft is then sutured to an opening in the aortic graft with 5-0 polypropylene. If the aortic tissue surrounding the intercostal arteries is too friable to support sutures, these arteries are suture-ligated. Anastomosis of the graft to the distal aorta is completed as described previously.

If it is necessary to transect the aorta proximally at or above the level of the left subclavian artery, the aortic graft is sutured to the aorta at this level using the technique previously described, and the transected subclavian artery is sutured to the aortic graft directly or with an interposed prepared 8- or 10-mm polyester graft using 4-0 or 5-0 polypropylene suture (Fig. 25-11, *E*).

After the distal anastomosis is completed, the distal aortic clamp is removed and air evacuated from the graft using an 18-gauge needle. Proximal clamps are removed, and if no major bleeding points are identified, CPB is discontinued. Cannulae used for distal perfusion are removed, heparin is neutralized with protamine, and the femoral vessels are repaired with fine continuous sutures. The left atrial appendage, if cannulated, is suture-ligated at the base. Two or three drainage tubes are placed in the left pleural cavity, and the chest and groin incisions are closed in the standard manner.

**Involvement of Aortic Arch** Occasionally, a DeBakey type III dissection extends retrogradely, involving the aortic arch and even the ascending aorta. If arch involvement is recognized preoperatively or intraoperatively, hypothermic CPB and circulatory arrest are used (see "Technique Using Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest" in Chapter 26). During cooling, the left phrenic and vagus nerves are identified and protected. After the desired temperature has been reached, the patient is placed in the head-down position, a clamp is placed on the aorta near the site selected for the distal anastomosis, and circulation is arrested.

The aorta is opened anteriorly distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery, and the incision is extended proximally beneath the origins of the brachiocephalic arteries. The site for the anastomosis must be proximal to the site of any intimal tears or rupture, although separation of layers of the aorta may be present. The aorta is completely transected, divided layers of the aorta are approximated with strips of PTFE felt or pericardium, and a prepared aortic graft containing a 10-mm sidearm is sutured to this cuff as described previously. Most often, the aorta can be transected obliquely beneath the origins of the brachiocephalic arteries so that only a single anastomosis is required.

Rarely, separate anastomoses to the aorta proximal to the origins of the brachiocephalic arteries and to a cuff of aorta surrounding these arteries are necessary. Once these anastomoses are completed, the sidearm of the aortic graft is attached to a second arterial line from the pump-oxygenator. After evacuation of air, flow is established through the aortic graft as well as through the femoral arterial cannula to assist in evacuating air from the upper body. Once this has been accomplished, a clamp is placed on the graft just distal to the sidearm, and CPB is reestablished (see Fig. 26-19, *D-E* in Chapter 26). Anastomosis of the graft to the distal aorta is completed as described earlier under "Replacement of Descending Thoracic Aorta."

If dissection extends more proximally to involve the ascending aorta and the false lumen is not thrombosed or there is evidence for hemopericardium, the aorta should be approached through a midline sternotomy.K6 The technique is described earlier under "DeBakey Type I Dissection." The area of the aorta containing the intimal tear in the descending thoracic aorta may not be accessible with this anterior approach. In this situation, exposure of the proximal one third to one half of the descending thoracic aorta can be achieved by transverse extension of the midline sternotomy incision into the left third intercostal space, retracting the left lung anteriorly and inferiorly. If involvement of the ascending aorta with dissection is determined after a left thorocotomy has been performed, the thoractomy can be extended anteriorly, and the sternum divided transversely at this level to facilitate exposure.

**Involvement of Thoracoabdominal Aorta** Extension of operation to the thoracoabdominal aorta is indicated when rupture of this segment of the aorta has occurred or is imminent and when there is evidence for malperfusion of distal organs. This is only rarely necessary. Techniques for replacement of the thoracoabdominal aorta are discussed under "Thoracoabdominal Aorta Replacement" in Chapter 26.

# Repair of Intraoperative Aortic Dissection

Intraoperative dissection of the ascending aorta is an infrequent complication of cardiac operations that require use of CPB. In two large series of patients operated on between 1980 and 1990, intraoperative dissection recognized intraoperatively or early postoperatively occurred in about 0.5% of patients.G7,S20 It is also a recognized complication of off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), occurring in up to 1% of patients.B25,C3,T1 Actual prevalence is likely higher, because diagnosis is not made perioperatively in all patients, and because some patients present late after operation with evidence for dissection that likely occurred intraoperatively.C8,D12,T1 If unrecognized, this complication is associated with substantial mortality.G7 Prompt diagnosis and surgical treatment are essential for survival.

Intraoperative aortic dissection should be suspected when a subadventitial or intramural hematoma develops in the ascending aorta, particularly in association with excessive bleeding from suture lines or needle holes. TEE and epiaortic ultrasonographic imaging are especially useful in establishing presence and extent of the dissection. Dissection originates most commonly at sites of partial or complete aortic clamping and aortic cannulation, and less frequently at sites of proximal anastomoses to venous or arterial bypass grafts and of needle venting.G7,S20

Disrupted layers of aorta must be approximated and the false lumen, if present, obliterated. If dissection is localized to a small part of the aorta, such as the site of a venting or cardioplegia needle, it can be repaired by plicating the aorta using mattress sutures placed over strips of PTFE felt to exclude the area of dissection. This type of repair should be performed at a low level of aortic pressure to avoid tension on the suture line and possible extension of the dissection. This is best accomplished with the patient on CPB. Clamping the aorta with a partially occluding clamp surrounding the area of the tear should be avoided.

If the tear occurs at the anastomotic site of a bypass graft, the graft should be relocated to another area of the aorta or anastomosed to an adjacent graft. After the aorta is clamped in a nondissected area, divided layers of the aorta are approximated, usually with strips of PTFE felt or pericardium placed inside and outside the aorta. If dissection is not circumferential, the defect can be repaired with a patch of polyester or pericardium. If dissection is more extensive or extends beyond the ascending aorta, as is often the case when it originates from the aortic clamp or aortic cannulation site, resection and graft replacement of the ascending aorta are usually required. When dissection originates at the aortic cannulation site, the cannula is removed, and a common femoral artery exposed and cannulated. Unless dissection is confined to the proximal two thirds of the ascending aorta, aortic clamping should be avoided and preparations made for hypothermic circulatory arrest. Repair is accomplished using the techniques described earlier under "Repair of Acute DeBakey Type I or II (Type A) Dissection."

## SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Early postoperatively, standard protocols are used (see Chapter 5). Control of hypertension is particularly important because hypertension predisposes the patient to excessive bleeding and early redissection or rupture of the residual false lumen. Because malperfusion of major branches of the aorta may occur or become apparent postoperatively (see Special Situations and Controversies later), peripheral pulses and organ function should be monitored frequently.

Periodic evaluation following surgical repair or medical management of acute aortic dissection is mandatory. Stringent control of arterial hypertension is essential and is accomplished with calcium channel blocking agents, βadrenergic blocking agents, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors used singly or in combination. β-Adrenergic blocking agents reduce rate of dilatation of the aorta and development of aortic complications in patients with Marfan syndrome and thus may provide an additional protective effect in patients with acute aortic dissection.S14

Long-term follow-up is also necessary to detect false lumen enlargement and development of aneurysms that may require surgical treatment to prevent rupture. Currently, contrast-enhanced CT is the most widely used and costeffective diagnostic study for evaluating the dissected aorta postoperatively. It provides accurate measurement of aortic diameter at various levels. MRI provides similar information, but is presently less readily available and more expensive than CT. Aortography may be indicated if additional surgery is contemplated or if compromise of branch vessels is suspected. TTE may be used to assess competency of the aortic valve after its resuspension as well as the size of the ascending aorta. TEE provides this information as well as information regarding flow and thrombosis in the false lumen. A protocol proposed by Borst and colleagues for follow-up of patients with aortic dissection is shown in Table 25-1. B18 Patients with Marfan syndrome should be examined at 6- to 12-month intervals for the duration of their lives. Follow-up examinations are best performed by cardiovascular specialists who are

# RESULTS

Acute Dissection Involving Ascending Aorta (DeBakey Types I and II)

## *Early (Hospital) Death*

Hospital mortality for heterogeneous groups of patients undergoing repair for various types of acute dissection of the ascending aorta has been 5% to 33%.B5,B11,B12,C7,C8,F5,G1,G4,G5,G11,M14,N2,O4,T4,Y4,Y7,Z1 A report by IRAD, established in 1996 and consisting of 18 large international referral centers, assessed the current presentation, management, and outcomes of patients with acute aortic dissection; hospital mortality was 25% among 526 patients (CL 23%-27%) with acute type A aortic dissection treated surgically between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2001.T4

## *Time-Related Survival*

In the study of Crawford and colleagues of a heterogeneous group of patients undergoing repair of acute ascending aortic dissection, 1-month, and 1-, 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival was 79%, 66%, 46%, 46%, and 37%, respectively (Fig. 25-12, *A*).C7 The hazard function for death had a rapidly declining early phase and a constant phase (see Fig. 25-12, *B*). Among 174 patients treated by the Stanford group and followed up to 30 years, 1-, 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival was 67%, 55%, 37%, and 24%, respectively.F5

#### *Modes of Death*

In earlier years, hemorrhage and acute cardiac failure were the principal modes of death early after operation. In more recent experience, which reflects improved perioperative management, brain injury and malperfusion syndromes have emerged as important contributors to early death.B11,G1,G5,G11 Cardiac failure, MI, and stroke are other common modes of early death.Y7 Approximately 20% to 30% of late deaths are related to aortic rupture or new dissection.C8,F5,Y7

#### *Incremental Risk Factors for Premature Death*

**Acuity** The event of acute dissection itself is the dominant patient-specific risk factor, as is need for preoperative resuscitation.C7,G5 Predissection functional class (New York Heart Association class) of the patient was a surprisingly weak risk factor, which interacts with extent of operation to become more powerful when the arch is included in repair (Fig. 25-13).C7 However, Sabik and colleagues, who combined acute and chronic dissections and used both analysis of interactions with dissection acuity and propensity score adjustment (see "Clinical Studies with Nonrandomly Assigned Treatment" in Section I of Chapter 6), concluded that it was hemodynamic state rather than acuity of dissection that was the risk factor for early mortality.S1 In the IRAD study, preoperative shock or cardiac tamponade was an independent predictor of operative mortality.T4

**Location of Dissection** Five-year survival is appreciably better for patients with DeBakey type II as compared with DeBakey type I ascending aortic dissection (87% vs. 56%, respectively).G4

**Comorbidity** In the IRAD study, age 70 years or older was a risk factor for hospital mortality.T4 Older age was a risk

factor for late-phase risk in the studies by Sabik and colleagues and Zierer and colleagues.S1,Z1 In the IRAD study, previous aortic valve replacement and preoperative limb ischemia were risk factors for premature death.T4 Presence of diabetes is a risk factor,C7,G5 as is preoperative renal insufficiency.S1

**Procedural Risk Factors** Earlier date of operation is a predictor of early death in some series (Fig. 25-14), reflecting the major improvements in technique and perioperative managementC7,F5,S1 not seen in other series.N2,O4 Failure to include the area of the intimal tear has not been, with any certainty, a risk factor for death early or late after repair.C7,M9,S1 Inclusion of the arch in the repair is a risk factor for death within 30 days and late after operation in some series (see Fig. 25-14) but not in others.B2,C7,G9,H3,K6,L4,O1,S1,S23,Y8 Sabik and colleagues found that need to use a composite graft technique was a risk factor.S1

Concomitant CABG, particularly when performed in conjunction with extended operations, was a risk factor for death in the experience of Crawford and colleagues and

**Postoperative Risk Factors** Development of postoperative cardiac dysfunction and neurologic complications, as well as need for hemodialysis in the postoperative period, are risk factors for early death.C8,G5,N2

#### *False Lumen after Repair*

Numerous follow-up studies of patients undergoing repair of acute ascending aortic dissection have demonstrated that the false lumen remains patent in approximately 70% to 80%.G14,M12,P2,T6,Y2 Thus, operative intervention is usually not curative unless dissection involves only the portion of the aorta that is resected. Complete resection is possible in dissections limited to the ascending aorta (DeBakey type II) and those involving the aortic arch and proximal descending thoracic aorta. Among operative survivors, aneurysmal dilatation of the remaining dissected aorta occurs in up to 50% to 60% within 10 years, and up to 25% require reoperation (see later section on "Reoperation").P2,Y5,Z2 Risk factors for aneurysmal dilatation include patent or wide false lumen, larger aortic diameter early after repair, Marfan syndrome, hypertension, younger age, and male sex.P2,Y5,Z2 In the study of Park and colleagues, shrinkage of the false lumen occurred in 36 (29%) of 122 patients with serial CT imaging who were followed a mean of 34 months. Shrinkage occurred in 23 of 24 patients (96%) who had thrombosed and narrow false lumens in the thoracic aorta.P2

## *Redissection*

Redissection (i.e., new aortic dissection in a different part of the aortic wall) may develop years after surgical or medical treatment of an acute aortic dissection. Marfan syndrome is believed to increase the probability of redissection.

# *Aortic Valve Competence after Commissural Resuspension*

Successful resuspension of the aortic valve, rather than replacement, does not increase risk of operation in patients with acute aortic dissection and aortic regurgitation.F2,M7,M10 Furthermore, in most patients, the aortic valve is competent or shows only mild regurgitation after this procedure. Late reoperation and valve replacement occur infrequently.L2 Meng and colleaguesM7 reported 55 of 60 patients (92%; CL 86%-95%) in a collected series to be free of the need for valve replacement 2 to 10 years later, virtually the same as that reported by Borst and colleagues, Fann and colleagues, Jex and colleagues, and Sabik and colleagues.B19,F2,J2,S1 Among 123 patients with acute type A dissection treated at Stanford University who had resuspension of the aortic valve (*n* = 82), composite graft replacement (*n* = 21), or separate valve and ascending aortic replacement (*n* = 20), actuarial freedom estimates for reoperation on the aortic valve at 6 years were 94% ± 4%, 100% ± 2%, and 88% ± 12%, respectively (*P* = NS).L2 A new dissection proximal to the ascending aortic graft or development of a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm late postoperatively predisposes patients to developing important aortic valve regurgitation that may require reoperation.

#### *Reoperation*

Need for reoperation is relatively common. It is required most often for enlarging aneurysms of the false lumen but also for a new dissection, false aneurysms at the original suture lines, sinus of Valsalva aneurysms, or aortic valve regurgitation (described in the preceding text). In the experience from Stanford with 174 patients with acute type A dissections, 30 patients (17%; CL 14%-20%) required reoperation.F5 Freedom from reoperation at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years was 94%, 83%, 65%, and 65%, respectively. In the multivariable analysis, younger age was the only risk factor predicting a higher likelihood of reoperation over time. Similar prevalence of reoperation has been observed by other groups.B3,C7,H4,K12,Y5,Z2 However, Sabik and colleagues reported 5- and 10-year freedom from reoperation of 91% and 85%, with a rate of 2% per year after the first 3 months.S1 Freedom from reoperation for distal false-lumen aneurysm only, in the series of Crawford and colleagues, is shown in Fig. 25-15. C7 Kirsch and colleagues identified severe

**Figure 25-15** Actuarially estimated freedom from reoperation for distal false-lumen aneurysm after repair of acute aortic dissection involving ascending aorta. (From Crawford and colleagues.C7)

preoperative aortic regurgitation as the only risk factor for proximal reoperation.K12 Reoperation is required with greater frequency in patients with Marfan syndrome.B3,K16 Other important risk factors for reoperation include patent false lumen, large initial aortic diameter distal to the repair, hypertension, and non-resection of the primary tear.I1,K12,Y5,Z2

## Surgical Techniques to Reduce the Frequency of Late Aneurysm Formation and Reoperation

## *Total Aortic Arch Replacement*

Total aortic arch replacement at the time of repair of acute DeBakey type I (type A) aortic dissection has been performed in experienced surgical centers and has been accomplished without increasing the risk of operation in selected patients.A6,B2,K6,M3 It has been proposed as a mechanism to promote thrombosis of the distal false lumen and reduce the frequency of late aneurysm formation and reoperation.T2 Extended follow-up, however, has not conclusively demonstrated that this procedure improves survival or reduces frequency of reoperation.B9,K8,K12

## *Elephant Trunk Technique*

Addition of an elephant trunk to ascending aorta and total arch replacement has been proposed as a method to ensure a more secure distal aortic anastomosis and to promote thrombosis of the false lumen in the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta.A7,K2,K5 This can be accomplished with either a polyester graft (see section on Elephant Trunk Technique in Chapter 26) or an endovascular stent-graft inserted through the open aortic arch (Fig. 25-16). The putative advantages of an elephant trunk include promoting thrombosis of the false lumen, reducing the frequency of subsequent operations for aneurysm formation of the residual dissected aorta, and simplifying any subsequent operative procedure on the distal aorta. In contrast to a polyester elephant trunk, use of a stent-graft permits fixation of the distal end of the elephant trunk to the aortic wall. Thrombosis of the false lumen surrounding the elephant trunk has been demonstrated in a high percentage of patients undergoing either technique (Fig. 25-17). Thrombosis of the more distal thoracic and abdominal aorta, however, has not consistently occurred.U1,U2 It has not been conclusively

demonstrated that the frequency of reoperations on the remaining dissected aorta has been reduced.P8 Unique complications of extending the aortic graft into the descending thoracic aorta include paraplegia/paraparesis, creation of a new dissection by the stents of the endovascular graft, endoleak, and compression or collapse of the graft, creating important obstruction to aortic flow.D10,E1,F9,S13,W2

#### *Functional Status*

Most patients return to their predissection functional status after surgical repair of the acute dissection.

## Acute Dissection Involving Descending Thoracic Aorta

# *Early (Hospital) Death*

When operation is performed as a routine for acute dissections involving the descending aorta, early mortality can be as low as 10%.M9 However, in most centers, operation is commonly performed in patients with specific indications (see Indications for Operation later) such as a failed initial course of medical treatment, and for them, early mortality has ranged from 28% to 49%.B22,C8,F5,G3,H1,M9,S23,T3 In an IRAD study, independent predictors of early death following surgical treatment in 82 patients were age older than 70 years (odds ratio 4.3; CL 2.4-7.9) and preoperative shock/ hypotension (odds ratio 6.0; CL 2.6-14.0).T3

# *Time-Related Survival*

Time-related survival following operation appears to be similar to that of patients with acute dissection involving the ascending aorta.F5,M4,S23 In the Stanford University experience, 1-, 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival for 46 patients with acute type B dissections was 56%, 48%, 29%, and 11%, respectively.F5 In a more recent IRAD study of patients treated surgically and discharged alive, 3-year survival was 83% ± 19%.T5

#### *Morbidity*

Paralysis of the lower extremities and renal failure are more frequent postoperative complications following operations on the descending aorta than on the ascending aorta.

## INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

## Acute Dissection Involving Ascending Aorta (DeBakey Types I and II)

When dissection involves the ascending aorta with or without involvement of the proximal portion of the aortic arch, immediate operation is indicated. This policy is the result of comparison of the natural history (see Fig. 25-6) with results of surgical treatment (see Figs. 25-12 and 25-18) and the knowledge that rupture or fatal cardiac tamponade is likely to occur.H1 Contraindications are markedly advanced age and frailty, severe incurable disease such as malignancy or chronic dementia, and evidence of irreversible brain injury. Stroke occurring as a result of dissection is a risk factor for death after operation, but among survivors, symptoms and signs of stroke may resolve considerably. Thus, a new stroke is not necessarily a contraindication to operation.F3 MI induced by the dissection, coma, paraplegia, renal failure, and ischemia of the extremities and abdominal viscera are

![](_page_24_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 25-18** Thirty-day mortality by type of dissection and management. Key: *A,* Type A dissection; *B,* type B dissection. (From Hagan and colleagues.H1)

not contraindications to operation. These complications may disappear or improve following repair of the aorta, or they may be surgically treated at the time of or after the aortic procedure.

The aortic arch should be included in repair when the intimal tear is located in the arch, the inner layer of the aorta is fragmented, the outer wall of the aorta is tenuous or aneurysmal, or rupture of the arch has occurred.K11 Although replacement of all or, more commonly, a part of the arch to eliminate the site of the intimal tear is arguable, it should usually be performed, because prevalence of late reoperation is greater when the site of the intimal tear is not resected, and because recent experience with resection of the aortic arch in the setting of acute dissection is associated with acceptable operative risk.A6,C7,G11,H3,K5,K6,K8,L4,U2,W2 Replacement of the arch may also be advisable in patients with acute ascending aortic dissection when the tear is located in the proximal descending thoracic aorta.K6,K8

# Acute Dissection Involving Descending Thoracic Aorta (DeBakey Type III)

Whereas indications for operation for acute aortic dissections involving the ascending aorta are fairly well standardized, those for acute dissections involving the descending aorta are not. When only the descending thoracic aorta is involved in acute dissection, with or without involvement of the abdominal aorta and iliac vessels, and there have been no clinically evident complications of the acute dissection, medical treatment is indicated. This plan is supported by comparisons of results in comparable patients treated medically vs. surgically, which show no differences.G3 With medical treatment only, approximately 90% of selected patients survive for 30 days (Fig. 25-18) and 80% survive at least 1 year after acute dissection.D9,H1,W4 Medical treatment is directed toward maintaining normal (not elevated) arterial blood pressure with sodium nitroprusside, reducing force of left ventricular ejection with β-adrenergic receptor blockade, and maintaining good urine flow and good overall subsystem function.D9,M6,W4 When initial medical treatment results in survival without important complications, close patient follow-up after hospital discharge is essential. This need is emphasized by the experience of Wheat and colleagues and of McFarland and colleagues, who found that 50% of such patients die during the subsequent 3 to 5 years.M6,W4 Follow-up is conducted to obtain the same information, and for the same reasons as required after surgical treatment (see Special Features of Postoperative Care earlier in this chapter).

Complications occurring in patients with acute aortic dissection involving only the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta require immediate surgical treatment by open operation, endovascular grafting, or interventional procedures to manage malperfusion (see "Malperfusion" and "Endovascular Grafts" later under Special Situations and Controversies). These include aortic rupture; dissection superimposed upon a preexisting aneurysm; rapid expansion of aortic diameter; ischemia of limbs, visceral organs, or kidneys; progression of dissection; uncontrolled hypertension; intractable pain despite medical therapy; and extensive hemothorax. Marfan syndrome is considered by some to be an indication for early operation because of poorer results with medical therapy.

Paraplegia occurring as an isolated complication is not an indication for intervention, because recovery of spinal cord function following repair of aortic dissection does not commonly occur. However, neither is it a contraindication to operation, because relief of distal ischemia, particularly when femoral pulses are absent, may result in return of sensory and motor function. Although there are no absolute contraindications to operative treatment, mortality may be prohibitively high in very elderly patients and those with comorbid conditions such as ischemic heart disease, pulmonary disease, and extensive arteriosclerosis.

# SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

## Malperfusion Syndromes

Major branches of the aorta are commonly involved in dissection, and the presenting clinical picture may be influenced by symptoms that result from ischemia of one or more affected organs. Thus, patients may present with myocardial ischemia, stroke, paralysis of the lower extremities, symptoms and signs of acute abdomen, renal failure, or ischemia of the extremities. In the large autopsy study of Hirst and colleagues, dissection was observed in the carotid arteries in 28%; in the celiac, mesenteric, or renal arteries in 28%; in the iliac and femoral arteries in 26%; in the subclavian arteries in 14%; in the coronary arteries in 7%; and in the spinal arteries in 1.8% of cases.H5

In large clinical studies of aortic dissection, symptomatic malperfusion of the major aortic branches was present in 15% to 33% of patients.B17,C1,F4,O2 Malperfusion and ischemia can result from compression of the true lumen of the aorta by the expanding false lumen, extension of the dissection into the branch artery with compression of the true lumen, intussusception of the inner wall of the aorta into a branch artery, or occlusion of a branch vessel by a flap of dissected aorta. Managing malperfusion of the coronary arteries during repair of acute dissection involving the ascending aorta was discussed earlier under "Repair of Disrupted but Nonectatic Aortic Root." If malperfusion of the brachiocephalic arteries is detected after establishing CPB using the femoral artery or after placing a clamp on the ascending aorta, urgently establishing antegrade flow in the ascending aorta is indicated. This can be accomplished by direct cannulation of the ascending aorta or aortic arch guided by TEE, or by cannulating the left ventricular apex or right axillary artery.B20,R10,S2

Occasionally, extraanatomic bypass grafts to the carotid or subclavian arteries may be necessary to correct persisting malperfusion after repair of ascending aortic dissection. In most cases of acute ascending aortic dissection, graft replacement of the ascending aorta will correct malperfusion syndromes of visceral, renal, and lower extremity arteries, and this should be expeditiously performed.F4,G2 If ischemia persists, fenestration of the dissecting membrane or direct revascularization of the occluded arteries may be necessary.G2 In patients with acute descending aortic dissection, fenestration or direct revascularization procedures may be indicated to relieve ischemia when other indications to resect and replace a segment of the descending thoracic aorta are not present.E6 Alternatively, these procedures can be performed using endovascular techniques.C2,F6,L1,P5,W1

# Endovascular Grafts

Endovascular grafts have been used to treat acute complicated DeBakey type I (type A) and DeBakey type III (type B) aortic dissections when the primary intimal tear is located in the descending thoracic aorta.D2,K3,K4,P1 Use of an endovascular stent-graft eliminates need for thoracotomy and for clamping the thoracic aorta. Other putative advantages of endovascular repair include restoration of true lumen flow with closure of the primary tear, thrombosis of the false lumen, restoration of flow to distal organs and lower extremities, and lower early mortality than reported for open repair. Results of endografting from recently reported series and from a single meta-analysis are shown in Table 25-2. Early mortality appears to be lower than for open repair, although no randomized trials comparing the two forms of therapy for complicated descending thoracic aortic dissection have been reported. Conversion to open operation has been infrequent (0.6% among the 942 patients [CL 0.4%-1.0%] included in the meta-analysis of Parker and GolledgeP3).

The complications of aortic rupture, stroke, spinal cord ischemic injury (paralysis or paraparesis), and renal failure have not been eliminated, and adjunctive procedures to manage endoleaks and persisting malperfusion are often required (see Table 25-2). Type A aortic dissection following endovascular repair occurred in 2% of patients (18 of 918; CL 1.5%-2.6%) in the meta-analysis of Parker and Golledge.P3 Complete thrombosis of the false lumen has not been consistently observed.C6,F7,K10,S24

A randomized multicenter trial comparing endovascular stent-grafting with medical therapy for patients with uncomplicated acute type B aortic dissection who were randomized 2 weeks after onset of symptoms was performed by the INvestigation of STEnt-grafts in Aortic Dissection (INSTEAD) group.N6 There was no difference in 30-day mortality between the two groups. One-year survival was 91% in the stent-graft group and 97% in the medically treated group (*P* = .16).C6 Follow-up from one of the earliest series of patients with acute type B dissection treated with endovascular stent-grafts by Palma and colleaguesP1 demonstrated that at a mean of 36 ± 28 months, late mortality was 18%; subsequent endovascular grafting was required in 6 of 28 patients (21%); and late failure, defined as sudden or aortic-related death, surgical conversion, or reintervention, occurred in 12 patients (43%).A3

## Detecting and Managing Coexisting Coronary Artery Disease

With increased use of CT and TEE to diagnose acute ascending aortic dissection, routinely performing preoperative angiography, including coronary angiography, has been questioned.G1,K9,R3 Rizzo and colleagues suggest that rapid noninvasive diagnosis and avoidance of routine angiography appear to improve survival by expediting surgical intervention and thus decreasing risk of aortic rupture.R3 In contrast, Creswell and colleagues documented the presence of arteriosclerotic coronary artery disease (>50% stenosis) in 8 of 23 patients (35%; CL 25%-45%) with acute ascending aortic

dissection.C9 Four of these patients with the most severe disease had CABG at the time of repair of acute dissection, and all survived the operative procedure. Mean age of the four patients was 73 years, whereas age of the entire cohort of patients with acute dissection was 59 years. These observations suggest that coronary angiography and CABG, when indicated, should be considered for hemodynamically stable patients with a known history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG, or acute changes on preoperative ECGs.

## Use of Biological Glues to Reduce Bleeding and Obliterate the False Lumen

GRF and other biological glues have been used in an attempt to reduce bleeding during operations for acute aortic dissection. Although several groups have reported satisfactory early outcomes with use of GRF and other glues with low mortality and reduced bleeding, no prospective or randomized trials have been reported.B1,B2,B10,F1,P4 In contrast to the findings of Bachet and colleagues, Goossens and colleagues did not observe a reduction in hospital mortality or need for reoperation for bleeding following introduction of GRF glue.B1,G5 In studies from centers in which GRF glue has not been used, comparably low mortality and occurrence of bleeding have been reported.B11,B12,C8,G1,Y4 Biological glues have also been used to facilitate reconstruction of the aortic root by obliterating the false lumen and reinforcing the aortic layers.B1,K7 Although initial results have been satisfactory, need for reoperation for aortic root dissection and for aortic regurgitation attributed to use of various glues has been observed in several centers.B15,F11,K7
