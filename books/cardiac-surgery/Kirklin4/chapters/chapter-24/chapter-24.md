#### DEFINITION

Acute traumatic aortic disruption is rupture of all or part of the aortic wall, usually occurring as a result of blunt trauma. A theoretical sequence of injury involves initial rupture of the intimal and medial layers. After a period of unpredictable duration, rupture of the adventitial layer occurs.N1,P1 Patients are considered to have acute disruption when it occurs within 14 days of injury. Chronic traumatic aortic disruptions and posttraumatic aneurysms (pseudoaneurysms) are discussed in Chapter 26.

Paraplegia as a complication of aortic surgery, and grafts used to replace or exclude the aorta, are also discussed in this chapter.

#### HISTORICAL NOTE

Although the lethal nature of acute traumatic aortic disruption had been recognized for centuries and was noted by Strassmann in 1947,S8 data supporting lethality of traumatic disruption and temporal relationships between trauma and subsequent death were delineated by Parmley and colleagues in 1958.P1 The first report of successful repair of traumatic disruption of the thoracic aorta apparently was by Dshanelidze in 1923 (cited by Clarke and colleaguesC6). In 1957, Gerbode and colleagues reported successful repair of such an injury,G4 as did Klassen and colleagues in 1958 (according to Passaro and PaceP2 and Vasko and colleaguesV1). In 1998, Kato and colleagues at Stanford University reported successful treatment of three patients with acute traumatic aortic disruption using endovascular stent-grafts constructed from modified Z stents covered with woven polyester or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft material and deployed through a delivery sheath from a peripheral artery.K3

### MORPHOLOGY

#### Upper Descending Thoracic Aorta

Traumatic aortic disruptions occur most commonly in the upper descending thoracic aorta at or near the aortic isthmus. In the study of Parmley and colleagues, 45% of disruptions occurred at this site.P1 In a more recent multicenter study by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) reported by Demetriades and colleagues, 82 (74%) of 110 acute aortic injuries occurred in this location.D5 Occasionally, the disruption may occur at the origin of the left subclavian artery and extend proximally to involve the distal portion of the aortic arch.

A traditional view has been that with abrupt deceleration of the thorax, such as occurs in a high-speed vehicular accident in which the body is thrown against a near-stationary object, the ligamentum arteriosum and intercostal arteries anchor the upper descending thoracic aorta to the thorax, as do the thoracic exits of the brachiocephalic vessels. These structures decelerate with the thorax, but the distal end of the aortic arch and most proximal part of the descending thoracic aorta continue to move forward. Aortic disruption tends to develop at the interface between these two areas, although the sum of the forces involved and directions of their effects are complex. The force needed to produce rupture is equivalent to an intravascular pressure of 2500 mmHg.Z1

There are other theories regarding the mechanism of blunt aortic injuryN1 (Fig. 24-1). Aortic rupture from a sudden increase in intraabdominal pressure may explain the association between blunt aortic injury and diaphragmatic rupture.R5 A "water-hammer" effect, which involves simultaneous occlusion of the aorta and a sudden elevation in blood pressure, and the "osseous pinch" effect from entrapment of the aorta between the anterior chest wall and the vertebral column have also been postulated.C7,R3 Most injuries probably involve a combination of forces.

Disruption can be complete, including aortic adventitia and mediastinal pleura. If the deceleration forces are less severe, the mediastinal pleura and the adventitia are spared. With lower initial velocity or less rapid deceleration, the mediastinal pleura and adventitia remain intact, while a fracture develops in a portion of the circumference of the aorta, usually posteriorly.

If the person survives the immediate post-disruption period, the periaortic hematoma begins to liquefy about 2 weeks after the traumatic event. It is gradually absorbed or evacuated into the aorta, and a false aneurysm (pseudoaneurysm) develops. The false aneurysm may remain stable for a long period and even calcify, but it can enlarge and rupture.

#### Ascending Aorta

Disruption of the ascending aorta is uncommon (10% of isolated cases of disruption without other major visceral injuries reported by Parmley and colleaguesP1 and 3.6% [4 of 111 patients] reported by Demetriades and colleaguesD5). Again, the mechanism is sudden deceleration, which is apt to be severe in unrestrained drivers who strike the steering wheel.A7 Cammack and colleagues showed that vertical forces of deceleration tend to lead to rupture of the ascending aorta and arch, and horizontal forces to rupture of the descending aorta.C2 Disruption occurs most commonly in the distal portion of the ascending aorta, near the origin of the brachiocephalic trunk. Less commonly, it is in the proximal portion of the ascending aorta. As in the upper descending thoracic aorta, disruption may be complete or partial.

#### Other Sites

Disruptions can occur in the lower thoracic aorta (often in association with spinal fractures) and in the aortic arch and abdominal aorta.A7,K8,P1,R1

#### CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

#### Pathophysiology

When complete disruption occurs that includes the investing mediastinal pleura or pericardium, hemorrhage is free and exsanguinating, and death occurs instantly or within a few minutes. When the tear involves all layers of the aortic wall but the mediastinal pleura remains intact, a large amount of blood escapes into the retropleural tissues, and signs and symptoms of hemorrhagic shock appear. Usually under such circumstances, some blood or plasma passes through the mediastinal pleura to produce a left hemothorax or pleural fluid collection. When the adventitia of the aorta remains essentially intact, a smaller extravasation of blood occurs, and the mediastinal hematoma is less extensive. The aortic

**Figure 24-1** Theories of blunt aortic injury. Many blunt aortic injuries probably involve a combination of forces, including stretching, shearing, torsion, a "water-hammer effect" (which involves simultaneous occlusion of the aorta and a sudden elevation in blood pressure), and the "osseous pinch" effect from entrapment of the aorta between the anterior chest wall and vertebral column. (From Neschis and colleagues.N1)

adventitia is more likely to remain intact when the tear does not involve the entire circumference of the aortic wall.

#### Clinical Features

Persons with acute traumatic aortic disruptions frequently have other severe injuries, including liver and spleen lacerations with intraabdominal hemorrhage, and head injuries. Such injuries have their own clinical features and diagnostic criteria that may affect management of the aortic disruption (see Indications for Operation later in this chapter).

Those who survive to reach the hospital may be in profound hemorrhagic shock if a large mediastinal extravasation has occurred or if there has been extensive intraabdominal or extremity bleeding. Some patients, however, are hemodynamically stable after initial resuscitative measures, and a few show no signs of hemodynamic instability. In such patients, upper body hypertension is common.R2 Some patients in whom other trauma is not severe complain of interscapular back pain, but pain is generally not a major part of the presentation.

Evidence of impaired blood flow beyond the disruption is uncommon. However, a small number of patients with acute disruption of the descending thoracic aorta who reach the hospital alive have paraplegia or paraparesis (2.6%; CL 2.2%- 3.0%, of the 1742 patients in the meta-analysis of von Oppell and colleaguesV5). Rarely, patients have severe lower body and leg ischemia.

#### Diagnostic Imaging

#### *Chest Radiography*

The chest radiograph is usually abnormal, but with variable findings. There may be opacification of the left hemothorax and rightward shift of the mediastinum resulting from massive collection of fluid in the left pleural space. These features are not diagnostic of aortic disruption, because bleeding after trauma may come from intercostal or pulmonary vessels, cardiac and pericardial rupture, or traumatic rupture of the left hemidiaphragm with intrathoracic splenic rupture.

Commonly the radiograph shows only diffuse upper mediastinal widening (Fig. 24-2), which in the setting of a severe injury strongly suggests upper descending aortic disruption. However, rightward shift of the trachea, blurring of the normally sharp outline of the upper descending thoracic aorta, and opacification of the usually clear space between it and the pulmonary trunk may be evident; all these findings suggest aortic disruption.M5

#### *Computed Tomography*

Computed tomography (CT) has been evaluated as a screening examination to detect aortic injury in patients with blunt chest trauma.M7 In the early years of its use, time required to perform the study (60-70 minutes) in patients who often were severely injured, low sensitivity and positive predictive value, and lack of demonstrated cost effectiveness limited its utility.D10 It is, however, essential for managing patients with associated head trauma and for assessing presence of intraabdominal and retroperitoneal injuries.

Now, helical CT of the thorax can be performed more rapidly than conventional CT, and its sensitivity for detecting blunt aortic injury equals that of aortography (discussed later).F1 In trauma centers, it is currently the most widely used technique to diagnose traumatic aortic disruption.D4 Findings indicative of aortic disruption include extravasation of contrast, intimal flaps, mural thrombus, paraaortic hematoma, wall thickening, pseudoaneurysm, and pseudocoarctationG3 (Fig. 24-3). Advantages of helical CT over other imaging techniques include its wide availability, speed of performance, sensitivity, and relatively low cost.

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a highly effective method for imaging the proximal ascending aorta, distal aortic arch, and descending thoracic aorta.T1 Its characteristic finding is presence of a mobile mural flap (Fig. 24-4). Two studies comparing TEE with aortography or with findings at operation or autopsy in 101 and 32 patients, respectively, have demonstrated a sensitivity of 91% and 100% and a specificity of 100% and 98%, respectively.S5,V4 A more recent prospective comparison of TEE to helical CT demonstrated a sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of 93%, 100%, 99%, and 100%, respectively, for TEE, compared with 73%, 100%, 95%, and 100% for helical CT.V3 TEE can be performed with minimal risk in the emergency room, intensive care unit, or operating room and can be carried out simultaneously with other diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.G2,L9 It requires less than 30 minutes to complete and provides, in addition to images of the aorta, information about ventricular function and wall motion. It can detect presence of cardiac valvar lesions and pericardial fluid. A limitation is that the distal ascending aorta and brachiocephalic trunk cannot be imaged clearly because of interposition of the column of air in the distal trachea and right bronchus between the probe in the esophagus and the aorta. Thus, presence of a tear in these locations cannot be excluded. In centers with extensive experience, TEE can be used as the primary diagnostic imaging technique in patients with blunt chest trauma.

#### *Aortography*

Until recently, aortography has been the definitive diagnostic study for acute aortic disruption (Fig. 24-5), the imaging modality against which all subsequently developed imaging techniques have been compared. Its specificity approaches 100%, and prevalence of false positives and false negatives is low.D10,P4,S5 The procedure is associated with some risk, is time consuming, and requires a skilled interventional radiology team.D10 Up to 90% of studies performed to determine presence of aortic disruption are negative.P3,S5

The aortic disruption *(small arrow)*, periaortic hematoma *(asterisk)*, and a large pleural effusion *(large arrow)* are shown. (From Botta and colleagues.B12)

With increasing use of CT as the primary diagnostic imaging study, aortography is being used less frequently. In a multicenter study by the AAST, it was used to screen for traumatic aortic disruption in only 8.3% of 193 patients treated during a 26-month interval in 2005-2007, as compared with 87% of 274 patients treated during a 30-month interval in 1994 to 1996.D4

#### *Magnetic Resonance Imaging*

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides excellent images of vascular structures in the thoracic aorta and provides diagnostic accuracy similar to aortography.F2 Its use in the acute trauma patient is limited because of the confining nature of the scanners and the time required to obtain images.

#### NATURAL HISTORY

Risk of death, generally from massive intrathoracic hemorrhage, is greatest immediately after the injury. As time passes, the instantaneous risk of death (hazard function) decreases, but the patient remains at risk of death from hemorrhagic shock over the next several days (Fig. 24-6). Shock may be secondary either to initial blood loss into a large mediastinal hematoma or to renewed bleeding into the adventitia and mediastinal pleura as arterial blood pressure rises after the initial period of hypotension.P1 Probability of survival for at least 4 hours after the accident is not improved with certainty by rapid transport from accident scene to hospital.C15 About 40% to 50% of persons die within 48 hours of the traumatic event.A8

Instantaneous risk of death in surgically untreated patients begins to level off about 7 days after injury (see Fig. 24-6). Most patients who survive this long without treatment survive much longer. However, a low constant risk of death from hemorrhage persists because of propensity of the false aneurysm (see Morphology earlier in this chapter) to rupture even years later.C6 It has been estimated that even after 10 years, 20% of patients with this type of traumatic false aneurysm will die of rupture within the subsequent 5 years.B3,G9

#### TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

#### Preoperative Management

When a presumptive diagnosis of acute traumatic aortic disruption or other major vascular injury is made based on an abnormal chest radiograph, hemodynamic monitoring and medical therapy are instituted before diagnostic imaging (CT, TEE, or aortography) is performed. In hemodynamically

### Repair of Acute Traumatic Aortic Disruption of Upper Descending Thoracic Aorta

#### Operative Strategies

Open operative repair has been the standard surgical treatment of traumatic aortic disruption of the descending thoracic aorta for more than 50 years. Development and recent widespread availability of endovascular stent-grafts have dramatically altered management. The first patients with traumatic aortic disruption of the descending thoracic aorta treated this way were reported by Kato and colleagues in 1997. K3 The technique is now widely used in trauma centers throughout the world. A prospective multicenter study by the AAST reported by Demetriades and colleagues compared the methods of definitive repair of traumatic aortic disruption in two time intervals: 1994-1996 (274 patients, 50 participating centers) and 2005-2007 (193 patients, 18 participating centers)<sup>D4</sup> (Table 24-1). In the latter interval, 65% of patients were treated with stent-grafts. Although there are no randomized trials comparing endovascular stent-grafting with open repair, ease of insertion, reduced operative time, and reduction in major postoperative complications are attractive features of the technique that have led to increasing use.

#### Open Repair

Spinal cord ischemic injury resulting in paraplegia or paraparesis is a devastating complication of surgical repair, and the optimal technique for avoiding injury to the spinal cord during open repair remains arguable (see detailed discussion in "Paraplegia after Aortic Clamping" under Special Situations and Controversies later in this chapter). In their metaanalysis, von Oppell and colleagues noted that the mean number of patients with acute traumatic aortic disruption admitted to any unspecified center was 2.6 per year (range 0.2-10.7 patients). V5 The centers in most of the reports (39) of 60 with data suitable for analysis) treated fewer than this mean number of patients per year. Thus, annual experience with this condition is limited in all but a few centers. With simple aortic clamping, von Oppell and colleagues found that the earliest reported case of paraplegia occurred after a clamp time of 24 minutes; if clamp time extended to 34 minutes, cumulative risk of paraplegia increased to 18%. At 60 minutes, risk approached 80%, and at 120 minutes, 100%. In contrast, when distal aortic perfusion was used, the earliest paraplegia occurred after a clamp time of 34 minutes, and risk of

Shaded areas indicate one standard error bands. (\*Clamp time [31 minutes] of earliest evident difference between the two groups [*P* < .05; Fisher's exact test]; \*\**P* < .00001 cumulative risk for augmented distal perfusion group compared with simple aortic clamp group [Mantel-Cox].) (From von Oppell and colleagues.V5)

paraplegia at 120 minutes was approximately 18% (*P* < .0001)V5 (Fig. 24-7).

A comparable protective effect of distal aortic perfusion was demonstrated in a subsequent meta-analysis by Jahromi and colleaguesJ2 and in a single institution by Katz and colleagues.K5 Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that distal aortic perfusion, achieved either by partial cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and mild hypothermia or by left atrial–to–distal arterial bypass, should be used for most patients with acute traumatic aortic disruption undergoing open repair. Simple aortic clamping should be reserved for patients in whom anticipated clamp time is less than 20 to 25 minutes (although this is not always predictable) and for patients with life-threatening hemorrhage.K5,S19,V5

An arterial catheter is inserted in the patient's right arm to monitor blood pressure; nasopharyngeal and bladder or rectal thermistors are placed for temperature measurement. If not already in place, a Swan-Ganz catheter is inserted for measurement of pulmonary artery pressure and cardiac output. A double-lumen endotracheal tube is inserted whenever possible. At least one large-bore needle must be securely in position in a peripheral vein. The patient is placed in a right lateral decubitus position, but with hips rolled back toward a supine position so that the left femoral vessels are accessible (Fig. 24-8, *A* [inset]). Facilities are organized for aspirating shed blood from the thorax in a sterile manner, washing and compacting red blood cells, and rapidly returning them to the patient.

A left posterolateral incision is made, and the thorax is entered through either the fourth intercostal space or the bed of the resected fifth rib. The rib spreader is positioned and opened in stages over several minutes, and the opening into the thorax anteriorly and posteriorly is lengthened with scissors. As soon as the rib spreader has been partially opened, unclotted blood and clots are removed from the thorax, taking great care not to exacerbate the bleeding by disturbing the mediastinal hematoma. Usually there is no active bleeding into the pleural space (persons with such bleeding usually have not survived to this point), but if it is occurring, immediate control is obtained by digital pressure.

Once the rib spreader has been positioned, the lung is covered with a moist laparotomy pad and retracted anteriorly with a malleable retractor held by an assistant. The mediastinal pleura is still undisturbed, and at this point a decision is made about the technique that will be used for spinal cord protection during aortic clamping (see previous text and "Paraplegia after Aortic Clamping" under Special Situations and Controversies later in this chapter).

A synthetic aortic tube graft is then selected (see "Grafts for Use in Aortic Surgery" under Special Situations and Controversies later in this chapter), as are clamps for aortic control. A few stay sutures are placed along the mediastinum behind the hilum of the lung and held anteriorly by clamps, which replace the malleable retractor.

The mediastinal pleura is opened adjacent to the hematoma at three points: (1) over the mid-descending thoracic aorta, (2) over the aortic arch, and (3) over the left subclavian artery (see Fig. 24-8, *A-B*). Dissection is carried around the aorta and subclavian artery at these three sites so that clamps can be placed. Tapes can be placed around the vessels, but they are not necessary and generally should be avoided. If accessible, the vagus nerve—identified as it descends over the aorta—is protected. When the hematoma is small and general condition of the patient is good, dissection is carried along the anterior surface of the aorta toward the hematoma from below, and down the aortic arch and the subclavian artery from above. The aortic arch is usually dissected circumferentially between the left carotid and left subclavian arteries (see Fig. 24-8, *B*).

When the hematoma is extensive or the hemodynamic state is unstable, dissection is not performed until the clamps are in place. When this dissection has been accomplished, clamps are placed in a preliminary manner, one across the aortic arch between the left carotid and left subclavian arteries, one across the subclavian artery, and one on the descending thoracic aorta (Fig. 24-8, *C*). With this maneuver, reasonable control of bleeding can be established, although there may be bleeding retrogradely into the aorta from intercostal arteries above the distal aortic clamp. After the clamps are placed, dissection is carried toward the hematoma from the distal clamp, and this clamp is expeditiously moved proximally as far as possible to allow blood from the distal aorta to perfuse as many intercostal arteries as possible. The surgeon must recognize that clamping the distal aortic arch rather than aorta beyond the left subclavian artery causes a greater increase in left ventricular afterload and also decreases collateral flow to the lower body and spinal cord from the left subclavian artery. Thus, whenever possible, the clamps on the arch and left subclavian artery should be replaced with one on the aorta just beyond the left subclavian artery (Fig. 24-8, *D*).

Dissection now continues toward the site of disruption, staying in the periaortic tissue plane (see Fig. 24-8, *C*). At some point the hematoma is entered, and blood and clot are evacuated rapidly. Usually there will be some bleeding into the field from the intercostal arteries between the disruption

Subpleural hematoma distorts aorta in region of ligamentum arteriosum. Initial steps of retracting left lung, identifying and isolating left vagus and left recurrent laryngeal nerves, and making small incisions in mediastinal pleura *(black ovals)* for later clamp placement are shown. **B,** Initial stages of dissection. Mediastinal pleura is incised adjacent to hematoma over aortic arch proximal to left subclavian artery, over origin of left subclavian artery, and over descending aorta.

and distal clamp. This blood should be aspirated through a system that returns blood to the patient. Alternatively, the bleeding intercostal arteries can be occluded with bulldog clamps (see Fig. 24-8, *D*). They should not be ligated or oversewn (see "Paraplegia after Aortic Clamping" under Special Situations and Controversies later in this chapter); the aorta can often be tailored to preserve their origins.

When disruption involves only part of the circumference of the aorta, direct repair can often be made with interrupted pledgeted everting mattress sutures or a simple whip stitch of 4-0 or 5-0 polypropyleneA5 (Fig. 24-8, *E*). Although Fontan and colleagues report being always able to make a direct repair with partial or complete disruption,F6,F8 this method is considered advisable only if the tissues are of good quality. Otherwise, a segment of the tube graft already selected is anastomosed to the two ends of the aorta using a 4-0 or 5-0 polypropylene suture (Fig. 24-8, *F-G*). The distal clamp is released, anastomotic bleeding between the sutures is secured with fine interrupted sutures, and the proximal clamp is slowly removed. Disruptions that involve the middle or lower descending thoracic aorta are repaired in a similar fashion after obtaining proximal and distal control of the aorta.R1

![](_page_8_Figure_2.jpeg)

**C,** Dissection is continued around the aorta and left subclavian artery in these locations, and clamps are placed first on the proximal aorta between the left carotid and left subclavian artery then on the left subclavian artery, and finally on the distal aorta. Pleura over mediastinal hematoma is incised, and hematoma is removed. **D,** Aortic clamps are repositioned, wherever possible, to locations just above and below area of disruption to permit perfusion of subclavian artery and as many pairs of intercostal arteries as possible. Bleeding from intercostal arteries closest to the aortic tear is controlled with bulldog clamps. **E,** If tear is incomplete, aorta can be repaired by direct suture. **Figure 24-8, cont'd** *Continued*

For patients in shock resulting from massive intra-thoracic hemorrhage, full cardiopulmonary bypass and hypothermic circulatory arrest permits salvage of the shed blood in the pleural space and mediastinum and eliminates the need for mediastinal dissection of placement of clamps proximal and distal to the aortic tear. Kawahito and Adachi utilized this technique in 10 patients with hemorrhagic shock and major associated injuries.K14 Nine of the patients were discharged from the hospital without complications.

After repair is completed and any devices used for distal aortic perfusion have been removed, as much of the mediastinal pleura as possible is closed over the operative site. One intercostal drainage catheter is positioned posteriorly and inferiorly in the chest cavity, and another anteriorly and superiorly. The incision is closed after making certain the lung has been reexpanded and the catheters are attached to a suction apparatus.

#### *Endovascular Stent-Grafting*

Endovascular stent-grafting should be performed under general anesthesia in a standard cardiovascular operating

![](_page_9_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 24-8, cont'd F-G,** In most cases, a woven polyester tube graft is sutured to proximal and then distal aorta.

**Figure 24-9** Same patient as in Fig. 24-3. After deploying an endovascular stent-graft, the disrupted aorta is excluded **(A)**, and flow to the left subclavian artery has been preserved **(B)**. (From Botta and colleagues.B12)

room with a C-arm fluoroscopy unit, or in a "hybrid" operating room with a fluoroscopy unit designed for endovascular surgery. The operating team must be prepared to convert to an open procedure if necessary, and a cardiopulmonary perfusion team should be available on standby.

Access to the aorta is established through a common femoral, external iliac, or common iliac artery. If the common femoral artery is large enough to admit the sheath necessary for deployment of the endovascular stent-graft (EVSG), the procedure can be performed percutaneously or through a small incision in the groin area. If the femoral artery is not of suitable size, access is obtained through a small extraperitoneal incision in a lower quadrant of the abdominal wall to expose the external or common iliac artery. An 8- or 10-mm segment of collagen- or gelatin-impregnated polyester graft is sutured end-to-side to the artery and is used as a conduit through which the graft is deployed. Only low-dose heparinization (2500-5000 units) is required.

Appropriate flexible guidewires are advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the ascending aorta, and the sheath through which the EVSG will be inserted is passed over the guidewire and positioned in the abdominal aorta. The diameter of the aorta proximal and distal to the site of the tear is determined from a previously obtained CT angiogram (or alternatively, using TEE or intravascular ultrasound), and the appropriate-sized EVSG is selected. The diameter of the graft is 10% to 15% greater than the diameter of the aorta. In general, 2 cm of aorta proximal and distal to the site of disruption is essential for proper sealing of the graft. This may require covering the orifice of the left subclavian artery. Length of the graft should only be long enough to ensure an adequate seal, thus avoiding unnecessary coverage of adjacent intercostal arteries. Once the graft is deployed, angiography or CT imaging is performed to assess adequacy of the seal and to be certain that the left carotid artery has not been compromised (Fig. 24-9). If the left subclavian artery is covered and there is evidence postoperatively of compromised circulation to the left arm, a left carotid–to–left subclavian artery bypass graft with simultaneous embolization of the proximal left subclavian artery, or left subclavian artery transposition to left carotid artery, should be performed.

After satisfactory deployment of the EVSG has been confirmed, the sheath and guidewires are removed, and the artery through which they were inserted is repaired with a 5-0 or 6-0 polypropylene suture. If a graft was used for access, it is excised, leaving a small remnant attached to the artery that is oversewn with a 5-0 or 6-0 polypropylene suture.

#### Repair of Acute Traumatic Disruption of Ascending Aorta

When the ascending aorta is disrupted, preparations are made for standard CPB as the patient is being transferred to the operating room (see "Preparation for Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2).

In the operating room, the usual peripheral and monitoring devices are placed. After the patient is anesthetized and intubated, one member of the surgical team performs a median sternotomy while another exposes a common femoral artery and vein in the groin. The pericardium is opened just enough to expose the right atrial appendage. No dissection should be performed in the region of the hematoma. If there is active bleeding, control is obtained with digital pressure.

The patient is heparinized and the femoral artery cannulated. A single right atrial venous cannula is placed (see Cardiopulmonary Bypass Established by Peripheral Cannulation in Section III of Chapter 2) and CPB established. If the right atrium is not accessible, a long cannula is inserted from a common femoral vein (preferably the right) and positioned with its tip in the middle of the right atrium. Body temperature is reduced by cooling the perfusate (see "Technique in Adults" in Section IV of Chapter 2). As this is being done, the thymus gland is divided, the pericardium is opened more widely, and the pericardial reflection is carefully dissected away from the hematoma over the distal portion of the ascending aorta. If massive hemorrhage occurs, perfusion flow is reduced to 0.5 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> until enough of the aorta can be dissected to place an aortic occlusion clamp beyond the site of disruption. If the tear does not involve the brachiocephalic trunk, this clamp is placed just proximal to its origin from the aorta, although the clamp may have to be angled so that it excludes more of the undersurface of the aortic arch. Once this clamp is positioned, full CPB flow may be resumed and perfusate temperature stabilized at 28°C to 32°C.

After this clamp has been placed, the aorta is opened and cardioplegic solution is administered directly into the ostia of the coronary arteries using perfusion cannulae (see "Perfusion of Individual Coronary Arteries" in Chapter 3). Alternatively, or as an adjunctive measure, cardioplegic solution can be infused retrogradely into the coronary sinus (see "Technique of Retrograde Infusion" in Chapter 3). A venting catheter is placed into the left ventricle, either through a purse-string suture in the right superior pulmonary vein or through the opened aorta.

The area of disruption is dissected carefully. Usually there has been sufficient damage to the aorta that a tube graft is required for reconstruction of aortic continuity (see "Grafts for Use in Aortic Surgery" under Special Situations and Controversies later in this chapter). Repair is made by the technique described for graft interposition for descending thoracic aortic disruptions (see previous text). After the anastomosis is completed, the clamp on the aorta is released. Aortic root reperfusion is begun, and the remainder of the procedure is completed (see "De-airing the Heart" in Section III of Chapter 2).

If the disruption clearly involves the brachiocephalic trunk or aortic arch, or if it is unclear whether the brachiocephalic trunk is involved, no dissection or manipulation of the aorta and hematoma is begun until the patient has been cooled by the perfusate to a nasopharyngeal temperature below 18°C. Then, with the patient in moderate Trendelenburg position, CPB is discontinued, an aortic clamp is placed across the uninvolved proximal portion of the aorta, cardioplegic solution is administered through a previously placed aortic infusion cannula, and the aorta is opened at the area of disruption without placing a clamp distally. Repair is accomplished by the technique used to repair aortic arch aneurysms (see "Replacement of Aortic Arch" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 26). When disruption involves the origin of the brachiocephalic trunk or left carotid artery, the damaged segment is resected and an appropriately sized collagen- or gelatin-impregnated woven polyester graft is sutured to the normal artery distally and to the aortic arch proximally, or to the graft that has replaced the aortic arch and ascending aorta.

#### SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Postoperative care is that usually given after other major cardiovascular operations (see Chapter 5). Many patients have systemic hypertension early postoperatively, and particular care is taken to control it. Associated injuries are managed appropriately.

#### RESULTS

#### Survival

#### *Early (Hospital) Death*

Many patients who would otherwise have died survive after repair of acute traumatic aortic disruption, but the proportion surviving varies according to the particular circumstances. Associated severe injuries decrease probability of survival. Paradoxically, rapid transport systems between accident site and hospital, although giving the patient a potentially better chance to survive, may actually decrease the proportion of surgical survivors, because more severely injured patients reach the hospital.A4,A6,B9,C15,K8

**Open Operation** VonOppell and colleagues performed a meta-analysis of 88 articles published in English between 1972 and 1992 related to surgical management of acute aortic disruption in which sufficient information was available to permit estimation of mortality and prevalence of paraplegia.V5 Of 1742 patients who reached the hospital alive, 179 (10%) died before surgical intervention. An additional 61 patients (3.5%) exsanguinated despite emergency thoracotomy for profound hemodynamic deterioration. Ten patients were managed without operation. Intraoperative deaths occurred in 111 patients (6.7%), and an additional 201 patients (11.5%) died in the postoperative period. Thus, overall mortality for patients who arrived at the hospital alive was 32% (Table 24-2). Of 1492 patients who reached the operating room in a presumably stable hemodynamic state, mortality was 21%. This mortality ranged from 0% to 54% in individual institutions.

In a more recent analysis, Demetriades and colleagues reported a 24% early mortality rate among 68 patients treated between 2005 and 2007 in 18 trauma centers.D5 In a metaanalysis of 17 retrospective cohort studies from 2003 to 2007 involving 369 patients treated with open repair, 30-day mortality was 20% (72 patients; CL 17%-22%).X1 It ranged from 0% to 50% in individual centers.

**Endovascular Stent-Grafting** In the study of Demetriades and colleagues noted previously, early mortality for 125 patients treated concurrently by EVSG was 7.2% (9 patients; CL 4.9%-10%).D5 In the meta-analysis of 17 retrospective cohort studies by Xenos and colleagues, 30-day mortality for 220 patients treated concurrently by EVSG was 7.9% (18 patients; CL 6.1%-10.0%).X1 It ranged from 0% to 25% in individual centers.

#### *Time-Related Survival*

Long-term survival of patients discharged after open repair is excellent.F6 Long-term results after EVSG are unknown.

#### *Modes of Death*

Most deaths occur in the postoperative period (see Table 24-2). Principal modes of intraoperative death are hemorrhagic shock and cardiac failure.D8,K8,T3 Modes of postoperative death are central nervous system injury and organ failure (lung, kidney, liver).

#### *Risk Factors for Premature Death*

A higher Injury Severity Score (ISS) and older age appear to be important risk factors for increased hospital mortality.C3,C15,D8,S9 Surgical technique is not a risk factor for hospital mortality.J2

#### *Paraplegia*

The proportion of patients who develop paraplegia or paraparesis after open surgical repair is variable. In the metaanalysis of von Oppell and colleagues, new paraplegia occurred in 9.9% (CL 9.1%-10.8%) of the 1492 patients who reached the operating room (see Table 24-2).V5 Prevalence of paraplegia varied according to the operative technique used (Table 24-3; *P* < .0001). Highest prevalence (19%) was associated with use of simple aortic clamping; lowest prevalence (2.3%) was associated with "active shunting," defined as augmentation of distal perfusion by CPB with an oxygenator and full CPB, by a centrifugal pump and no heparin, or by femoral vein to femoral artery bypass without an oxygenator or heparin. Prevalence with "passive shunting" (no augmentation of distal perfusion) was 11% (*P* < .0001 compared with "active shunting"). Categorization of surgical technique employed was possible in 96% of the 1492 patients.V5 The high prevalence of paraplegia in the simple aortic clamping group was associated with the lowest weighted average clamp time (32 minutes; range 13-62 minutes) (see Table 24-3 and "Paraplegia after Aortic Clamping" under Special Situations and Controversies later in this chapter). In the meta-analysis of Jahromi and colleagues of 618 patients from 20 reports published between 1966 and 2000, a lower prevalence of paraplegia was observed among patients in whom left heart bypass (0 of 84 [0%; CL 0%-2.3%]; odds ratio 6.4; *P* = .07) or partial CPB (5 of 227 [2%; CL 1.2%-3.7%]; odds ratio 3.4;

Prevalence of paraplegia after EVSG is lower than that after open repair. In the study of the AAST, paraplegia occurred in 1 (0.8%) of 125 patients treated by EVSG between 2005 and 2007.D5 In the meta-analysis of 17 retrospective cohort studies of 215 patients treated by EVSG from 2003-2007 and with data suitable for analysis, paraplegia/ paraparesis occurred in 1 patient (0.5%).X1

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Immediate surgical repair of acute traumatic aortic disruption is indicated for patients with massive hemothorax or signs of impending rupture. Among patients in whom the hematoma is contained within the mediastinum, immediate repair is usually indicated unless there are severe coexisting injuries that require medical or surgical management. Several studies have demonstrated that mortality from rupture among patients who reach the hospital alive and who have a contained rupture is low (approximately 5%).A4,C24,M2,P3 Thus, injuries that may be more immediately life threatening (e.g., intraabdominal or intracranial hemorrhage, severe pulmonary or myocardial contusion, extensive fractures) should be treated before repair of the aortic disruption.

When diagnosis is made more than several days after injury, operation is usually advisable, but unless the hematoma is large or there is evidence of active bleeding, operation can be performed urgently or electively rather than emergently. In the interim, arterial hypertension and tachycardia should be treated with sodium nitroprusside and β-adrenergic blockade.A4,P3 Frequent monitoring of the thoracic aorta with CT scanning or MRI is essential during this interval.G1,P6

After about 14 days, management is similar to that for chronic thoracic aortic aneurysm (see "Special Features of Postoperative Care" in Chapter 26).

#### SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

#### Choice of Operative Procedure

As noted, EVSG has replaced open operation as the most commonly performed intervention for acute traumatic aortic disruption. It is associated with lower early mortality and a lower occurrence of paraplegia.D5,X1 Other advantages over open operation include avoidance of thoracotomy, aortic clamping, and left heart bypass or CPB.

However, endovascular treatment requires expeditious imaging, personnel trained in endovascular procedures, and availability of endografts of variable sizes. Currently in the United States, treatment of acute traumatic aortic disruption with an endograft is an off-label use of the device. Because the aortas of younger individuals are smaller than those of patients with aneurysms, for which these devices were initially designed, oversizing has been associated with collapse of the stent-graft.F3,I1 Other complications unique to EVSG include endoleaks, component migration, stent fractures, injury to the arteries used for access, and cerebral or left upperextremity ischemic events resulting from coverage of the left subclavian and left carotid arteries.R4,X1 In the study by the AAST, prevalence of device-related complications among 125 patients was 20% (CL 16%-24%).D5 In a review by Lettinga-van de Poll and colleagues of 284 patients treated in 62 centers up until January 2006, procedure-related complications occurred in 41 patients (14%; CL 12%-17%).L6 Need for repeat intervention is also a concern.F3

Long-term results of EVSG are unknown. The thoracic aorta becomes ectatic and tortuous with aging, so there is a theoretical risk of graft dislodgement over time. A study of proximal aortic diameters using CT imaging following endovascular repair of blunt thoracic aortic injury in 17 patients followed for at least one year, demonstrated a significant increase in the rate of dilatation at the level of the aortic isthmus when compared with the aorta distal to the end of the endograft (0.83 mm/yr vs. 0.47 mm/yr, P=.025).F10 Long-term performance and mechanical properties of currently used grafts are unknown. Frequent imaging, currently with CT, is recommended and may be necessary for the life of the patient. Cost of this imaging and the associated risk of excessive radiation are not insignificant.

All these factors must be taken into consideration when deciding on the method of operative management for individual patients. Until additional information becomes available, a selective strategy, treating young patients with limited associated injuries by open operation and older patients with comorbid conditions or those with extensive associated injuries by EVSG, may be advisable.

#### Paraplegia after Aortic Clamping

Paraplegia or paraparesis can develop as a result of ischemia of the spinal cord after operations in which the distal aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta, or thoracoabdominal aorta is temporarily clamped.A3,L1,L3,W2 It usually develops immediately, but occasionally onset is delayed for several hours or days.

#### *Risk Factors*

**Duration of Aortic Clamping** When the aorta is clamped just beyond the left subclavian artery under more or less normothermic conditions, probability of developing paraplegia or paraparesis is directly related to duration of clamping. In humans, this probability is essentially zero when duration is less than 15 minutes. In patients with acute traumatic aortic disruption, the probability approaches 100% when duration is 1 hour or longerK5,V5 (see Fig. 24-7). For patients with extensive descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms or dissections in whom simple aortic clamping is used, duration of aortic clamping is an important predictor of developing paraplegia or paraparesis.D3,S13,S14

**Temperature** Hypothermia has a marked protective effect on spinal cord function during periods of aortic occlusion in experimental animals.O2,P8,R6,R9 In clinical studies, use of moderate or profound systemic hypothermia has been associated with lower prevalence of spinal cord ischemia after operations on the descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta compared with operations performed at normothermia.F9,K9,K13 Use of profound systemic hypothermia (<20°C) permits extension of the duration of aortic occlusion and spinal cord ischemia to more than 100 minutes without an increase in prevalence of paraplegia or paraparesisK9,K12 (Fig. 24-10). Selective cooling of the spinal cord by infusion of cold (4°C) saline into the epidural space to achieve cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) temperatures of 24°C to 28°C has been associated with lower prevalence of spinal cord ischemic injury following

![](_page_13_Figure_2.jpeg)

Figure 24-10 Risk of paraplegia or paraparesis according to duration of spinal cord ischemia in 60 patients undergoing resection and graft replacement of the descending thoracic aorta using hypothermic (under 20°C) cardiopulmonary bypass and intervals of circulatory arrest. Duration of spinal cord ischemia was defined as time between onset of circulatory arrest or aortic clamping and establishment of antegrade flow to intercostal and lumbar arteries below the T6 interspace. Dashed lines enclose 70% confidence intervals. *P* value relates to association between ischemic time and probability of developing paraplegia or paraparesis. (Modified from Kouchoukos and colleagues. <sup>K9</sup>)

repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm with the simple aortic clamping technique than observed without cooling in otherwise comparable patients. C1

**Level of Aortic Clamping** When a clamp is placed for 60 minutes on the abdominal aorta beyond the origin of the renal arteries (about the level of L2), paraplegia or paraparesis occurs in less than 0.1% of cases. C16 When a clamp is placed at the level of the diaphragm for 60 minutes, paraplegia or paraparesis develops in about 10% of patients. S14 As already discussed, when the proximal clamp is on the aorta just beyond the origin of the left subclavian artery for 60 minutes in patients with acute traumatic aortic disruption, more than 80% develop clinical evidence of spinal cord ischemic injury.

Evidence from experimental studies indicates that clamping of the left subclavian artery and the thoracic aorta just beyond the origin of the left subclavian artery further increases risk of paraplegia or paraparesis. S6,W1 This is because the left subclavian artery gives origin to the left vertebral artery, which joins with the right vertebral artery to form the anterior spinal artery.

When two clamps are placed across the thoracic aorta, the distance between them is related directly to probability of paraplegia, at least in experimental animals. P8,W1 This implies that as the distance between the clamps is increased, more of the intercostal arteries, and thus the spinal arteries, are excluded from the collateral circulation coming from the proximal and distal aorta.

Variability in Blood Supply of Spinal Cord The anterior spinal artery is formed at the level of the medulla by spinal artery branches from each of the vertebral arteries. As the anterior spinal artery passes down the spinal cord, it is connected to a variable number of radicular arteries (usually five to eight) that are formed from spinal branches of the intercostal and lumbar arterial branches of the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta<sup>D7,S10,W2</sup> (Fig. 24-11). A particularly large

![](_page_13_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Figure 24-11** Summary of findings of the blood supply to the spinal cord in eight human cadaver dissections. Sizes are mean sizes for these arteries when distended under pressure with blood. Level of origin of the arteries may vary in any one person; however, the diagram summarizes the most commonly identified sites of origin. Key: *ARM*, Arteria radicularis magna; *C*, cervical; *L*, lumbar;  $\mu$ , microns; *T*, thoracic. (From Svensson and Crawford. <sup>512</sup>)

radicular artery is present in most humans (the arteria radicularis magna, or artery of Adamkiewicz). It arises from the T5 (fifth thoracic vertebral level) to the T8 level in 15% of people, T9 to T12 in 75%, L1 to L2 (lumbar level) in 8%, L3 in 1.4%, and L4 to L5 in 0.2%. J3,P7 Its ligation in pigs usually results in paraplegia or paralysis. W2 Clamping the aorta distal to the origin of this large artery probably imposes only a small risk of paraplegia or paraparesis, whereas clamping proximal to it imposes a considerable risk. In the latter situation, perfusion of the distal aorta may provide adequate protection of the lumbar spinal cord if perfusion pressures are adequate. If the segment of aorta that contains this or other large radicular arteries is resected or excluded, or if the artery is ligated, there is considerable probability of paraplegia or paraparesis. S6,W2 In this circumstance, reimplantation of the critical intercostal artery or arteries is advisable.

Variability in Collateral Circulation to Spinal Cord When collateral circulation around the part of the aorta exteriorized by a pair of aortic clamps is well developed, as in most patients undergoing operation for aortic coarctation, the aorta can probably be clamped safely at that level for a long interval. However, some patients with coarctation have incomplete collateral circulation and greater likelihood of developing paraplegia<sup>B14</sup> (see "Collateral Circulation" under Morphology in Section I of Chapter 48).

Patients coming to operation for chronic degenerative descending thoracic or thoracoabdominal aneurysm frequently have little or no flow through some of the intercostal or lumbar arteries because of previous progressive occlusion of the origins of these arteries from the aorta. This usually

chronic process is infrequently associated with paraplegia because of concomitant development of collateral circulation. The collateral circulation, when well developed, may be sufficient to permit aortic occlusion without ischemic injury to the spinal cord.E2,E3 However, it can also be precarious and sensitive to even minor fluctuations in arterial pressure, cardiac output, and intraspinal pressure during and early after graft replacement of the diseased aortic segment.

**Intraspinal Pressure** An increase in intraspinal pressure, which can occur following occlusion of the descending thoracic aorta, is believed to increase spinal cord ischemia and thus the probability of paraplegia.B4,B8,M8 Presumably, increased intraspinal pressure compresses the delicate spinal arteries sufficiently to reduce blood flow through them. In theory, increase in pressure, reflected by increase in the measured intrathecal pressure, reduces spinal cord perfusion pressure (defined as distal aortic pressure minus CSF pressure). Increased venous pressure may result following occlusion of the thoracic aorta and may also increase CSF pressure, thus reducing spinal cord perfusion pressure.P5

**Upper Body Blood Pressure** Reduction of upper body blood pressure when the thoracic aorta is clamped decreases flow (through collaterals) to the lower body and reduces spinal cord collateral flow. Thus, upper body hypotension during aortic clamping increases the probability of paraplegia.C19

#### *Methods to Minimize Spinal Cord Injury*

Generally, aortic operations should be performed in a manner that recognizes the risk factors for paraplegia while accomplishing an effective procedure with minimal blood loss and injury to various organs. At times, difficult situations may force compromises:

- A double-lumen endotracheal tube should be used whenever possible to permit optimal exposure in the left hemithorax.
- If the aorta is clamped without distal perfusion, upper body blood pressure should be maintained above normal values. Cardiac function should be monitored carefully.
- The proximal aortic clamp should be placed beyond the left subclavian artery whenever possible and as far distally on the aorta as possible.
- The more distal of a pair of clamps should be positioned as close to the distal extent of the disruption as possible.
- Operation should be planned and performed to minimize duration of aortic occlusion.
- Hemostasis should be accurate to avoid hypotension after removal of the clamps.

**Whole-Body Hypothermia during Simple Aortic Clamping** Hypothermia clearly prolongs the safe ischemic time for the spinal cord, just as it does for all other organsR6 (see Section I of Chapter 2). This was demonstrated more than 50 years ago by Hufnagel and Gross,H2 later by Beattie and colleagues,B1 and reaffirmed by the elegant experimental study of Pontius and colleagues.P8 The studies of these three groups indicate that the spinal cord can recover normal function after aortic occlusion for 60 minutes at a whole-body temperature of 30°C.

Hypothermia to a nasopharyngeal temperature of 30°C to 32°C can be achieved simply. In neonates and infants, operation is performed with the patient on a cooling and heating pad and with operating room temperature about 16°C (60°F) during thoracotomy. If at the time of aortic clamping, the patient's temperature has not reached 32°C to 33°C, additional cooling is obtained by 5 to 10 minutes of ice water lavage of the left pleural space. Even in adults, such lavage is effective in reducing body temperature 2°C to 3°C within 5 to 10 minutes. In neonates and small infants, rewarming after the clamps are removed is easily accomplished with the pad (now heating rather than cooling) and by raising room temperature. The rewarming process is slower in larger patients but can be facilitated by use of a warming blanket placed over the lower abdomen and legs.

Cooling to 30°C or lower without extracorporeal support usually requires formal surface cooling, which is cumbersome and time consuming in large patients. It is generally inadvisable for operations on the descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta.

**Perfusion of Distal Aorta during Aortic Clamping** When a pair of aortic clamps are applied close together to the most proximal part of the descending thoracic aorta (e.g., in operations for acute traumatic aortic disruption), perfusion of the distal aorta by any one of a number of methods minimizes spinal cord ischemia and development of paraplegia.L1,L3 This was demonstrated by Stranahan and colleagues in 1954 by use of an external shunt.S7 However, distal aortic perfusion prevents paraplegia only if the short segment of aorta exteriorized by the clamps does not give origin to critical radicular blood supply to the spinal cord (see "Variability in Blood Supply of Spinal Cord" earlier in this chapter). If the critical arteries originate from the exteriorized segment and the aortic clamps remain in position for a considerable period, perfusion of the distal aorta cannot be expected to afford complete protection to the spinal cord consistently.

The study by Katz and colleaguesK5 and the meta-analyses of von Oppell and colleaguesV5 and Jahromi and colleaguesJ2 support the concept that managing acute traumatic aortic disruption by perfusing the distal aorta while a pair of aortic clamps is on the upper descending thoracic aorta neutralizes the incremental risk of longer clamp times on probability of paraplegia (see Fig. 24-7). Other studies also support this concept by showing that distal aortic perfusion restores spinal cord blood flow, maintains spinal cord function, and restores function temporarily lost by a brief period of inadequate perfusion of the distal aorta.C22,L1,L3 The experimental studies of Connolly and colleagues and Laschinger and colleagues suggest that distal aortic pressure needs to be about 60 to 70 mmHg or more to provide low probability of paraplegia and high probability of adequate lower-body organ function during and after an operation performed at normothermia (≈37°C).C11,L3

**Reattachment of Intercostal and Lumbar Arteries** During resection of a segment of the thoracic or upper abdominal aorta from which arteries critical to spinal cord blood flow emerge, perfusion of the intercostal and lumbar arteries seems logical, as does their reattachment to the aorta as part of the reconstruction. One way of accomplishing reconstruction of spinal cord blood flow is tailoring the resection and graft so that most of the posterior wall of the aorta, from which origins of the lower intercostal and lumbar arteries arise, is preserved (see Fig. 25-11, *D* in Chapter 25). The graft is cut obliquely at one end for an appropriate end-toend anastomosis. Another method is creation of an oval opening in the graft and anastomosis of the opening to the aortic wall around the origin of critical intercostal and lumbar arteries (see Fig. 26-18, *F-G* in Chapter 26).

The importance of reattaching intercostal and lumbar arteries in preventing spinal cord ischemic injury and the resulting paralysis remains controversial. Several groups have reported a low prevalence of neurologic deficits after resection and graft replacement of extensive thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms without reattaching any intercostal or lumbar arteries.A1,E1,G8 However, emerging consensus is that, at least for extensive thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms that require prolonged periods of aortic occlusion—particularly those resulting from aortic dissection where large numbers of intercostal and lumbar arteries may be patent—reattachment of patent lower intercostal (below the T6 or T7 level) and upper lumbar arteries reduces the prevalence of postoperative neurologic deficits.C1,C13,K9,S1,S2,S15

**Drainage of Cerebrospinal Fluid** In experimental studies, reducing intraspinal pressure by drainage of CSF is associated with reduced prevalence of paraplegia.B8,D1 In some clinical studies, the protective effect of CSF drainage has not been conclusively demonstrated when comparable groups of patients (randomized and nonrandomized) are evaluated.C20,M10 In three clinical studies and in a randomized trial, use of CSF drainage in combination with other adjuncts such as distal aortic perfusion, intravenous infusion of naloxone, an endorphin (opiate) receptor antagonist, and epidural cooling has been associated with reduced prevalence of lower-extremity neurologic deficits compared with historical controls.A1,C1,C14,S2

**Localized Cooling of Spinal Cord during Aortic Clamping** Experimental studies by Coles and colleaguesC9 and Colon and colleaguesC10 have shown that infusing cold crystalloid solution or blood into an isolated segment of the descending aorta provides protection against paraplegia for an occlusion period of 30 to 45 minutes. Berguer and colleaguesB5 and Wisselink and colleaguesW3 demonstrated the protective effect of irrigating the subarachnoid space with cold (5°C) saline solution during an occlusion interval of 45 minutes in dogs, and Marsala and colleaguesM4 showed similar protection with cold irrigation of the epidural space. Clinical experience with these techniques is limited. Fehrenbacher and colleagues have used infusion of 8°C to 10°C crystalloid solution containing heparin, mannitol, and methylprednisolone into isolated segments of the lower thoracic and upper abdominal aorta before implanting the intercostal and lumbar arteries contained in these segments into an aortic graft.F5 Normothermic left heart bypass and segmental clamping of the aorta were also used to minimize duration of spinal cord ischemia. Paraplegia occurred in 1 (4.3%; CL 0.2%-17%) of 23 patients with extensive thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. Cambria and colleagues infused 4°C normal saline solution into the epidural space of 70 patients with descending thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms.C1 Simple aortic clamping was used in all but one patient. Two patients (2.9%; CL 0.6%-8%) developed lower-extremity neurologic deficits. In their extended experience with this technique for repairing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, spinal cord ischemic injury (paraplegia or paraparesis) occurred in 11% (CL 8.2%-13; 19 of 180 patients) in whom epidural cooling was used, and in 20% (CL 15%-25%; 18 of 91 patients) in whom it was not used (*P* = .04).B7

**Monitoring Somatosensory and Motor Evoked Potentials** In patients undergoing resection of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, Cunningham and colleagues demonstrated that after occluding the proximal descending thoracic aorta, responses monitored in the cerebral cortex after stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve demonstrated an increased latency and decreased amplitude within 3 to 4 minutes.C23 Responses disappeared after 5 to 10 minutes and returned 8 to 9 minutes after unclamping the aorta. Mizrahi and Crawford demonstrated similar changes within 10 minutes after occluding the aorta in 13 patients and observed rapid reversal of these changes after restoration of flow in the aorta.M9

Although monitoring of somatosensory evoked potentials appears to be a sensitive method to detect spinal cord ischemia and impending paralysis, the technique has several limitations. Because the potentials are conducted through the posterior (sensory) column of the spinal cord and not the anterior (motor) column, ischemia and resulting paraplegia may occur despite recording normal impulses. General anesthetics, changes in temperature, drugs, hypoxia, hypotension, and ischemia of peripheral nerves that occurs following aortic occlusion may affect sensitivity of recorded impulses.C22 Direct stimulation of the spinal cord rather than a peripheral nerve appears to increase sensitivity of the technique.G7,S4

Monitoring somatosensory evoked potentials in patients during operations on the descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta alone or in conjunction with other adjuncts that may reduce the risk of spinal cord ischemic injury (e.g., distal perfusion, hypothermia, CSF drainage, reimplanting intercostal or lumbar arteries) has not consistently reduced the prevalence of paraplegia.C18,C22,C23,G7,G8,S4

Achouh and colleagues have shown that monitoring these potentials is a poor screening tool for development of a neurologic deficit.A2 Among 444 patients undergoing thoracoabdominal or descending thoracic aortic repair, they observed a sensitivity of 62% and a specificity of 81% for the technique. The negative predictive value, however, was 99%, indicating a low event probability in the absence of changes in the evoked potentials.

Monitoring motor evoked potentials may be a more accurate method to detect spinal cord ischemia intraoperatively.D2,L4,S16 Clinical experience with this technique is limited.J1,K7,S3 Monitoring these potentials appears to have a strong negative predictive value for immediate neurologic deficit, similar to that for somatosensory evoked potentials.J1,K7 However, use of the technique has not been shown to substantially reduce or eliminate the occurrence of spinal cord ischemic injury in patients with extensive repairs of the thoracoabdominal aorta, and the positive predictive value is low.J1,K7

**Pharmacologic Interventions** Many pharmacologic agents have been evaluated for their neuroprotective effects in experimental studies of spinal cord ischemia (Box 24-1). Few have been extensively evaluated in humans, however. Thiopental and methylprednisolone are widely used clinically for protection of the brain and spinal cord during operations requiring circulatory arrest and clamping of the descending thoracic aorta.K9 Naloxone has been used in humans in combination with CSF drainage during operations on the thoracoabdominal aorta, and a low prevalence of spinal cord ischemic injury was observed.A1 Intrathecal administration of papaverine, a potent vasodilator, has also been associated with reduced prevalence of paraplegia in a small series of patients.S18

As the pathophysiology of spinal cord ischemic injury is more clearly elucidated, it is likely that pharmacologic

agents will be used more frequently as adjuncts to the other interventions described in the preceding text during thoracic aorta operations that involve interrupting blood flow to the spinal cord.K2,K4,M1

#### *Methods for Perfusing the Distal Aorta during Aortic Clamping*

A wide variety of techniques have been used to perfuse the distal aorta during operations that involve clamping the descending thoracic aorta.

**Left Atrial–to–Femoral Artery Bypass** As the left thoracotomy is being made, with the patient in a right lateral decubitus position and the left leg fully extended, the left common femoral artery is exposed. After thoracotomy and before addressing the aortic pathology, the pericardium is opened anterior to the phrenic nerve. A purse-string suture is placed around the base of the left atrial appendage. After a full dose of heparin, or after a reduced dose of 100 to 150 units · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (1-1.5 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), or after no heparinization,H1,O1 a standard femoral arterial cannula (see "Cardiopulmonary Bypass Established by Peripheral Cannulation" in Section III of Chapter 2) is inserted into the femoral artery (or an aortic cannula can be inserted into the distal descending thoracic aorta) and a 28F, 30F, or 32F venous cannula is inserted into the left atrium through the appendage. Alternatively, a 28F cannula, which is usually sufficiently large, can be inserted into the left inferior pulmonary vein extrapericardially.C5 The cannulae are connected to each other through a vortex pump (see "Temporary Ventricular Assistance" in Section I of Chapter 5) using standard or heparin-coated tubing. Bypass is then commenced at a flow of about 1.5 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> (in adults). During bypass, mean pulmonary artery pressure should be maintained above 18 to 20 mmHg to avoid pumping excessive blood from the atrium to the distal aorta, which may result in inadequate perfusion of the proximal aorta and hypotension. Blood volume must also be maintained at appropriate levels by infusing blood and fluids to avoid hypotension.

Decannulation is effected as soon as the aortic clamps are removed. If heparin was used, protamine is administered in an appropriate dose (see "Completing Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2).

Left atrial–to–femoral artery bypass has been shown to provide better postoperative lower-body organ function than passive shunts,C5,O1 and there is increasing evidence that when carefully implemented, it is associated with a lower prevalence of spinal cord ischemic injury and renal dysfunction than when distal perfusion is not used, particularly when aortic occlusion time exceeds 40 minutesB10,J2,L5,S14 (Fig. 24-12). Maintaining distal perfusion with this technique also reduces need for vasodilating agents during aortic clamping and reduces prevalence of hypotension and acidosis after unclamping.S1

**Aortic-Aortic Shunting** Aortic-aortic shunting is a passive process (unless a pump is interposedD6) in which arterial pressure above the aortic clamp drives blood through the shunt into the distal aorta. A full or half dose of heparin may be given, or none at all. A 9-mm Gott heparin-bonded shunt may be used,G6 or a simple shunt constructed from standard perfusion tubing and cannulae. Proximally, the shunt is inserted through a purse-string suture into the aortic arch or ascending aorta (which can at times be difficult), or into the apex of the left ventricle. The distal end of the shunt is similarly inserted into the descending thoracic aorta. Alternatively, the shunt may be extended and connected to a cannula placed in the femoral artery. The shunt is opened as soon as the aorta is clamped. Flow through the shunt should be monitored, either with a flow probe incorporated into the shunt or by measuring arterial pressure distal to the lower aortic clamp.V2 After removing the aortic clamps, decannulation is effected in a standard manner, and protamine may be given if heparin has been administered.

Hemodynamic state during aortic clamping and lowerbody organ function postoperatively are better with this method (and with left atrial to femoral artery bypass) than with simple aortic clamping.C4,C5,K10 Flows between 1100 and 4900 mL · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (mean 2500 mL · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) have been measured in patients having resection of descending thoracic aorta aneurysms.V2 Shunt flow is dependent on proximal aortic pressure and resistance in the arterial compartment distal to the lower aortic clamp. Reducing pressure in the proximal aorta with nitroprusside may be necessary to avoid cardiac failure. A zero prevalence of lower-extremity neurologic deficits (0%; CL 0%-0.5%) has been reported by Verdant and colleagues, who used this technique in 366 patients with aneurysms confined to the descending thoracic aorta.V2

thoracoabdominal incision can be established effectively in most patients using the femoral artery and vein (see "Cardio-pulmonary Bypass Established by Peripheral Cannulation" in Section III of Chapter 2). C4,C17,K6,P4 Special long catheters are required for adequate venous drainage (Fig. 24-13). The tip of such a catheter can be positioned accurately in the midright atrium using TEE.

When CPB is conducted at normothermia or mild hypothermia (>32°C), the heart continues to beat, so some pulmonary blood flow continues and CPB is only partial for the upper body. For the lower body, supplied by that part of the aorta distal to the lower aortic clamp, CPB is complete. A pulmonary arterial pressure monitoring catheter should be in place, and if left heart decompression is inadequate, a venting catheter can be placed in the pulmonary artery or left inferior pulmonary vein. When conducted at hypothermia, either as continuous perfusion or in preparation for hypothermic circulatory arrest, CPB is usually total because the heart becomes ineffective as lowering of body temperature proceeds.

Aortic clamp time (minutes)

Use of hypothermic circulatory arrest for aortic surgery using a lateral approach began in 1964 and was used only sporadically during the next 20 years. B11,B15,C17,D9,L7,M3,M6 High prevalence of pulmonary complications was reported by Crawford and colleagues in 1987. With increasing experience, prevalence of pulmonary and other major complications has been reduced. F4,K9,K11

Currently available information indicates that this technique has an important place in aortic surgery, particularly when extensive operations are required and when clamping of the proximal descending thoracic aorta cannot be safely accomplished. C17,F4,K9,K12,K13 It is of particular value in patients who require resection of the entire descending thoracic and most or all of the abdominal aorta. The combination of CPB, using femoral cannulation, hypothermic circulatory arrest, implanting patent lower intercostal and upper lumbar arteries into the graft, and early insertion of a second arterial cannula into the graft after the proximal anastomosis has been

completed allows perfusion of the heart and head vessels as the more distal parts of operation are being completedK9,K12,K13 (see Fig. 26-19 in Chapter 26).

#### Grafts for Use in Aortic Surgery

#### *Type*

Through the years, PTFE and polyester grafts (knitted or woven and of various weaves), autologous and bovine pericardium, and allograft aorta and pulmonary trunk have been used to augment or replace a portion of the systemic or pulmonary arterial pathway. Although this discussion will focus on grafts for aortic replacement, it is relevant to pulmonary arterial replacement and to patches used in these locations and inside the ventricles and atria.

Issues related to graft type include ease of handling, compliance, durability, hemostatic properties, and thickness and adherence of the neointima that develops. Autologous pericardium, either untreated or immersed in 0.6% glutaraldehyde for 5 to 30 minutes (the advantages of which remain arguable), is easy to handle and suture. It is compliant, durable (although sometimes given to stretching or contracting), and impervious to blood. It is extremely useful as a patch graft. Tube grafts fashioned from pericardium are no longer used for aortic replacement. In neonates and young infants, allograft aorta is ideal for augmenting the aorta, as is allograft pulmonary artery; both are useful as extracardiac conduits to the pulmonary arteries. They are also used in the sinutubular portion of the ascending aorta. The wall of the aortic allograft calcifies (pulmonary allograft wall does so to a lesser degree), but it functions well for a number of years (see "Isolated Aortic Valve Replacement" and "Replacement of Aortic Valve and Ascending Aorta, En Bloc" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 12 as well as Technique of Operation in Section II of Chapter 38).

Intracardiac patches need not be impervious to blood immediately after insertion, and thus the Sauvage knitted polyester patch (see Chapter 35, footnote 4) works well.

Contoured patches are more conveniently cut from tube grafts, and double-velour woven polyester grafts (see later) are easily handled, compliant, and durable. They may be backed by pericardium (autologous or bovine) if the patch is large and must be immediately hemostatic. PTFE is entirely satisfactory for patches and small tube grafts, and is generally impervious to blood. However, it is susceptible to kinking, and bleeding through suture holes may be persistent.

When a patch or tube graft forms part of the wall of a blood vessel or the heart in a heparinized patient, demands for hemostasis are stringent. A number of solutions to this problem have become available. Knitted polyester grafts with a baseline water permeability of about 2000 mL · cm<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> have enjoyed favor in the past because of ease of handling and development of a thinner and more adherent neointima after insertion than is the case with woven grafts.B2,J5,J6 In heparinized patients, untreated knitted polyester grafts, which permit massive hemorrhage through the graft, are unsuitable for use for any external vascular surface. Newer types of woven polyester grafts are as soft and easy to handle and sew as knitted grafts and are more impervious to blood. Bovine pericardium is an excellent patch material for the aorta, major systemic arteries, and the pulmonary artery. Its handling characteristics and ready availability make it an optimal substitute. It can also be used as a tube graft in the pulmonary arterial circulation.

#### *Preclotting of Synthetic Grafts*

A number of useful methods of preclotting grafts can be used in heparinized patients. In one, preclotting is obtained by aspirating about 50 mL of the nonheparinized patient's blood from the heart or aorta, clamping one end of the graft and stretching it and injecting the blood into the other end under as high a pressure as can be generated. As the blood exudes from the graft, it is collected in a small pan, and after the first injection is completed, the blood is reaspirated from the pan and again injected under high pressure. This process is continued until most of the blood has clotted. Before the graft is inserted, the clots are aspirated or wiped from the interior (not rinsed out with saline solution), and the device is ready for use.

A second method involves autoclaving the graft.C12,T2 The general technique of autoclaving as part of the preclotting process was suggested by Bethea and Reemtsma, who soaked grafts in heparinized whole blood before autoclaving.B6 Alternatively, 5% albumin, concentrated serum albumin, plasma, or platelet-rich plasma can be applied to the graft prior to autoclaving.

Various preclotting techniques affect inner-surface thrombogenicity of polyester grafts and their tendency toward thromboembolism. According to experimental studies in dogs by Gloviczki and colleagues, with low-porosity polyester woven grafts, the area of desirable thrombus-free surface was greatest when the graft was not preclotted or when it was preclotted with blood in the standard manner.G5 Among autoclaved grafts, those soaked with platelet-rich plasma rather than blood had the most thrombus-free surface, and this was correlated with the lowest prevalence of thromboembolism. Albumin alone and platelet-free plasma were not tested.

#### *Grafts Treated Before Packaging*

The convenience of grafts that are ready for insertion without further treatment after removal from the package is evident.K1 Woven and knitted grafts impregnated with albumin, collagen, or gelatin are now commercially available. In experimental and clinical studies, these grafts demonstrate less transinterstitial bleeding than preclotted grafts. Woven grafts appear to be preferable to knitted grafts in fully heparinized patients who require replacement of segments of the thoracic aorta.

#### *Endografts*

The initial thoracic endovascular stent-grafts used clinically were hand-made from polyester or PTFE aortic grafts covered with modified Z stents.K3 Several commercially manufactured endografts approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating descending thoracic aortic aneurysms are currently available. They have undergone numerous modifications in construction as clinical experience has increased. The currently available grafts are constructed from self-expanding nitinol or stainless steel stents that are sutured to the outer surface of thin PTFE or polyester grafts. They are available in various diameters and lengths and incorporate different systems for anchoring the grafts to the aortic wall. Long-term durability of these grafts is unknown.
