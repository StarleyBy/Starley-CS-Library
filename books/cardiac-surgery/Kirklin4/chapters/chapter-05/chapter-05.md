The primary determinants of a cardiac operation's success are events in the operating room (OR), but even patients who are seriously ill when they leave the OR can survive and have a good long-term result when postoperative care is appropriate and intensive. Conversely, ill-advised or overly energetic interventions early after operation can put a patient at risk who would otherwise convalesce normally.

Normal convalescence is not normal physiology. For instance, care early after open intracardiac operations is complicated by the whole body inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Currently, the major issue relating to abnormalities of postoperative convalescence is the degree of preoperative morbidity in terms of both circulatory derangements and comorbid subsystem abnormalities. Failure to realize that a patient undergoing CPB is, for a time afterward, in a special biological situation to which the knowledge and rules applicable to other humans may or may not apply can lead to conceptual and management errors as well as unnecessary tests and interventions.

Fortunately, despite these problems and thanks to expanding knowledge, postoperative care can and should be simple for many patients undergoing cardiac operations. A normal, uncomplicated convalescence devoid of findings or events that increase the probability of hospital death, complications, or a suboptimal late result is what patients can now expect. Generally, they have adequate function of all subsystems, as determined by standard criteria. So long as this pattern of normal convalescence continues, testing and intervention can be safely minimized. In these situations, expeditious discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU) can be accomplished and a short subsequent hospital stay anticipated.

But alertness to deviations from the pattern of an uncomplicated convalescence is mandatory; deviations are an indication for closer observation and possibly more intensive testing and treatment. Analysis of early convalescence can place the patient into one of three categories: optimal, suboptimal but in control, and critically ill. Each category carries therapeutic implications.

- Optimal: routine care; no change or important modification is currently necessary or foreseeable.
- Suboptimal but in control: careful consideration is given to a change in therapy, and a new modality is likely (e.g., additional catecholamine support for low cardiac output

- or lidocaine drip for frequent premature ventricular contractions [PVCs]).
- Critically ill: a modification, change, or new intervention is necessary and urgent (e.g., treatment of oliguria or metabolic acidosis; return to the OR for bleeding).

Both the *suboptimal* and *critically ill* categories define abnormal convalescence.

The patient convalescing normally and without complications after cardiac surgery usually appears at a glance to be doing well. Although there is always pain, varying in intensity from patient to patient, there is no restlessness, agitation, or anxiety. Eyes and skin look normal, and the pulse is full but may be rapid. Breathing is neither labored nor excessively rapid. The patient is oriented and lucid and—whether a neonate, infant, or adult—exhibits generally appropriate behavior. Few tests and interventions are needed.

When convalescence is abnormal, observations and interventions must be intensive and at times complex. In these situations in particular, care must be well organized and follow specific patient-management protocols that allow all members of the intensive care team to be clear about details of management.

Use of protocols is facilitated by considering the patient to be a complex, integrated system composed of a number of separate but interrelated subsystems (i.e., cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, nervous, gastrointestinal). Care of such a patient can be accomplished effectively using a "subsystems analysis" approach.K19 This analysis begins in the OR as CPB is discontinued (see Chapters 2 and 4) and continues into the early and late postoperative period. This is not to say that care can be carried out in an automatic fashion. Optimal postoperative care requires overall direction by a knowledgeable and experienced physician using, when indicated, specialized methods of securing information and the skills of personnel in a dedicated cardiovascular ICU.

Management of patients after cardiac surgery has become in some institutions a specialty of its own. Literature on the subject abounds. Around the world, numerous institutions with extensive experience in the surgery of both congenital and acquired heart disease have developed their own protocols and specific systems of management. These include "fast track" protocols and critical pathways that integrate the goals of all caregivers and other interested parties. Within the context of these developments, this chapter discusses general principles, along with enough specific details to be helpful to those desiring to change or develop their own protocols.

# **Section I Subsystems during Early Convalescence after Cardiac Surgery**

# CARDIOVASCULAR SUBSYSTEM

# Cardiac Reserve

Cardiac reserve is the capacity to increase (or at least maintain) cardiac output as a response to a variety of stressful sudden developments, including increased total body oxygen 1

consumption (V O2), increased ventricular afterload, and decreased ventricular preload. Providing that capacity are all the cardiac and extracardiac mechanisms for maintaining and increasing the force of ventricular contraction and cardiac output. Most of these reside in myocardial contractility and coronary blood flow.1 In patients convalescing from cardiac surgery, adequacy of cardiac performance alone is insufficient for a high probability of normal convalescence and survival. There must, in addition, be adequacy of cardiac reserve.

Inadequacy of cardiac reserve may become apparent only during periods of increased V O2 (from struggling or hyperthermia), suddenly increased ventricular afterload (from paroxysmal pulmonary arterial hypertension in a neonate), or acute reduction in ventricular preload (from sudden blood loss). Such inadequacies of cardiac reserve probably explain "sudden death" occurring early after cardiac surgery.

Cardiac reserve is highly dependent on the preoperative condition of the patient. When, because of disease, reserves are being nearly fully utilized to maintain adequate cardiac performance in nonstressful situations, that which remains may be insufficient to successfully meet the stresses of the intraoperative and postoperative period. Reserves probably cannot be increased before the operation unless they are acutely impaired by a reduced myocardial energy charge.A17 Energy charge may be increased by the cardioplegic technique used in the OR (see "Cold Cardioplegia, Controlled Aortic Root Reperfusion, and [When Needed] Warm Cardioplegic Induction" under Methods of Myocardial Management during Cardiac Surgery in Chapter 3).

Limited cardiac reserves are specifically compensated for by many features of early postoperative care.

#### Adequacy

Although not often conceptualized and not specifically measurable, adequacy of blood flow (cardiac output) in meeting the patient's needs during recovery from cardiac surgery is the central issue with respect to the cardiovascular subsystem. Arteries and veins are infrequently the primary limiting factors, so emphasis is on adequacy of performance of the heart itself in providing adequate blood flow to the body.

#### *Cardiac Index*

Cardiac index (cardiac output expressed as L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ) is one measure of adequacy of the cardiovascular subsystem, as evidenced by the oft-demonstrated relation between cardiac index and survival (described by Dietzman and colleagues in 1969D13). In adults, a cardiac index of at least 2.0 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> during the first few hours in the ICU and one of at least 2.4 on the morning after operation are required for normal convalescence (Fig. 5-1). This is at the lower end of the range of normal, which is 2.2 to 4.4.B2 Infants and small children appear, in general, to require a somewhat higher cardiac index for normal convalescence (Fig. 5-2). Also, in young patients, cardiac index tends to be lower about 4 hours after operation than it was soon after discontinuing CPB, and then begins to rise after 9 to 12 hours.M12

Cardiac indices below these values are usually inadequate for maintaining a normal convalescence; this can be formalized in the inverse relation between cardiac index early

The familiar exercise stress test is a test for cardiac reserve.

**Figure 5-2** Relationship of early postoperative cardiac index (average of all early postoperative values) to probability of cardiac death in infants and small children.

postoperatively and the probability of hospital death. This relation can be refined by considering not only cardiac output but also mixed venous oxygen levels, with lower levels worsening prognosis at any given value of cardiac output.<sup>2</sup>

#### Arterial Blood Pressure

Arterial blood pressure is an insensitive method of estimating adequacy of cardiac output early postoperatively, primarily because systemic vascular resistance (Rs) is usually elevated. E12

Data from Nadas and Fyler.<sup>N1</sup>

"Mean arterial blood pressure has been calculated as the diastolic pressure plus one third of the pulse pressure.

This may be related to increased levels of circulating catecholamines, W4 plasma renin, R10 angiotensin II, or other mechanisms. This high resistance may result in a normal or high arterial blood pressure even when cardiac output is low.

Some patients tend early postoperatively to have low Rs and arterial blood pressure, even when cardiac performance is good. This may occur more frequently in children with cyanotic heart disease, adults with diabetes, and patients with sepsis or drug interactions (especially preoperative use of angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors). C3,M20 Arterial hypotension is an indication for thoughtful evaluation. Children cannot be considered to be convalescing normally when mean arterial blood pressure is lower than about 10% below normal for the patient's age (Table 5-1). For adults, particularly the elderly, arterial blood pressure may mandate maintenance at or above commonly accepted normal values to ensure adequate perfusion of various organs like the brain, viscera, and kidneys.

#### Pedal Pulses

Simple observation of pedal pulses is a commonly used, useful, but not infallible method of estimating adequacy of cardiac output in children and young adults. Normal (grade 4) pedal pulses early postoperatively are highly but not perfectly correlated with adequate cardiac output and a high probability of survival. K15,K16 In older adults, estimation of the adequacy of perfusion by amplitude of pedal pulses is often confounded by the presence of peripheral arterial occlusive disease.

#### Skin Temperature

Skin temperature in the foot is another indirect but reasonably reliable estimator of adequacy of cardiac output. A study of cardiac surgery in infants younger than 3 months of age indicated that pedal pulses and skin temperature predicted probability of hospital death from cardiac causes and thus were reasonably good estimators of adequacy of cardiac output. K15 As with assessment of pedal pulse amplitude, in older adults skin temperature offers guidance but not solid evidence for adequacy of perfusion.

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>2</sup>Although dye dilution or thermodilution is the standard for measuring cardiac output, caution is required in interpreting measurement values. In small individuals, confidence intervals around the measurement may be large; low core temperature may diminish accuracy; and tricuspid regurgitation, absence of an adequate mixing chamber, lack of steady state, and intracardiac shunts (as originally articulated by Stewart and Hamilton H2,835) invalidate the measurement.

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>b</sup>40 mmHg in infants <1 month of age.

### Whole Body Oxygen Consumption

Whole body  $\dot{V}_{O_2}$  is infrequently calculated, but knowledge of it is useful; in some circumstances, it is a better basis for prognostic and therapeutic inferences than cardiac output or mixed venous oxygen levels. Whole body  $\dot{V}_{O_2}$  can be calculated by a rearranged Fick equation,<sup>3</sup> which states:

$$\dot{V}_{O_2} \left( mL \cdot min^{-1} \cdot m^{-2} \right) = \dot{Q} \cdot \left( CaO_2 - C\overline{v}O_2 \right) \tag{5-1}$$

The normal value for  $\dot{V}_{O_2}$  at 37°C is 155 mL · min<sup>-1</sup> · m<sup>-2</sup>. The value for whole body  $\dot{V}_{O_2}$  in the patient recovering from cardiac surgery must be interpreted in light of his or her body temperature; residual hypothermia is the most common explanation for the somewhat low  $\dot{V}_{O_2}$  usually present within the first few hours after open heart surgery. This reduced  $\dot{V}_{O_2}$  is in part due to reduced capillary density (reduced area of capillary flow) and increased heterogeneity of capillary flow through the muscle mass and other tissues of the body in the early hours after CPB. Bromally convalescing patients operated on with hypothermic CPB generally require 4 to 8 hours for this to disappear and their peripheral perfusion to return to normal. Krap

When  $\dot{V}_{O_2}$  is appreciably reduced below the normal level for the existing body temperature, a hazardous condition exists; indeed, one useful definition of shock is "a condition characterized by an acute reduction in  $\dot{V}_{O_2}$ ." Abnormally low  $\dot{V}_{O_2}$  may result from reduction or extreme heterogeneity of capillary flow (of which "no reflow" is an extreme example) in one or more organs of the body (sometimes termed a reduction in capillary density), lengthening of the diffusion path between capillaries and cells, or intracellular metabolic derangement. One or all of these may exist in patients early after cardiac surgery. When important reduction in  $\dot{V}_{O_2}$ , considering the temperature, persists for more than a few hours, probability of death increases.

#### Mixed Venous Oxygen Level

Mixed venous oxygen level, generally expressed as oxygen tension  $(P\overline{\nu}o_2)$  or saturation  $(S\overline{\nu}o_2)$ , is a useful index of circulatory adequacy, because it reflects to some extent mean

$$\dot{Q} = \frac{\dot{V}_{O_2}}{Ca_{O_2} - C\overline{v}_{O_2}} (L \times min^{-1})$$
 (5-2)

where  $\dot{Q}$  is cardiac output in L · min<sup>-1</sup>,  $\dot{V}o_2$  is oxygen consumption in mL · min<sup>-1</sup>,  $\dot{C}ao_2$  is arterial  $O_2$  content in mL · L<sup>-1</sup>, and  $C\overline{\nu}o_2$  is mixed venous  $O_2$  content in mL · L<sup>-1</sup>.

The oxygen content of blood consists of combined plus dissolved oxygen:

$$Co_2 = \frac{1.38 \cdot Hb \cdot So_2}{100} + 0.03 \cdot Po_2(mL \cdot L^{-1})$$
 (5-3)

where Hb is hemoglobin concentration in  $g \cdot L^{-1}$ ,  $So_2$  is  $O_2$  saturation as a percentage of capacity,  $Po_2$  is  $O_2$  tension in mmHg, I.38 is effective  $O_2$  capacity of 1 g of hemoglobin in mL  $\cdot$  g<sup>-1</sup>, and 0.03 is solubility of  $O_2$  in blood at 37°C in mL  $\cdot$  L<sup>-1</sup>  $\cdot$  mmHg<sup>-1</sup>.

Rearranging equation 5-2 and substituting for CaO<sub>2</sub> from equation 5-3,

$$C\overline{v}o_2 = \frac{1.38 \cdot Hb \cdot Sao_2}{100} + 0.03 \cdot Pao_2 - \frac{\dot{V}o_2}{\dot{Q}}$$
 (5-4)

where  $SaO_2$  is arterial  $O_2$  saturation as a percentage of capacity, and  $PaO_2$  is arterial  $O_2$  tension in mmHg.

For a given  $\dot{V}_{O_2}$ , equation 5-4 indicates that to increase  $C\bar{v}_{O_2}$ , there must be an increase in SaO<sub>2</sub>, PaO<sub>2</sub>, Hb, or  $\dot{Q}$ .  $C\bar{v}_{O_2}$  varies directly with  $P\bar{v}_{O_2}$ , and  $P\bar{v}_{O_2}$  varies directly with cellular  $PO_2$ , unless there is shunting in the peripheral circulation. Thus, to maximize tissue oxygen supply, there must be an increase of one or more of the following:  $PaO_2$  (and thus SaO<sub>2</sub>), Hb, or  $\dot{Q}$ .

tissue oxygen levels. K20 When  $P\overline{\nu}O_2$  is less than 30 mmHg, cardiac output is likely to be inadequate; when it is below about 23 mmHg, the inadequacy is apt to be severe (Fig. 5-3). However, normal or near-normal venous oxygen levels are not reassuring as to the adequacy of cardiac output, unless it is known that  $\dot{V}O_2$  is approximately normal for the existing body temperature.

In a nonsurgical but critically ill ICU population, Jain and colleagues<sup>J3</sup> found a weak relationship between Svo<sub>2</sub> and cardiac index. There was considerable variability among all patients in various conditions, but when normalized for  $\dot{V}_{O_2}$ and hemoglobin concentration, the correlation coefficient improved (Fig. 5-4). Using indwelling fiberoptic reflectance oximetry, 14 other investigators have found no or only a very weak relationship between  $S\overline{v}o_2$  or  $P\overline{v}o_2$  and measured cardiac index. M3,V2 Following CPB, changes in  $S\overline{v}o_2$  may be useful in detecting low cardiac output, one of many causes of decreased oxygen delivery. Identifying decreases may be of particular value in patients coming to surgery with a high severity of illness index. Online continuous oximetry is useful in critically ill patients because it reflects unanticipated events or occasionally the usefulness (or nonusefulness) of therapeutic maneuvers. S29 These aspects of postoperative care illustrate the need for uniformity in monitoring techniques and highlight the conflict between overreliance on devices and the ability to form accurate estimates (in this case, of cardiac performance) based on previous correlations. S29 However, many surgeons rely on continuous Svo2 monitoring to detect deviations from normal convalescence early postoperatively. Catheters that allow measurement of both  $S\overline{v}o_2$  and cardiac output are optimal.

#### Urine Flow and Serum Potassium

Urine flow and serum potassium levels are useful indirect guides to the adequacy of cardiac output. Early postoperative

Figure 5-4 Relationship between mixed venous oxygen saturation and cardiac index in 30 patients with advanced heart failure. *Top panel,* Solid line represents best fit of the Fick equation to all measured data points (N). *Center panel,* Measured cardiac index normalized by calculated oxygen consumption ( $\dot{V}o_2c$ ). *Bottom panel,* Measured cardiac index normalized for hemoglobin (Hb) and  $\dot{V}o_2c$ . A nonlinear relationship was observed between mixed venous oxygen saturation and cardiac index (correlation coefficient 0.52). On normalizing for differences in hemoglobin and oxygen consumption, the correlation coefficient became 0.90. Thus, the relationship between mixed venous oxygen saturation and cardiac index in a group of patients depends on the homogeneity of their hemoglobin and oxygen consumption. Furthermore, the ability of mixed venous oxygen saturation to serve as a therapeutic indicator in any given patient depends on baseline saturation and cardiac index. (From Jain and colleagues.)<sup>3</sup>)

oliguria suggests inadequate cardiac output and thus is often an indication for treatment of the cardiovascular subsystem. Hyperkalemia rising over a 4-hour period (with sampling every 2 hours) to a level of about 5 mEq  $\cdot$  L<sup>-1</sup> is a sensitive indicator of a low or falling cardiac output in neonates and infants, and hence an indication for intensifying treatment. Hyperkalemia is usually accompanied by a fall in pedal skin temperature and a rise in esophageal temperature, but it often precedes the appearance of a base deficit or of arterial hypotension.

#### Metabolic Acidosis

A frequently used but somewhat nonspecific and insensitive indicator of the adequacy of cardiac output is the acid-base status of blood. Metabolic acidosis during and after cardiac surgery is almost always a result of lactic acidemia. Lactate production is a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism, which most often occurs under conditions in which cardiac output and oxygen consumption are suboptimal. Occasionally, excess lactate may occur with high measured cardiac output under conditions of high metabolic rate, diabetes, sepsis, or intestinal ischemia.

Concentration of lactic acid in blood may be measured directly. Normally, little or none is present, normal values in plasma being 0.7 to 2.1 mEq  $\cdot$   $L^{-1}$ . A concentration of about 5 mEq  $\cdot$   $L^{-1}$  correlates in general with moderate metabolic acidosis, and one of 10 mEq  $\cdot$   $L^{-1}$  with severe metabolic acidosis and usually markedly reduced cardiac output. Moderate elevation of lactic acid concentration is a common finding early after cardiac surgery, but in the normally convalescing patient, lactic acid gradually declines to normal values within 12 to 24 hours.

When arterial pH is less than about 7.4, acidosis is present but may be the result of retention of carbon dioxide; this is reflected in an arterial PaCO<sub>2</sub> greater than 40 mmHg. Alternatively, acidosis may be "metabolic" and due primarily to accumulation of lactic acid. Quantification of metabolic acidosis is expressed by a derived value obtained from an equation after measuring arterial pH and PaCO<sub>2</sub>. S21 Either the buffer base deficit or the standard bicarbonate is calculated. Most commercially available equipment calculates the buffer base deficit or excess (which takes account of the buffering capacity of blood as well as that of bicarbonate) after measuring PaO<sub>2</sub>, PaCO<sub>2</sub>, and pH of whole blood. The

normal buffer base is about 48 mEq  $\cdot$  L<sup>-1</sup>, and the normal base excess or deficit is 0.

# Cardiac Output and Its Determinants

The cardiac index in normally convalescing adults is often 2.5 to 3.5 L  $\cdot$  min $^{-1}$  · m $^{-2}$  after cardiac surgery performed with modern methods of myocardial management. It is generally higher 4 to 6 hours after operation than it is in the OR and still higher the next day, although exceptions occur. Even in patients who convalesce well, some variability in cardiac output occurs.

Risk factors for low cardiac output seem primarily to be those that affect cardiac output in the OR, which in turn is strongly correlated with cardiac output 4 to 6 hours later and the next day. F9 Cardiac output after operations using CPB is usually correlated with age of the patient (older patients have lower output), cardiac condition, functional state of the patient just before operation (the higher the New York Heart Association [NYHA] class, the lower the output), duration of CPB, and duration of global myocardial ischemia. During the early postoperative period, a heart rate within usual ranges correlates directly with cardiac output, and arterial blood pressure within usual ranges correlates inversely with it. All Within the usual ranges, the higher the atrial pressures, the higher the cardiac output (Fig. 5-5).

Determinants of cardiac output are ventricular preload, afterload, myocardial contractility, and heart rate. Most normally convalescing patients require no special measures to adjust these fundamental determinants; patients with impaired or inadequate cardiac performance require at least adjustment of preload and afterload, and at times adjustment of heart rate and/or pharmacologic or interventional augmentation of contractility. In many patients who have undergone cardiac

Mean arterial pressure is depicted as a continuous variable along the horizontal axis, and mean atrial pressure (the higher of the two) is represented by isobars. Note that in general, the lower the arterial pressure, the higher the cardiac index; and the higher the atrial pressure, the higher the cardiac index.

surgery, it is specifically either the left (LV) or the right ventricle (RV) that limits cardiac output, less commonly both (see "Relative Performance of Left and Right Ventricles" later in this section).

#### Ventricular Preload

Ventricular preload, which is correlated directly with the force of contraction, is equated with sarcomere length at end-diastole, and thus with change in ventricular volume between end-systole and end-diastole. This volume change is determined by transmural pressure during diastole, compliance and thickness of the ventricular wall, and curvature of the wall (La Place effect). Transmural geometric arrangement of fibers also plays a role but changes little during the postoperative period.

Transmural pressure is determined by intraventricular pressure and intrapericardial pressure. Intraventricular pressure at end-diastole (which is a determinant of the force of contraction) is related to phasic changes in atrial pressure, and these are affected by blood volume and systemic venous capacitance. The latter is decreased early after CPB. R7 Because transmural pressure is affected by intrapericardial pressure, it is affected by closure of the pericardium and sternum, both of which increase intrapericardial pressure and decrease transmural pressure. Daughters and colleagues<sup>D3</sup> have demonstrated that pericardial closure in the setting of cardiac surgery, both itself and independent of sternal closure, increases intrapericardial pressure, decreases transmural pressure, and unfavorably affects cardiac performance. Changes in myocardial compliance during and after cardiac operations are due primarily to changes in myocardial water content.

After cardiac surgery in patients with normal atrioventricular (AV) valves, most acute changes in preload are equated with acute changes in mean left (in the case of the LV) or right (in the case of the RV) atrial pressure. This is because in this setting, and when the atria are functioning normally as reservoirs, P9 ventricular end-diastolic pressure is similar to the mean pressure in the corresponding atrium. Therefore, mean atrial pressure is measured in cardiac surgical patients to deduce ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Right atrial pressure is usually measured using a fine polyvinyl catheter introduced through the right atrial appendage or internal jugular vein. Left atrial pressure is measured through a fine catheter introduced through the right superior pulmonary vein (or the left atrial appendage in neonates and young infants). In the absence of pulmonary vascular disease and important pulmonary congestion or edema, pulmonary artery diastolic pressure is a reasonable approximation of left atrial pressure. In most adult patients following CPB, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure exceeds left atrial pressure, and this discrepancy increases through the twelfth postoperative hour. It is thought this difference is due to accumulation of interstitial lung water<sup>M4</sup> (Fig. 5-6).

#### Ventricular Afterload

In the intact ventricle, *afterload* is defined as systolic wall stress. This is the analog of the load that resists shortening in the isolated papillary muscle. Other things being equal, increased afterload results in decreased stroke volume. In the intact ventricle, afterload is related to (1) ventricular transmural pressure during systole, (2) ventricular wall curvature as determined by ventricular volume (La Place effect), (3) ventricular wall thickness, and (4) shape of the ventricle.

![](_page_7_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 5-6** Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure *(PCWP)* compared with left atrial pressure *(LAP)* expressed as mean ± standard error *(SEM)*. In 20 consecutive patients, PCWP exceeded LAP in the early postbypass period and was most significantly increased at 4, 8, and 12 hours after operation. These data suggest the LAP more accurately reflects left ventricular filling and is more accurate than PCWP to monitor hemodynamics postoperatively. (From Mammana and colleagues.M4)

Ventricular wall determinants of afterload change little during and early after operations. Instead, acute changes in afterloads of the LV and RV are usually produced by changes in intraventricular pressures during systole. These changes are equated with changes in proximal aortic and pulmonary arterial systolic pressures. During and early after operation, proximal pulmonary arterial pressures may be monitored directly, but proximal aortic pressures are not. They must be inferred from measured radial (or femoral) artery pressures. Because of the many determinants of the magnitude of systolic amplification, systolic blood pressure at the radial artery is usually higher than in the ascending aorta, except in the situation of peripheral vasoconstriction secondary to low cardiac output or high-dose α-adrenergic agents. In most instances, systolic pressure variability between the aorta and peripheral arteries is not clinically important, but an awareness of it is advantageous in some situations. Mean pressures are similar in the two areas.

A tendency toward arterial hypertension is present in many adult patients early postoperatively, related to increased systemic arteriolar resistance.G2 This complication (1) increases ventricular afterload and thereby decreases stroke volume, (2) increases aortic wall tension and thereby increases the likelihood of tearing the aortic purse-string sutures and suture lines, and (3) increases LV metabolic demands that exacerbate any latent myocardial ischemia.F13 An appropriate criterion for treatment to lower arterial blood pressure in this setting is a mean arterial blood pressure 10% above the normal value. Mean arterial blood pressure, *not* systolic pressure, is monitored for this purpose because of the interrelations between peripheral and central arterial pressures discussed earlier. However, the patient's preoperative blood pressure must be taken into account, and to avoid cerebral complications, markedly hypertensive patients must not be rendered hypotensive. In the ICU, sodium nitroprusside is generally used for this purpose (see Appendix 5A), but nitroglycerin may be preferred when myocardial ischemia is present, because it decreases coronary resistance. Negative intrathoracic pressure also increases LV load resisting shortening by increasing LV transmural pressure. Positive-pressure ventilation negates this effect, but labored spontaneous ventilation may augment afterload, and this may decrease cardiac output.P17,R11

# *Myocardial Contractility*

When a change in stroke volume cannot be explained by a change in end-diastolic fiber length (preload) or load resisting shortening (afterload), it is considered to result from a change in the contractile state. Contractility in a given ventricle can be acutely depressed or increased. When an attempt is made to compare ventricular contractility from patient to patient, and from time to time in the same patient, problems arise. A papillary muscle that is twice as thick as others might appear to have twice the contractility when studied in the usual way. In the ventricle, and at least theoretically in papillary muscle, data interpreted in terms of contractility must be normalized according to muscle thickness and length.

In vivo assessment of myocardial contractility and the resultant quantification of ventricular pump function are desirable goals postoperatively. The simplest representation of the capacity of the heart as a pump is a determination of any of several modifications of the Frank-Starling mechanism. For instance, the measured change in cardiac output (or stroke volume) with aliquot infusions of blood or blood substitute serves as a surrogate for assessment of contractile function. Clearly this is not reflective of intrinsic contractile properties of the myocardium, because the pressure-volume relationship is affected not only by preload but also by load resisting shortening, myocardial compliance, and intact vagal and sympathetic reflex activity. Changes in the instantaneous ventricular pressure (or aortic pressure) over time, dp/dt, may reflect myocardial contractility, but this quantity is exquisitely sensitive to afterload and preload and cannot be assumed to be an index of contractility that can be transferred from one patient to another or within the same patient over a period of time.

The relationship between ventricular pressure and volume (pressure-volume loop) is currently the nearest approximation to an in vivo assessment of contractility.S41 Additionally, the area within the loop represents stroke work. The endsystolic pressure and the pressure at end-diastole of several different loops allow an expression of contractility and stiffness, respectively. The loops are composed of four segments: isovolumic contraction, ejection, isovolumic relaxation, and filling (Fig. 5-7). When ventricular volume or resistance is altered, a group of points at end-systole fall along a line, the slope of which Suga and colleagues called *Emax*. S41,S42 Emax is an index of contractility (Fig. 5-8). Changes of the slope in a steeper direction reflect increased inotropy. A shift in the rightward direction represents negative inotropy. With the use of catheters to measure LV pressure and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for instantaneous border detection, pressure-volume loops and Emax (contractility at zero volume) can be interpreted online in the ICU. It is paradoxical that the least clearly and directly defined determinant of the force of cardiac contraction is the one most discussed and treated. Its specific treatment is by the administration of inotropic drugs, usually catecholamines (see "Treatment of Low Cardiac Output" later in this section).

![](_page_8_Figure_4.jpeg)

Figure 5-8 When resistance to ejection is altered, pressure-dimension loops at end-systole extend to a straight line termed the *end-systolic pressure-dimension line*. Slope of this line is an index of contractility. Increase in inotropy causes an increase in the slope of the line. It can also be seen that an increase in inotropy causes widening of the loop as ejection shortening is increased. Extrapolation of end-systolic pressure-dimension line to zero pressure defines  $V_0$  (or  $D_0$ ), the dimension the ventricle would attain if intracavitary pressure became zero.

# Relative Performance of Left and Right Ventricles

During and early after cardiac operations, one of the two ventricles is usually the factor limiting cardiac performance, not both. It is usually advantageous to consider and treat patients with this concept clearly in mind. The clue of greatest importance in this regard, when the AV valves are normal, is the relation between the left and right atrial pressures, because they represent the closest approximation available to ventricular end-diastolic pressure and, by implication, sarcomere length. B14 When the cardiac valves are normal, the ventricle with the highest corresponding atrial pressure is the one limiting cardiac performance. Echocardiography can often provide supportive information. S5

#### Heart Rate

Sinus rhythm is optimal postoperatively, and with this rhythm a wide range of heart rates at various ages is compatible with survival (Table 5-2). The normal compensatory response to increased O<sub>2</sub> demand is increased heart rate. Often in the elderly and also in patients with diseased myocardium, this response is absent. It is prudent to manipulate heart rate in otherwise normally convalescing patients with slow sinus (or junctional) rhythm to improve cardiac output. For this, atrial pacing via two temporary atrial leads placed at operation is used. In these situations, atrial pacing is also helpful to suppress premature beats (both atrial and ventricular) and may limit the onset of an established arrhythmia.

#### Cardiac Rhythm

Disturbances of cardiac rhythm may also contribute to low cardiac output. Junctional (AV nodal) rhythm reduces cardiac output by 10% to 15%. Junctional rhythm is less efficient than sinus rhythm because the atrial contribution to ventricular filling is absent in the former. Because junctional rhythm is usually transient and its effects are easily overcome by atrial pacing (unless the rate is rapid),  $^{\rm H6}$  its presence does not connote an added immediate risk.

Bradyarrhythmias due to damage to the AV node or His bundle, hypoxemia, or drugs can result in low cardiac output. Tachyarrhythmias in the form of atrial fibrillation or flutter or paroxysmal atrial tachycardia may result in hypotension. Risk of tachyarrhythmias increases during infusion of catecholamines. A complete discussion of postoperative rhythm

disturbances and their treatment is found later in this section under "Cardiac Arrhythmias."

# Causes of Acute Dysfunction (Low Cardiac Output) after Cardiac Surgery

### *Inadequate Operation*

The surgeon's responsibility for obtaining an adequate operation demands that he or she continue to search for evidence of this postoperatively, particularly when the patient has low cardiac output. Using the methods described in this and other chapters, a search is made for residual intra- or extracardiac shunting, pathway obstructions, valvar regurgitation, graft or conduit dysfunction, or cardiac compression. If the operation is found to be inadequate in any of these regards, prompt reoperation is usually indicated.

# *Myocardial Dysfunction*

Myocardial dysfunction was once thought to explain low cardiac output after cardiac surgery when atrial pressures were elevated above the usual postoperative values in the absence of any other explanation. The availability of two-dimensional echocardiography in the OR and ICU, particularly TEE, makes possible both direct demonstration of ventricular wall motion and assessment of end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes. These studies can lead more directly to the inference that low cardiac output is due to myocardial necrosis or stunning or to impaired cardiac reserve in the face of increased stress. This inference can be supported by the finding of increased creatine kinase (CK)-MB isoenzyme or troponin in the serum.

# *Reduced Preload*

**Hypovolemia.** The most common cause of reduced preload is overlooked hypovolemia. This may be a relative intravascular loss secondary to vasodilatation, bleeding into undrained cavities (pleural spaces, retroperitoneum, or free peritoneal space), or uncharted chest tube drainage. The most obvious cause of hypovolemia, of course, is bleeding associated with cardiotomy or CPB, reflected by excessive chest tube output. Low cardiac output or low arterial blood pressure associated with low filling pressures (left or right atrial pressure, central venous pressure, or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) is the sine qua non of hypovolemia. Echocardiography showing vigorous wall motion and small chamber size is simply confirmatory.

Occasionally there is a sympathetic response that supports blood pressure, but often this is blunted early after anesthesia. There may be reflex tachycardia, but ultimately cardiac output suffers.

Infrequently, excessive diuresis leads to relative hypovolemia and lowering of cardiac output. In this instance, the picture may be complicated by hypokalemia leading to arrhythmias.

**Diastolic Dysfunction.** In the presence of LV hypertrophy, fibrosis, or myocardial edema, filling pressures do not reflect ventricular volume. In this situation, ventricular compliance is diminished. The root problem is inadequate resting (diastolic) sarcomere length. In these situations, echocardiography is especially useful. The picture is characterized by a small ventricular chamber in the presence of high filling pressure, tachycardia, small stroke volume, low arterial blood pressure, and low cardiac output. Appropriate interventions should be aimed at decreasing heart rate, initiating β-blockade, and subsequent volume infusion. Some inotropic agents may be detrimental in this situation.

**Acute Cardiac Tamponade.** Acute pericardial tamponade (with its resultant acute decrease in ventricular preload in the face of elevated atrial pressures) must always be considered when low cardiac output is present early postoperatively. Undrained intrapericardial bleeding may cause acute cardiac tamponade. It may also occur as a result of marked myocardial edema and chamber dilatation inside the closed chest, because the pericardium can be constricting under these circumstances even when it has not been resutured. Acute dilatation of the RV during an acute pulmonary hypertensive crisis may result in acute atypical tamponade in neonates and infants.K11 It is these phenomena that explain the advantage of leaving the sternum open and covering the mediastinum with an impermeable sheet sutured to the skin edges in critically ill patients, or of opening it in the ICU when this form of cardiac tamponade is limiting cardiac output.K11,M27,O3

After an early period of adequate and stable cardiac output, cardiac tamponade is a likely cause of rapid deterioration that cannot be easily explained otherwise. It is usually associated with rapidly rising right and left atrial pressures that often, but not always, equalize. Often, drainage from chest tubes is initially brisk and then ceases, and serial chest radiographs show progressive widening of the cardiac and superior mediastinal shadows. Arterial pressure falls, and a paradoxical pulse may be replaced by a narrow pulse pressure. Characteristically, arterial pressure shows a minimal response to a bolus injection of an inotrope. TEE examination is indicated as soon as cardiac tamponade from retained intrapericardial blood is suspected, and is often diagnostic.

Cardiac tamponade can also manifest in multiple atypical presentations that must always be considered when acute low cardiac output develops. For example, right and left atrial pressures may differ widely in the setting of impacted clot adjacent to the right atrium. Neither TEE nor transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is reliable for detecting this impacted clot, creating the potential for misdiagnosing tamponade as acute RV failure secondary to other causes such as pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, when the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade is considered as a possible etiology of low cardiac output that does not promptly respond to nonsurgical intervention, emergent reoperation is advisable (or reopening the sternum at bedside, especially in infants).

#### *Increased Ventricular Afterload*

Increased RV afterload may appear quickly as a result of a sudden rise in pulmonary artery pressure and vascular resistance. Consequently, during an episode of paroxysmal pulmonary hypertension (often provoked by intratracheal suctioning), cardiac output may fall rapidly and apparently "sudden" death may occur, particularly in neonates and infants. These outcomes are probably not purely the result of increased RV afterload, because they reflect impaired RV reserve as well.

Increased LV afterload may result from a sudden elevation of systemic arterial pressure, such as may occur during suctioning, restlessness, or hypoxia. These result in a sudden increase in LV afterload that, combined with impaired LV reserves, can result in low cardiac output early postoperatively. Sustained increase in systemic vascular resistance and LV afterload is present early after cardiac operations in at least half the adult patients operated on for acquired heart disease.  $^{\rm E13,F13,W4}$ 

Often, disturbances of afterload (afterload mismatch) and preload (preload reserve)<sup>R17</sup> are neither independent nor isolated events. Increased RV afterload leads to decreased LV preload. Similarly, but not as important, increased LV afterload leads to decreased RV preload. A common situation in which a corrective operation leads to increased LV afterload is restoration of mitral valve competence or closure of a ventricular septal defect (VSD). In a physics analogy, mitral regurgitation or left-to-right flow through a VSD represents a pair of resistors in a parallel circuit in which  $R_T = 1/r_1 + 1/r_2$ , where  $r_1$  and  $r_2$  represent resistances in the two outflow streams and  $R_T$  is total resistance. Closure of one outflow (r) increases downstream resistance to ventricular shortening; by inference, wall tension and myocardial oxygen consumption  $(M\dot{V}O_2)$  increase.

# Risk Factors for Low Cardiac Output

A number of circumstances increase the probability of low cardiac output after cardiac surgery. These have been determined for the most part by numerous multivariable analyses of outcomes after surgery for specific conditions (see Chapters 7 through 58).

# Patient-Specific

Chronic impairment of ventricular preload, afterload, and/or contractility by any mechanism (ventricular hypertrophy, stiffness, chronic heart failure) increases the risk of low cardiac output after the cardiac surgical procedure. These are for the most part immutable risk factors for low cardiac output, because they do not change quickly after the operation. However, when a patient who had been alive and ambulatory preoperatively has inadequate cardiac output postoperatively, the assumption must be that intraoperative damage has been superimposed on the chronic state. On the other hand, certain surgical procedures, such as ablation of the regurgitant volume of aortic regurgitation or closure of a defect with a large left-to-right shunt, have an immediately favorable impact on cardiac output. Thus, the cardiac surgical procedure itself often increases cardiac output; it is myocardial damage during the procedure that decreases it.

Acute reduction in ventricular contractility preoperatively can sometimes be ameliorated by intraoperative maneuvers. For the most part, these maneuvers are directed toward increasing an acutely reduced energy charge (see "Cold Cardioplegia, Controlled Aortic Root Reperfusion, and [When Needed] Warm Cardioplegic Induction" under Methods of Myocardial Management during Cardiac Surgery in Chapter 3).

#### Procedural

The most important intraoperative risk factor for low cardiac output early postoperatively, other than an incomplete operation, is a discrepancy between the duration of any global myocardial ischemia and the efficacy of the measures used for myocardial management (see complete discussion in Chapter 3). This is often reflected in the finding of long global myocardial ischemic time as a risk factor for low cardiac output and for death after operation. Coronary air embolization during CPB is said to adversely affect cardiac performance after the operation, but most air entering the coronary

arteries while the heart is not supporting the circulation passes quickly into the coronary sinus and may have little deleterious effect.

The extensiveness of the "whole body inflammatory response" to CPB affects the heart as well and relates to the probability of low cardiac output after operation. This is one aspect of the association of duration of CPB with death after operation; another is that long CPB duration is sometimes the result, rather than the cause, of poor cardiac performance.

Low cardiac output can be the result of (1) an incomplete or inadequate operation; (2) acute myocardial ischemia, with or without necrosis, from impaired coronary blood flow resulting from failure of some part of a coronary artery bypass operation (CABG); (3) incomplete relief of ventricular inflow or outflow obstruction; (4) important residual or created AV valve or semilunar valve regurgitation that may increase the stroke volume requirements of the ventricle; and (5) residual VSD and large left-to-right shunt that may similarly increase LV stroke volume requirements.

One of the reasons for placing temporary fine polyvinyl catheters in the left atrium, right atrium, occasionally the pulmonary trunk via the RV and uncommonly the LV, and for placing temporary epicardial atrial and ventricular wires, is that they can be helpful in intraoperative and early postoperative efforts to identify an inadequate or incomplete operation as the cause of low cardiac output. TEE with color flow Doppler imaging is also important in identifying an incomplete or inadequate operation. The possibility of residual left-to-right shunting contributing to low cardiac output must always be considered after repair of congenital heart disease. With the materials now used as patches for repair of VSDs, an appreciable left-to-right shunt (Qp/Qs > 1.5) early postoperatively must be assumed to represent an incomplete repair or an overlooked defect. The shunt can be quantified by double indicator dilution, a method rarely used in the current era. W29 Alternatively, the left-to-right shunt may be estimated in terms of the pulmonary  $(\dot{Q}p)$  to systemic  $(\dot{Q}s)$ flow ratio by simultaneously removing samples from the radial artery, right atrium, and pulmonary artery and solving the simplified shunt equation:

$$\dot{Q}p/\dot{Q}s = \frac{SaO_2 - SRAO_2}{SaO_2 - SPAO_2}$$

where  $SaO_2$  is the percent oxygen saturation of arterial blood,  $SRAO_2$  that of blood withdrawn from the right atrium, and  $SPAO_2$  that of blood withdrawn from the pulmonary artery.

TEE with color flow Doppler imaging now can sometimes settle the issue simply, but without the desirable quantification. Intraoperative TEE has become standard of care for intracardiac repairs of congenital heart disease for patients 3 kg or larger. In one study, intraoperative TEE during postrepair evaluation led to surgical revision in 4% of cases. Ut

#### Course of Low Cardiac Output

The heart is in an especially vulnerable position early postoperatively, because its poor function adversely affects coronary blood flow; this in turn further worsens cardiac function. This explains the observation that low cardiac output early after cardiac operations rarely resolves spontaneously. Aggressive treatment is indicated.

With treatment, most patients with low cardiac output early postoperatively recover, and unless it was produced by a large area of myocardial necrosis, most patients have no demonstrable ill effects from it late postoperatively.

# Treatment of Low Cardiac Output

Experience indicates that it is worthwhile to intensively treat patients with low or inadequate cardiac output early after cardiac surgery, because cardiac performance often improves after 1 or 2 days, followed by good recovery.

Many causes of low cardiac output are reversible. Investigating whether cardiac tamponade or compression is the cause is one of the first steps (see "Acute Cardiac Tamponade" earlier in this section). If tamponade is present and is caused by retained blood in the pericardium, emergency reoperation is indicated. If there is acute cardiac dilatation, such as may occur in a pulmonary hypertensive crisis,D2,K36 the sternum and pericardium should be rapidly opened (if they were closed). In patients at an increased risk of low cardiac output, this complication can be prevented by leaving the sternum open at operation and closing it 24 to 48 hours later.F2,J8,M24 The pericardium should rarely be closed after cardiac operations, because this has a restrictive effect on the heart early postoperatively.D3

When cardiac constriction is believed not to be present, treatment is directed at increasing cardiac output by manipulating preload, afterload, contractile state, and heart rate and improving tissue oxygen levels. When these measures fail, use of devices to support the circulation must be considered (see "Intraaortic Balloon Pump" and "Temporary Ventricular Assistance" later in this section). All such devices have their own risks and imponderables; except for the intraaortic balloon pump, they are typically not used unless it seems likely the patient will not survive without them. The decision to use such devices is always made with concern for the possibility the patient may survive but be left seriously disabled, and with knowledge of the costs of such interventions.B5,K8

# *Noninvasive Methods*

When cardiac output is low, *preload* is manipulated by increasing blood volume with an appropriate fluid until the higher of the two atrial pressures is about 15 mmHg. If the wall thickness of the LV is unusually great or its contractility or compliance is decreased, it may be helpful to raise mean left atrial pressure to 20 mmHg. However, the tendency to pulmonary edema is increased when left atrial pressure is elevated to this level. When the RV is the limiting factor in cardiac performance, right atrial pressure usually can be raised advantageously only to about 18 mmHg. Above this, a descending limb on the Starling curve usually becomes apparent, and cardiac output falls. Also, the tendency to whole body fluid retention, pleural effusion, and ascites is increased by high right atrial pressure.

When LV performance is the limiting factor and systemic arterial blood pressure is more than 10% above normal (see Table 5-1), vasodilating agents should be used to reduce LV *afterload* to between normal and 10% above normal. Nitroprusside is generally the drug of choice because it is a potent arterial, and to a lesser extent venous, dilator with a short half-life (see Appendix 5A). The drug appears to be as safe in very young patients as it is in adults.K38 Calcium channel antagonists (e.g., nifedipine, diltiazem) lead to similar arteriolar vasodilatation and may improve coronary perfusion in this setting.M32 However, their longer half-life and depressive effect on ventricular contractility make nitroprusside the preferred drug.

Rarely in patients with severe long-standing mitral valve disease or congenital heart disease with pulmonary vascular obstructive changes, RV dysfunction associated with elevated pulmonary artery pressure may limit cardiac performance. Reduction of RV afterload with vasodilating agents is occasionally dramatic in its increase of RV, and thus cardiac, stroke volume. Nitroprusside (0.5 to 3 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), nitroglycerin (0.5 to 3 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), or phentolamine (1.5 to 2 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) may be effective in this setting.K17 In infants, maintaining near-anesthesia for 24 to 48 hours with fentanyl or another intravenously administered agent may minimize paroxysms of pulmonary artery hypertension and the consequent increased RV afterload (see "Pulmonary Hypertensive Crises" later in this section).L16

Alternatively, management of neonates and infants may be based on use of the long-acting α-receptor blocking agent phenoxybenzamine (see Appendix 5A). It is administered first at the commencement of CPB (see "Other Additives" under Perfusate in Section II of Chapter 2). An additional dose is usually given about 12 hours after returning to the ICU.

Heart rate is adjusted to optimal levels when necessary by atrial pacing, by ventricular pacing when atrial fibrillation is present, or by AV sequential pacing when AV dyssynchrony or dissociation is present. When tachyarrhythmias are present, pharmacologic means of control may be used (see text that follows).

If these relatively simple measures do not quickly bring cardiac performance to an adequate level, inotropic agents are begun (see Appendix 5B for details), although their disadvantages are recognized. There is no ideal inotropic agent, nor are there specific indications for specific agents. In their review, Doyle and colleaguesD20 classified inotropic drugs based on their effect on intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP): cAMP-independent drugs include calcium, digoxin, and α-adrenergic agonists; cAMPdependent agents include epinephrine (and levarterenol), dobutamine, and isoproterenol. These are β-adrenergic agonists that, coupled with dopaminergic drugs (dopamine), have variable effects on peripheral resistance. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (amrinone, milrinone, enoximone) may enhance contractility while producing myocardial relaxation (lusitropism) and relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. They are not susceptible to receptor down-regulation.

Initially, *dopamine* may be infused at 2.5 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . This dose can be increased to 15 or 20 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> if needed, but if a favorable response is not obtained at 10 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , it is not likely to be obtained at higher doses. Dopamine has the advantage of augmenting renal blood flow in addition to increasing cardiac contractility.H26 Dopamine increases ventricular automaticity (hence the probability of ventricular arrhythmias), but to a lesser extent than isoproterenol. At low doses (2 to 4 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), systemic peripheral vascular resistance is decreased or unchanged by dopamine, whereas higher doses (>6 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) increase peripheral resistance.G13 Tachycardia may limit the rate at which dopamine can be administered. When dopamine is ineffective, *dobutamine* is gradually added in similar doses. Dobutamine, although more expensive than dopamine, appears to augment myocardial blood flow moreF10; in general, its effectiveness is similar to dopamine.D15 *Isoproterenol* may be preferred initially and is probably superior in the presence of predominantly RV dysfunction and decreased or normal heart rate because of its favorable effect on pulmonary vascular resistance.

Occasionally, hypotension exists in the presence of normal and adequate cardiac output. Under that special circumstance, *norepinephrine* administered through a central venous catheter is rational treatment; a very low dose (0.01 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) is often sufficient under these circumstances. Under more dire circumstances, larger doses can be used.

*Epinephrine* is the catecholamine of choice of some, but its powerful vasoconstricting effects make it less desirable than dopamine or dobutamine. When an insufficient response is obtained from other drugs, or excessive tachycardia develops, epinephrine is added or substituted. The drug is initially infused at a dose of 0.01 to 0.05 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , which may be increased as needed.

*Milrinone* also is useful in patients with low cardiac output after cardiac surgery, because it combines a peripheral vasodilatory action with its inotropic effect.G12 This drug is different in structure and mode of action from catecholamines in that it is a phosphodiesterase enzyme inhibitor in cardiac and vascular tissue, not a β-adrenergic receptor agonist. Administration is usually initiated with a loading dose of 5 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> over 10 minutes, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.3 to 0.75 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . The drug is effective in neonates and infants as well as adults, but in small patients, particular care is necessary to maintain an adequate blood volume because of the vasodilatory effect of the drug.L2 The indications for this drug vs. catecholamines remain arguable. However, it appears to cause less tachycardia and fewer atrial arrhythmias than catecholamines.R18

Additionally, 10% calcium chloride is administered in a dose of 0.1 mmol · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , with supplemental doses if the ionized serum calcium level is below 1.2 mmol · L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> .

Once the acute problems have subsided, some patients in sinus rhythm appear to require chronic augmentation of ventricular contractile function. Use of *digitalis* in this setting has long been argued, but there is evidence that it does increase contractility.C21 Digitalization appears to be useful, particularly in children (see "Atrial Arrhythmias" under Cardiac Arrhythmias later in this section), but it is not recommended in neonates because it may impair diastolic function.K30

### *Intraaortic Balloon Pump*

The concept of intraaortic balloon pumping (IABP) to produce diastolic augmentation of coronary and systemic blood flow was elucidated by Moulopoulos, Topaz, and Kolff in 1962.M29 The procedure was first performed clinically by Kantrowitz and colleagues in 1968.K5 IABP uses the principle of diastolic counterpulsation, which augments diastolic coronary perfusion pressure, reduces systolic afterload, favorably affects the myocardial oxygen supply/demand ratio, and augments cardiac output.

IABP is used in adult patients with inadequate cardiac performance not responsive to optimized preload, afterload, and heart rate or to moderate doses (up to 10 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) of dopamine or equivalent doses of dobutamine or epinephrine (see Appendix 5B). Whenever possible, the decision to insert an IABP is made in the OR rather than postoperatively. It is used in preference to catecholamines postoperatively for patients with severe LV dysfunction, with or without evidence of myocardial necrosis, and for patients with evidence of myocardial necrosis and inadequate cardiac output or severe ventricular arrhythmias. This technique has led to survival of some patients who would otherwise have died.D18,D19,P14 Survival is less than 50% if renal failure develops from low cardiac output postoperatively.D19 IABP has been effective in patients with ischemic heart disease and valvar and congenital heart disease.D19

Preoperative prophylactic insertion of the IABP is sometimes advisable. In addition to its use in myocardial infarction with low cardiac output or shock, preoperative insertion is often helpful in unstable angina, left main disease with ongoing ischemia, and ischemia leading to ventricular arrhythmias. In the era of more complex arterial revascularization for ischemic heart disease (see Chapter 7), IABP support is helpful intraoperatively for pre-bypass support of patients with low ejection fraction. For patients with acute mitral regurgitation or ventricular septal rupture, insertion upon diagnosis is often lifesaving. Perhaps the most frequent indication for preoperative IABP insertion is poor perfusion from either low cardiac output or peripheral arterial disease. It follows that the best survival following IABP occurs when the device is in place preoperatively.D19

Insertion by arterial puncture is generally used, despite its somewhat higher prevalence of vascular complications,G14 because of the technical ease of balloon insertion and removal. When the patient is still on CPB, or the femoral pulse cannot be palpated because of hypotension, an incision only in the skin is made over the femoral artery. Through this incision, the femoral artery can nearly always be palpated and the arterial puncture technique used.

Important aortoiliac occlusive disease and abdominal aortic aneurysm greatly increase the risk of vascular complications or failure of insertion when the femoral route is used.G15 In their presence, the balloon can be inserted into the ascending aorta through a purse-string suture. This is usually performed before discontinuing CPB. A pledgeted mattress suture of 2-0 or 3-0 polypropylene is placed in the midportion of the ascending aorta. A tie is placed on the shaft of the intraaortic balloon to indicate the point that should be level with the aortic wall when the balloon is in proper position within the descending aorta. An aortic stab wound is made and controlled digitally, and the balloon is introduced through the wound and passed into the descending aorta. Proper position is verified by appearance of the characteristic aortic pressure pulse when pumping is begun. The balloon shaft is usually brought out through the lower end of the sternotomy incision. When pumping is no longer needed, the patient is returned to the OR, the median sternotomy reopened, and another pledgeted mattress suture placed outside the original one. As the balloon is removed, the stab wound is controlled digitally, and the pledgeted mattress suture is made snug and tied. In severe atheromatous aortic wall disease, use of other assist devices is probably indicated (see "Temporary Ventricular Assistance" in text that follows).

IABP is begun in a 1:1 ratio with ventricular diastole, as judged by electrocardiographic (ECG) and arterial pressure pulse signals. Often the patient's hemodynamic state improves promptly; consideration is then given to weaning the patient from IABP as early as 6 to 12 hours after insertion. If catecholamines have also been required, they are reduced as rapidly as possible to 5 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> of dopamine or less, or the equivalent doses of dobutamine or epinephrine (see Appendix 5B). Once the hemodynamic state is improved, the IABP ratio is progressively reduced to 1:8 (or 1:3 with some systems). In most postoperative patients, the final reduction can be reached within 12 to 48 hours. The balloon can then be removed using a closed method. Although objections have been raised to use of this method,C35 most of the problems have occurred when the balloon inadvertently was inserted through the superficial rather than the common femoral artery. After removing the balloon percutaneously, firm pressure is applied to the groin and held for half an hour. If circulation to the leg becomes impaired or a hematoma becomes apparent, prompt exploration in the OR is indicated.

Circulation in the leg distal to the site of balloon insertion is observed systematically. If signs of ischemia appear, generally the balloon is removed. Complications that importantly impede convalescence occur in about 3% of patients.K10

# *Temporary Ventricular Assistance*

Ventricular assist devices (VADs), probably first used in a planned fashion by Cooley and colleagues in 1969,C22 are now used (1) for support after cardiac operations, (2) as a bridge to transplantation, and (3) as a bridge to recovery. Without VADs, nearly all patients assisted would likely have died; however, uncertainty about this makes interpreting outcomes and indications for them difficult. It also hampers efforts to determine their direct risks. The following discussion relates to use of various temporary VADs for cardiopulmonary failure after cardiac operations. (A discussion of use of these devices for other indications can be found in Chapter 22.)

**Temporary Ventricular Assist Devices.** Low cardiac output accompanying reduced ventricular function following cardiac operations occasionally prohibits separating the patient from CPB. A thorough investigation for correctable causes of low cardiac output should be made and may include ensuring aortocoronary bypass graft patency and adequacy of flow using Doppler ultrasound flow velocity or electromagnetic flow probes, and evaluating accuracy of repairs and segmental ventricular wall motion using intraoperative TEE. Preload and afterload should be optimized, appropriate pharmacologic agents administered, and IABP instituted. When these measures are insufficient, temporary ventricular assistance should be considered.

Use of a temporary VAD often follows a prolonged operation and a long period on CPB. Insertion of an implantable VAD under these circumstances is inadvisable (see Chapter 22). Temporary support of the failing circulation allows postponing further major operative intervention until the patient's condition improves. The temporary assist system can be used as a bridge to ventricular recovery or as a bridge to more durable mechanical circulatory support if weaning is not possible (see Chapter 22).

Temporary ventricular assist is set up as right or left heart bypass or as a combined biventricular bypass circuit. Cannulae for left and right heart bypasses are introduced through the midline sternotomy used during the cardiac operation. (Using cannulae previously placed makes the transition from CPB to right and left heart bypass a more controlled process.) With those cannulae in place, an additional thin-walled metaltip right-angle cannula (28F) is introduced into the left atrium via the right superior pulmonary vein or via the roof of the left atrium through a purse-string stitch with a short tourniquet. The purse-string stitch may be felt-reinforced if tissues are thin or friable, because bleeding around the perfusion cannulae is frequently troublesome and may require reexploration. An arterial cannula (24F wire thin-wall) is placed in the pulmonary trunk.

*Left heart bypass* is established by connecting the left atrial cannula to the aortic cannula via a centrifugal pump. This ventricular bypass circuit provides continuous blood flow.

*Right heart bypass* is established by connecting the right atrial cannula to the pulmonary trunk cannula via a centrifugal pump. Pump flow is increased gradually to 4.0 to 5.0 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> for adult patients as CPB flow is reduced and discontinued. The cannulae are brought through the fascia, muscle, and skin into the left and right upper quadrants of the abdomen at the time of insertion or connection to the extracorporeal circuit. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) felt strips are placed tightly around the cannulae in the subcutaneous tissues to seal the exit tract. In some cases, the cannulae are simply brought through the wound. The midline incision may be closed primarily in some cases. More often, cardiac compression results from wound closure. The skin only may then be closed, leaving the sternal edges apart; alternatively, a silicone membrane is sewn to the skin edges to seal the mediastinum. The edges of the membrane are sealed with iodine ointment to eliminate ingress of air and present a barrier to bacteria. Bulky dressings are applied and sealed to the skin with a large iodine-impregnated plastic adhesive.

Heparin-coated tubing and centrifugal pumps are desirable to reduce trauma to blood elements by providing a more blood-compatible extracorporeal circuit. Roller pumps can also be used but seldom are, because of the perception that more blood elements are injured. Short tubing reduces foreign blood contact surface and heat loss in the extracorporeal circuit.

An alternative, pulsatile extracorporeal blood pump system is also available (ABIOMED Inc., Danvers, Mass.). The pump consists of a compliant inflow chamber to which blood is drained by gravity, separated from a rigid pumping chamber by a polyurethane inflow valve. The pumping chamber is fitted with a polyurethane outflow valve. A sac within the pumping chamber is expanded pneumatically to propel the blood. Components of the system are arranged vertically and placed at the bedside. A console provides pneumatic power, senses filling of the pumping device, and synchronizes pumping so that little attention to the system is required. Anticoagulation with heparin is necessary, and the patient must remain immobile, as with other temporary systems. It may be used in left, right, or biventricular assist configuration. Although the system provides the possible advantages of pulsatile flow and less operator attention, it costs substantially more than centrifugal pump systems.

Bypass support of a single failing ventricle is used when possible. It is frequently possible to bypass a failing RV using an extracorporeal ventricular assist system combined with IABP to support the LV. Bypass support of the failing LV seems more complicated. In theory, the LV can be sustained by left atrial–to-aortic bypass while the unassisted RV continues to provide adequate pulmonary flow. Experience has shown, however, that RV function also declines. Biventricular support is frequently advisable even when there is apparent isolated LV failure.

**Management.** Each of these devices has specific methods and equipment for insertion and late management. In general, anticoagulation with heparin followed by warfarin is required for all devices with mechanical valves, and low-dose anticoagulation with heparin, warfarin, or aspirin is used for those with biological valves. However, management details vary among institutions and devices.

Bleeding from the primary operative site is controlled by reversal of heparin with protamine. Platelet infusion, transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or other blood products, and pharmacologic agents to promote normalization of the blood clotting subsystem are administered as indicated. A heparin-bonded extracorporeal circuit is adequate to prevent clotting in the short term. When bleeding from the operative site has ceased or slowed, heparin therapy is restarted. Usually this occurs within 12 hours after completing the operation. Activated clotting time (ACT) is used to monitor heparin effect; desired ACT is approximately 160 to 200 seconds (assuming a control level of 100 to 120 seconds).

Postoperative care of patients on left, right, or biventricular bypass is labor intensive. Continuous bedside care, often by more than one nurse, is required, as is ready availability of a cardiopulmonary perfusionist or other personnel capable of managing the extracorporeal assist system. Bleeding is frequently a nuisance or even a major complication requiring frequent monitoring of blood clotting by ACT. Smooth operation of the system requires frequent infusion of blood products to maintain adequate atrial pressures. Body temperature is monitored continuously, and measures are taken to heat or cool the blood in the extracorporeal circuit or the patient's body with a heating/cooling blanket. The VAD system may be fitted with ports for hemofiltration to remove excess extracellular fluid if there is marked edema. Occasionally, hemodialysis is necessary. Ventilatory assist is required.

Separating the patient from temporary ventricular assistance requires judgment and patience. There is a tendency to remove systems too early to avoid complications directly related to prolonged extracorporeal circulation. It is advisable to wait a day or so longer rather than rush the process of separation. Ability of the heart to support the circulation is tested by reducing flow into the extracorporeal circuit, thereby raising atrial pressures and allowing flow through the supported ventricle. There is a limit to which flow in an extracorporeal circuit can be reduced without introducing danger of clotting. Flow of less than about 1 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> should be avoided. Heparin levels should be maintained, and duration of testing interval should be short. Cardiac function is monitored by TEE and continuous measurement of arterial and pulmonary artery pressures, atrial pressures, cardiac output, and SvO2. If the heart cannot sustain adequate cardiac output under conditions of low-flow bypass, the separation process is abandoned, full flow is resumed, and plans are made for later attempts at separation or conversion to an implantable device. Simply removing the temporary device in anticipation that the heart will sustain adequate function is usually unsuccessful.

**Results.** Results are judged either by recovery and longterm survival after removal of the device or by success in maintaining the patient until cardiac transplantation is accomplished. Clearly, some patients not only survive but also have an excellent long-term functional result.K7,M2,P13,R15,S24 Of some importance in this regard is the finding that myocardial cellular atrophy is not a complication of prolonged ventricular assistance.J2 Despite excellent intensive care, patients with VADs are at risk of thromboembolism, hemorrhage, and infection.

The report of the combined registry for clinical use of mechanical VADs summarized experience with 965 patients.P3 For about half of them, successful weaning from the device was accomplished, and about half of those weaned were discharged from the hospital alive. Two-year survival among patients discharged from the hospital was 82%, with most being in NYHA functional class I or II. A higher proportion of patients receiving LV assist devices had satisfactory outcomes than was the case in those receiving biventricular assist devices. The probability of survival was similar in patients receiving nonpulsatile centrifugal pump devices and those receiving pulsatile pneumatic devices. Survival to discharge for the multi-institutional experience was about 30% for postcardiotomy support. Individual institutions have recorded discharge of up to 60%, and this seems to be related to greater experience with the devices and earlier establishment of support.J5,K4,P12

**Indications.** The complex scientific, surgical, ethical, moral, political, philosophical, and financial considerations necessarily involved in the decision for mechanical circulatory support do not permit a simple listing of indications for this therapy.

There is general agreement that a low cardiac output (cardiac index ≤ 1.5 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ) and elevated ventricular diastolic pressure (reflected in high left or right atrial pressure) after continuing CPB an hour beyond the usual time of discontinuance, with IABP support and administration of catecholamines in moderate doses, indicate a low probability of survival.H9 Trial separation from CPB has failed (usually reflected in a progressive drop of systemic arterial blood pressure, elevation of atrial pressures, reduction of venous oxygen saturation, and metabolic acidosis). Under these conditions, in institutions prepared for it and, if necessary, cardiac transplantation (even if this means transportation to another institution), temporary ventricular assistance is usually indicated. Patients with continuing low cardiac output in the ICU despite IABP and catecholamine support also should be considered for temporary ventricular assistance. Use of temporary ventricular assistance is appropriate for patients of any age whose myocardial problem is expected to resolve within a few days, and for patients younger than 65 to 70 years of age whose myocardial problem is not expected to resolve but who are acceptable candidates for cardiac transplantation. In the latter group, the temporary device is used for support while it is determined whether there is good function of major organ systems and the patient is neurologically intact.

Further experience with VADs may lead to discarding current criteria in favor of more liberal use; in part, this is because LV assistance is more effective than IABP in preserving myocardial structure and function, at least in experimental studies.M23 In general, the younger the patient, the better the prognosis from the now-repaired cardiac disease, and the fewer the other subsystem diseases and failures, the stronger the indication for temporary ventricular assistance.

# *Cardiopulmonary Support and Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation*

Right and left heart bypass (biventricular assist) works only if pulmonary function is adequate to support gas exchange. In situations of severe compromise of the respiratory system, support of that system is also required. Portable CPB systems (cardiopulmonary support [CPS]) include both a centrifugal blood pump and a membrane oxygenator, with heparincoated tubing. These systems are usually referred to as *extracorporeal membrane oxygenation* (ECMO). Successful use has been reported, particularly in infants and children,K3 and there is little doubt that in some patients, it is an effective means of biventricular support. (It may be used occasionally in venovenous configuration to support respiration in the face of severe postoperative arterial desaturation from impaired pulmonary function.B4) This methodology has also been used in patients undergoing myocardial infarction or sustaining a catastrophic event in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, and as a support technique during angioplasty.P15

Only two cannulae have to be inserted, one in the right atrium and the other in a systemic artery. These cannulae are present during surgery and may simply be attached to the system. Oxygenation is achieved in a closed system without an air-to-blood interface. Alternatively, separate venous and arterial cannulae may be inserted through the femoral artery and femoral or jugular vein by percutaneous technique (see "Cardiopulmonary Bypass Established by Peripheral Cannulation" under Special Situations and Controversies in Section III of Chapter 2). This places the cannulae in a position for ready control of hemorrhage. Centrally placed cannulae are removed so that the wound may be closed. Percutaneous placement of cannulae and use of the CPS system can be used for emergency support of the failing circulation at the bedside. The CPS system does not ordinarily provide decompression of the LV. LV unloading depends on total diversion of blood from the right atrium to the extracorporeal circuit and the ability of the LV to empty pulmonary venous return to the aorta. A beating heart and absence of aortic valve regurgitation are necessary.

**Management.** Heparin anticoagulation is required to prevent clotting or excess fibrin formation in the oxygenator membrane. ACT is maintained at approximately 160 to 220 seconds by continuous infusion of heparin.

**Results.** In the pediatric population, overall survival after ECMO support following a cardiac operation is 30% to 40%. It may be more effective in situations complicated by pulmonary hypertension or in the presence of a two-ventricle repair, compared with repairs in which there is a cavopulmonary connection or aortopulmonary shunt.K37,L15,M21 In adults, ECMO seems more cumbersome than temporary LV or biventricular assistance, and hospital survival may be lower than in children.M31 However, Smedira and colleagues reported 30-day survival of 38% in 202 adults supported by ECMO with intent to wean or bridge to transplant.S23,S24 Patients who survived 30 days had a 63% 5-year survival. Risk factors for death included older age, reoperation, subsystem failure while on ECMO, and occurrence of a neurologic event while on ECMO.

**Indications.** The imponderables, and therefore the uncertainties, as to indications for this type of support after cardiac surgery are similar to those for temporary VADs; in addition, the need for nearly full heparinization and the presence of an oxygenator in the circuit are disadvantages of ECMO.

#### Cardiac Arrhythmias

Postoperative morbidity and mortality can result from cardiac arrhythmias, which may occur either when the cardiac subsystem has been otherwise functioning normally or as a complication of low cardiac output. Atrial and ventricular pacing wires, routinely placed at operation (see Chapter 5) and left for 3 to 10 days postoperatively, are of clear benefit in diagnosing and treating postoperative arrhythmias.F15,W1-W3

### *Ventricular Electrical Instability*

Ventricular electrical instability includes PVCs, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. Controversy exists concerning the proportion of postoperative patients with frequent PVCs and some types of ventricular tachycardia who are at risk of developing ventricular fibrillation. Despite this, it is prudent to assume that such arrhythmias early postoperatively place the patient at an increased risk of sudden death. Therefore, to detect such arrhythmias, the ECG is monitored continuously for at least the first 48 hours after operation.

Unifocal isolated PVCs occurring outside the T waves fewer than six times per minute are not known to increase the risk of cardiac death and are compatible with normal convalescence. Other arrhythmias indicate an abnormal convalescence and may require special management. Rarely, atrial fibrillation or isolated premature ventricular beats occurring early (within 2-4 hours) after operation in the presence of hypothermia or low potassium level lead to profound ventricular instability, including ventricular fibrillation.

Management of ventricular electrical instability occurring in cardiac surgery patients after postoperative day 1 or 2 has been importantly affected by the results of the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST).C2,E10 This trial demonstrated that drugs used to suppress ventricular electrical instability can themselves be lethal and are often ineffective. Application of these findings to the postoperative patient and implications for treatment are not well understood. For example, CAST patients for the most part had persisting ischemia; most postoperative patients (coronary disease or not) are probably well revascularized. In the postoperative period, however, many antiarrhythmic agents are proarrhythmic; therefore, treating ventricular arrhythmias other than ventricular tachycardia is probably not necessary.

In patients with an ejection fraction under 40% with postoperative ventricular tachycardia, early electrophysiologic study is indicated. Paradoxically, patients in whom such studies demonstrate acute suppression of PVCs or ventricular tachycardia with the administration of drugs have a good prognosis without drug treatment; such patients probably should be discharged from the hospital on no drug therapy. By contrast, patients whose ventricular arrhythmias cannot be suppressed with drugs have a relatively poor prognosis, and consideration should be given to implanting an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD; see "Ventricular Tachycardia and Ventricular Fibrillation in Ischemic Heart Disease" in Section V of Chapter 16).

When during the first day or two of convalescence, ventricular electrical instability develops in the form of PVCs occurring more than six times per minute or ventricular tachycardia persisting more than 20 to 30 seconds, treatment is prudent even if cardiac performance is good (Appendix 5C). Often, PVCs or bursts of ventricular tachycardia can be suppressed by atrial or ventricular pacing using temporary electrodes, without need for drug therapy. When the hemodynamic state is impaired by ventricular tachycardia, immediate direct current cardioversion (100 J initially in adults and, if ineffective, 200 J) is indicated. When these measures are ineffective, advice of an experienced electrophysiologically oriented cardiologist is indicated.

# *Atrial Arrhythmias*

**Prevalence and Risk Factors for Atrial Fibrillation.** Reported prevalence of atrial fibrillation after adult cardiac operations is 20% or higher.A10,C30,S30 New-onset atrial fibrillation usually occurs within 5 days of cardiac surgery, with peak occurrence on the second day.F18 This arrhythmia uncommonly results in major morbidity or death but can complicate convalescence considerably. It is most likely to develop in patients in whom chronic atrial fibrillation has been present before operation and who have left the OR in sinus rhythm.D17

The largest group of patients in whom atrial fibrillation occurs but who did not have it preoperatively are those undergoing CABG. In this group, discontinuance postoperatively of a β-adrenergic receptor blocking agent that has been taken regularly before operation increases the risk of developing atrial fibrillation during the postoperative period; this complication can be expected in about 40% of such situations.M11 Older age at operation is also a risk factor for developing atrial fibrillation postoperatively. This arrhythmia develops in about 4% of patients younger than 40 years of age undergoing CABG, compared with 30% of those aged 70 or older.L9 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic renal disease, valvar heart disease, atrial enlargement, increased sympathetic tone, obesity, and prior pericarditisC30,D16 also appear to increase its prevalence.L9 Other preoperative and intraoperative variables do not appear to be correlated with development of atrial fibrillation after cardiac operation.L9

New-onset atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery increases morbidity, length of stay, and cost.N11 Morbidity includes hemodynamic compromise and occasionally embolic events. New postoperative atrial fibrillation is statistically correlated with advanced age but is also seen across a wide spectrum of adult cardiac operations. The peak incidence is 2 to 3 days postoperatively, but it may occur earlier or following discharge. Postoperative atrial fibrillation is usually transient; with treatment, most patients return to sinus rhythm within 2 to 3 days. Patients with preoperative atrial fibrillation are unlikely to return to sinus rhythm, especially if atrial fibrillation has been present for more than 6 months.

**Prevention of Atrial Fibrillation.** Prevalence of new atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery can be reduced by prophylaxis with a β-adrenergic receptor blocking agent.M11,R19,S20 For this purpose, propranolol may be given in doses of 10 to 20 mg three or four times a day, beginning the morning after operation. Alternatively, atenolol may be given in doses of 25 mg three times per day, which is often better tolerated than propranolol. The benefit from β-blockers as prophylaxis against postoperative atrial fibrillation is greatest when the drug is initiated either prior to or immediately after surgery.E1 Amiodarone (a class III antiarrhythmic agent) is also an effective drug for preventing atrial fibrillation, with approximately a 4% to 50% reduction in its prevalence after cardiac surgery. A meta-analysis suggested that amiodarone provided similar protection against postoperative atrial fibrillation as β-blockers and sotalol (another class III antiarrhythmic agent).C32 Pretreatment with digoxin or verapamil does not reliably prevent atrial fibrillation.A10,K33

**Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation.** When atrial fibrillation develops postoperatively, several protocols are appropriate, depending on need for rate control versus conversion to sinus rhythm. In postoperative patients with *chronic atrial fibrillation* with stable and effective hemodynamics who are not in the ICU, digoxin is usually effective for *rate* control, and is indicated for patients with heart failure and LV dysfunction. In the ICU, rate control of atrial fibrillation with preserved ventricular function is most effectively accomplished with intravenous administration of β-blockers (esmolol, metoprolol, or propranolol)F11 or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists (verapamil, diltiazem), exercising caution in the presence of hypotension. Intravenous amiodarone is also useful for rate controlF18 (Table 5-3). It should be noted that intravenous digoxin or calcium channel antagonists should not be used in patients with a preexcitation syndrome; these agents may paradoxically accelerate the ventricular response.

When digoxin is used for rate control, a recommended protocol is found in Appendix 5D. When approximately two thirds of the estimated digitalizing dose has been given and has not accomplished control of the ventricular rate, oral administration of propranolol should be started unless the patient has poor ventricular function or pulmonary disease. If the situation is urgent, propranolol may be given intravenously in doses of 0.5 mg every 2 minutes, to a total intravenous dose of 4 mg in adults. Alternatively, treatment with verapamil may be initiated in doses of 40 mg orally two to three times daily. This drug may be infused intravenously in a dose of 0.075 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> to a maximum dose of 5 mg, but its action is very short when given in this manner, and oral administration should be started promptly.

In patients with new-onset or recurrent postoperative atrial fibrillation, successful conversion to sinus rhythm is usually possible and is advantageous for postoperative hemodynamics. Digoxin is not effective in converting postoperative atrial fibrillation. Amiodarone is currently the first-line drug for pharmacologic conversion of atrial fibrillation.F18 A bolus dose of 5 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in saline is given over a 30- to 40-minute period, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.25 to 0.5 mg · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> for 4 to 8 hours. Following conversion, oral amiodarone is generally recommended for 4 to 6 weeks.C9,D6,S22

Ibutilide (a class III antiarrhythmic agent)R13 is also highly effective in converting postoperative atrial fibrillation and is at least as effective as amiodarone at converting new-onset atrial fibrillation (greater than 75% success).K1 Adult patients are pretreated with intravenous magnesium (1-2 g) to reduce risk of torsades de pointes, and the serum potassium level is normalized. Higher doses of magnesium (up to 4 g divided into pre- and post-ibutilide infusion) have been recommended by some.T4 Under continuous ECG monitoring, 1 mg of ibutilide is administered intravenously over 10 minutes. The dose can be repeated once. The major risk is a 1% to 4% occurrence of torsades.G16,H27 Ibutilide should be avoided in patients with very low ejection fraction, because of the high risk of ventricular arrhythmias.O6 When ventricular response rate is rapid, pretreatment with esmolol may increase the efficacy of conversion with ibutilide.F11

Theoretical concerns have been raised about using ibutilide (which can be proarrhythmic with prolongation of QT interval) after amiodarone (which also prolongs QT interval but rarely causes torsades). When intravenous amiodarone is

not effective in conversion to sinus rhythm, several studies indicate that ibutilide is frequently successful and reasonably safe.F12,H14 In a study of ICU patients (noncardiac surgical) who were not successfully converted from atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm with amiodarone, 80% were successfully converted with ibutilide.H14 Nonsustained torsades de pointes occurred in 11% of patients, all of whom had depressed LV function. Torsades de pointes has been reported in about 5.5% of women and 3% of men who receive ibutilide.G16 It usually occurs within 45 minutes of completion of ibutilide infusion and resolves without treatment in about 40% of patients. Treatment of more than transient torsades includes intravenous magnesium plus lidocaine or cardioversion if the patient is hemodynamically unstable.G17 Deaths from torsades have rarely been reported in this setting.G16 Similarly, amiodarone can be safely administered if initial treatment with ibutilide fails.D14

Alternatively, in patients in whom atrial fibrillation or flutter is importantly embarrassing circulation, electrical cardioversion is indicated.M15 Using bipolar temporary atrial wires placed at operation (one each on the right atrium and left atrium), low-energy cardioversion techniques have been developed that result in an 80% conversion early postoperatively; anesthesia is unnecessary.L7

When atrial fibrillation persists for more than 48 hours, anticoagulation with heparin or warfarin is indicated for stroke prevention.R5

**Atrial Flutter.** Atrial flutter can be a difficult arrhythmia to control when it occurs postoperatively. Although not always successful, the best treatment is rapid atrial pacing via the two atrial epicardial wires placed at operation (see Appendix 5E).

Ibutilide is also effective in converting atrial flutter (>80% success) and is probably more effective than amiodarone.K1 Ibutilide is also effective in converting atrial flutter in pediatric patients.H29 For patients weighing less than 60 kg, the recommended dose is 0.01 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> intravenously over 10 minutes.

**Paroxysmal Atrial Tachycardia.** Important episodes of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia or paroxysmal atrial contractions occurring after cardiac operations may also be treated by rapid atrial pacing. If these arrhythmias persist, however, the diagnostic and therapeutic advice of an electrophysiologically expert cardiologist is needed. Specific treatment depends on the precise nature of the supraventricular tachycardia. In general, administration of catecholamines should be reduced as much as possible; if additional support is necessary, milrinone is considered (see "Noninvasive Methods" under Treatment of Low Cardiac Output earlier in this section). β-Adrenergic receptor blocking agents such as propranolol are useful (see earlier discussion). Multifocal atrial tachycardias are often best treated by verapamil given intravenously.

*Junctional ectopic tachycardia* (JET) may be a particularly difficult problem in children, with a prevalence of 5% to 8%.D7 It is associated with operations to close VSDs, perioperative transient AV block, repair of AV septal defect,D7 and young age. In 70 of 71 patients with postoperative JET, Walsh and colleagues obtained control of the arrhythmia and hemodynamic stability using a combination of sedation, hypothermia to 34°C, and procainamide.W6 Amiodarone may also be effective.R1

#### PULMONARY SUBSYSTEM

#### Adequacy

#### *During Intubation*

Adequacy of pulmonary function early postoperatively while the patient is still intubated and receiving controlled ventilation is judged by the response of PaO2 and arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO2) to the minute volume of ventilation and ventilating gas mixture being used. The response of the *arterial oxygen levels* can be expressed as the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference, P(A − a)O2, which in intact humans is normally only a few mmHg. Nearly all patients early after cardiac operations have abnormally large alveolar-arterial oxygen differences due to intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting of 3% to 15%.E3,G9,H11 This assumes that no right-to-left intracardiac shunting is present. Response of the *carbon dioxide levels* can be expressed as the minute volume of ventilation required to maintain  $PaCO_2$  at 30 to 45 mmHg. Usually this is about 15 to 20 mL  $\cdot$  kg<sup>-1</sup> in both adults and children.

When anesthesia and heavy sedation are no longer present and the ventilator is in a mode of intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV), the patient's ventilatory rate is a useful guide to the ease with which the respiratory center's needs are met, and thus to the adequacy of pulmonary function. In an adult, a patient-triggered respiratory rate of 8 to 12 breaths · min<sup>-1</sup>, with the usual tidal volume, inspiratory gases, and end-expiratory pressure, indicates adequacy of lung function.

Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may be used as a routine or on indication, with a setting of 5 to 8 cm  $\rm H_2O$  for adults and children older than 12, and 4 cm  $\rm H_2O$  for younger patients. Unless the hemodynamic state is suboptimal, PEEP does not alter it, even in infants. PEEP is used because of studies that suggest it is associated with larger lung volumes, fewer perfused but nonventilated alveoli during ventilation, and smaller  $\rm P(A-a)O_2$  after extubation. PEEP is generally not advisable in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (to avoid air trapping and rupturing a bulla, with consequent pneumothorax) and in infants and children who have undergone a Fontan operation or cavopulmonary anastomosis (to avoid still further elevation of jugular venous pressure; see Chapter 41).

Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)<sup>G18,836</sup> may be used in infants once their cardiovascular state is stable, obviating the need for intermittent positive-pressure breathing (IPPB) and IMV. Should IPPB be required initially, the

infant is transferred to IMV and sometimes to CPAP for several hours before extubation.

#### Extubation

Traditionally, continued intubation after cardiac operations has been recommended to maintain more precise control of cardiopulmonary physiology. However, early extubation may shorten ICU and hospital stay. Therefore, a protocol beginning with anesthesia induction may be designed to expedite awakening and spontaneous breathing.

Once the patient has been extubated, PaCO<sub>2</sub> and PaO<sub>2</sub> levels, as well as the visually estimated work of breathing, are useful indices of pulmonary function. PaCO<sub>2</sub> of less than 45 mmHg in adults, less than 50 mmHg in young children, and less than 55 mmHg in small infants indicates an adequate minute volume of ventilation. Higher values indicate inadequate alveolar ventilation. PaO<sub>2</sub> is often mildly depressed at this time and usually remains so for the first few days after cardiac surgery performed with CPB (Fig. 5-9). This results from the somewhat widened alveolar-arterial oxygen difference. These measurements are valuable, but when a patient is comfortable, breathing easily and slowly, and the chest radiograph is essentially normal, it is highly probable pulmonary function is adequate and convalescence will be satisfactory.

#### Causes of Dysfunction

10

After cardiac surgery with CPB, the lungs are more likely to have dysfunction, albeit mild and transient, than any organ other than the heart itself. This dysfunction has multiple

causes. In part it is caused by absence of pulmonary blood flow during total CPB and by its near absence during partial CPB. Among other things, this results in very low sheer stresses in the pulmonary capillaries. This appears to accentuate neutrophil activation, because neutrophils appear to be exquisitely sensitive to sheer stress. Leukocytes are also activated by the general damaging effects of CPB and incite an inflammatory response in the pulmonary vasculature.C10 During total CPB and lung ischemia, plasma thromboxane B2 increases, and this may contribute to a pulmonary vascular inflammatory response.F14 Cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 increase with CPB and may also contribute to membrane damage and neutrophil activation in the lung.B30,F5 The alveolar-capillary barrier becomes more permeable than normal,B3,G5 and after cardiac surgery using CPB, macromolecules enter the pulmonary interstitium and ultimately the alveoli, promoting development of pulmonary edema. During the early hours after CPB, radioactive albumin injected intravenously can be detected in considerable quantity in fluid aspirated from the tracheobronchial tree (Digerness SB, Kirklin JW: personal communication; 1972). Postoperative disturbances of lung function and increases of alveolar polymorphonuclear leukocytes have been linked to important reduction of pulmonary surfactant activity.M16 In addition, multiple and not yet totally defined factors encourage development of large areas of atelectasis, either segmental or occasionally lobar; in particular, the left lower lobe has a strong tendency to atelectasis, even in patients who are otherwise convalescing normally.T3

In some patients, direct trauma to the lungs occurs and contributes to pulmonary dysfunction. Should secretions be retained during or early after the operation, these also contribute to dysfunction. Left (and occasionally, right) phrenic nerve injury may occur after carefully performed cardiac operations, increasing the tendency to pulmonary dysfunction early postoperatively.R20,S25 However, left lower lobe atelectasis is considerably more common than left phrenic nerve paralysis; Markand and colleagues found the left phrenic nerve to be paralyzed in only 11% of patients experiencing left lower lobe atelectasis early after open heart operations.M6 In most patients, the left phrenic nerve recovers within 6 months from its paralysis.L6 Mechanical obstruction of the lower trachea or the bronchi can produce pulmonary dysfunction that may go unrecognized unless care is taken to identify and treat it.C23 Localized or more extensive pulmonary edema may develop in the presence of low or normal left atrial pressure, no doubt related to changes in pulmonary venular and capillary permeability, the causes of which are only partially understood. This phenomenon seems to be more marked in elderly patients.G3 Less commonly, frank pulmonary hemorrhage developing as CPB is discontinued or early thereafter can cause serious bronchial obstruction and contribute in a major way to pulmonary dysfunction.S27 This is probably a more severe result of the same factors that lead to pulmonary edema in patients with normal or low left atrial pressures.

# Risk Factors for Acute Dysfunction

#### *Patient-Specific*

Patient-specific risk factors for pulmonary dysfunction after cardiac surgery have long been recognized, but formal identification and quantification are rare. In a formal observational study, *young age* at operation was identified as a risk factor, particularly when the patient was younger than about 2 years old (Fig. 5-10). Similar observations were made by Lell and colleagues.L11 Increased risk with young age is associated with the increased tendency of the very young to develop whole body edema after CPB. In the experience of most institutions, and in a study by Gallagher and colleagues, *older age*, particularly older than 60 years, has also been associated with increased prevalence of pulmonary dysfunction after cardiac surgery.G3 *Chronic obstructive lung disease* is an important risk factor for pulmonary dysfunction postoperatively and increases the overall risk of operation because it predisposes patients to increased work of breathing and air trapping.R2 Preoperative *pulmonary arterial hypertension*, even when associated with low pulmonary arteriolar resistance, predisposes infants to pulmonary dysfunction and also to paroxysms of pulmonary arteriolar constriction and pulmonary hypertension early postoperatively (see "Pulmonary Hypertensive Crises" later in this section). Congenital morphometric pulmonary abnormalities like the *alveolar hypoplasia* frequently present in patients with congenital heart disease and *Down syndrome* increase the prevalence of postoperative pulmonary dysfunction.Y1 Some drugs given during the period before operation increase the prevalence of pulmonary complications postoperatively; *amiodarone*, used to control cardiac arrhythmias, has been linked to severe pulmonary dysfunction after cardiac surgery.D22,K12,M9

### *Procedural*

The *type of oxygenator* used is probably related to the amount of pulmonary dysfunction generated by the operation, with oxygenators other than membrane-type being risk factors for pulmonary damage.H21 *Proper filters* in the arterial tubing may reduce pulmonary dysfunction postoperatively.M17 *Longer duration* of CPB is a risk factor. This is probably related in part to the direct correlation between duration of CPB and increase in the patient's extracellular waterC1,C16,P1 (Fig. 5-11). The *amount of C3a* generated by complement activation during CPB is a risk factor for pulmonary dysfunction; this may relate to a greater amount of neutrophil activation with higher levels of C3a.K18 Use of *external cardiac cooling*, particularly by ice slush rather than cold saline, increases the prevalence of left phrenic nerve paralysis, hence the tendency to postoperative pulmonary dysfunction.B12

#### *Postoperative*

Postoperative events can increase the probability of pulmonary dysfunction. Elevated *left atrial pressure*, with consequent elevation of pulmonary capillary and venular pressures, aggravates the tendency toward increased lung water and pulmonary dysfunction. The longer the patient is on a ventilator, the greater the chances of continuing pulmonary dysfunction. *Paralysis of the phrenic nerve* and the consequent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm predispose patients to continuing pulmonary dysfunction, particularly small patients.R20,S25

#### Course of Dysfunction after Cardiac Surgery

Mild pulmonary dysfunction in normally convalescing patients slowly improves without specific therapy except for ambulation and breathing exercises; however, residues of dysfunction may still be present 10 days after operation.R4 Occasionally in the patient who appears to be convalescing normally and is out of the ICU for 3 to 6 days, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea may develop insidiously. This is particularly likely to occur in patients who have marked LV hypertrophy or poor LV function preoperatively, and it may occur even though their left atrial pressure was less than 15 mmHg when last monitored in the ICU. The chest radiograph may have been normal or may have shown evidence of a mild increase in interstitial fluid. Response to diuresis in such a patient is dramatic and, as a rule, terminates the problem. The hypothesis is that fluid that has accumulated in the interstitial spaces throughout the body during and early after CPB returns to the vascular space 24 to 72 hours after operation. Blood volume is thereby increased at a time when the renal response is subnormal, and diuresis and control of blood volume do not follow.C18,P1 In this setting, LV end-diastolic, left atrial, and pulmonary venous pressures rise and symptoms develop. Weight gain and other gross evidence of fluid retention may be absent.

Occasionally, patients who have convalesced without difficulty begin to cough up thick tracheobronchial secretions 48 to 72 hours after operation. Often, seemingly paradoxically, whatever dyspnea and tachypnea may have been present begins to lessen with these events. Presumably at this time, protein-rich fluid that has been in the alveoli and interstitium of the lung since CPB (or soon thereafter) begins to be moved by ciliary action out of the terminal bronchioles and into the larger airways, from which it can be cleared by coughing.

Lung volumes are usually reversibly decreased early after cardiac surgery, particularly vital capacity and total lung volume.E14 This is probably the result of the summed effects of multiple small areas of atelectasis, occasionally left lower lobe collapse, occult pulmonary edema and pleural fluid, and reduced inspiratory efforts.E14 These usually revert to normal within 3 to 6 months.

# Management and Treatment

The goal of treatment of the pulmonary subsystem is the earliest possible return of the patient to extubated spontaneous breathing and ambulation. In an era characterized by the ability to intensively treat both large and small patients after cardiac surgery, the distinctly beneficial effects of early extubation are often forgotten. These include a decline in intrapleural pressure and an increase in LV end-diastolic diameter (or volume), improved ventricular systolic function (due to increased preload associated with shifting of some of the blood volume toward the chest), and improved cardiac output.G1

#### *General Measures*

Patients who are convalescing normally are extubated either in the OR or during the early hours after operation. In most ICUs, it is advisable to extubate patients in the daytime rather than at night; this consideration is a reasonable cause of delay of extubation for a few hours. Otherwise, when pulmonary function is good, extubation should be delayed only under special circumstances, including the presence of cardiac assist devices and the possibility of early reoperation. In general, criteria for extubation include stable and satisfactory cardiac performance, lack of important cardiac arrhythmia, and appropriate awakening with satisfactory neurologic status. There should be no anticipation of return to the OR (e.g., for bleeding) and satisfactory mechanics and ventilatory lung function, as assessed by arterial blood gas analysis and a clinical estimate of inspiratory force and volume. Increasing emphasis has been placed on the advisability of routine extubation of the normally convalescing patient within 6 hours of arrival in the ICU.M36

A major cause of postoperative pulmonary dysfunction is atelectasis and the associated loss of functional alveolar units. Standard prophylactic measures include chest physiotherapy and use of devices to encourage deep inspirations to recruit atelectatic areas. Zarbock and colleagues demonstrated a beneficial effect of prophylactic nasal positive airway pressure at 10 cm H2O for at least 6 hours.Z1

Treatment of patients with pulmonary dysfunction who are still intubated during the early hours after operation is in large part an intensification of the usual management, as effective specific therapy is not available. Fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) is appropriately adjusted upward if P(A − a)O2 is large. Minute volume of respiration (not only measured, but judged visually by excursion of the chest wall) and respiratory rate are adjusted to maintain PaCO2 at about 30 to 35 mmHg. The airway is kept clear by appropriate tracheal suctioning (see "Pulmonary Hypertensive Crises" later in this section for special precautions in neonates and infants). When hemoconcentration develops from leakage of plasma from the intravascular space into the interstitial space of the lungs, and at times into all other organs and the pleural and peritoneal spaces, administration of concentrated serum albumin is helpful in counteracting this trend. Diuretics are useful because they reduce extracellular fluid volume and, in turn, extravascular lung water. During all this, efforts continue to reduce ventilatory support and work toward extubation of the patient (see Appendix 5F). Spontaneous breathing trials and decreasing levels of pressure support appear equally effective in patients who are difficult to wean.M36

# *Prolonged Intubation*

A prolonged period of endotracheal intubation is necessary when:

- Criteria for extubation are not met.
- Neurologic complications are present.
- Severe dysfunction of the cardiac subsystem is present.
- Persistent chest drainage or a residual cardiac defect make early return to the OR likely.

During periods of prolonged ventilation, active decisions are required regarding use of continuous vs. intermittent sedation and neuromuscular blockade, depending on hemodynamic stability, effectiveness of ventilation, and timing of ventilator weaning. Commonly used sedation and paralytic agents are described in Tables 5-4 and 5-5.

When patients are agitated after cardiac surgery, particularly during ventilator weaning, the first priority is evaluating cardiac and pulmonary subsystems to ensure that agitation is not an indicator of important cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction. If these subsystems have satisfactory function, the next level of intervention targets communication with the patient by nursing or physician staff, or both, to allay patient anxiety. When these interventions are insufficient, pharmacologic agents commonly used to alleviate agitation and anxiety in the ICU include benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, lorazepam, midazolam), opioid analgesics (e.g., fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine, remifentanil), propofol, dexmedetomidine, and neuroleptics (e.g., haloperidol).

Prolonged intubation (≥48 hours) entails problems necessitating fastidious care of the patient. A pneumothorax occasionally develops from positive-pressure breathing, usually requiring urgent aspiration and underwater drainage. Bronchospasm may become a particular problem, probably as a reflex response to proteinaceous tracheobronchial fluid often present under these circumstances. Administration of nebulized isoetharine every hour can be helpful. In extreme cases, aminophylline is given as a continuous intravenous infusion in 10% dextrose in a dose of 0.15 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . An initial loading dose of about 4 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> is given over 20 minutes. Neonates, infants, and young children who require intubation and ventilation for more than about 14 days often have phrenic nerve paralysis; in these patients, plication of the hemidiaphragm often permits prompt extubation.V1,W16 Plication usually does not interfere with recovery of phrenic nerve and diaphragmatic function.S38

In those unusual circumstances when intubation in older children and adults is necessary for more than about 10 days, consideration is given to tracheostomy. Both patient comfort and effectiveness of ventilation are thereby usually increased. This procedure has disadvantages but is sometimes helpful in weaning the patient from the ventilator. Tracheostomy is rarely performed in neonates, infants, and young children, because it is difficult to manage in this age group.

May<br>cause extrapyramidal<br>symptoms                                |

### *Reintubation*

When the patient meets all criteria for extubation, reintubation is usually unnecessary. However, reintubation is indicated when:

- PaCO2 rises above 50 mmHg over 4 hours in the absence of appropriate respiratory compensation for metabolic alkalosis.
- Signs of decreasing cardiac output are noted.
- Signs of exhaustion from breathing spontaneously are observed.
- Excessive pulmonary secretions with ineffective coughing are evidenced.

When the situation is borderline, proper management requires careful observation by senior members of the team. Reintubation should be performed by a competent professional.

#### *Pulmonary Hypertensive Crises*

**Description.** *Pulmonary hypertensive crisis* is a phrase used to describe a serious syndrome of hyperacute rise in pulmonary arterial pressure usually accompanied by bronchospasm, often followed within seconds or accompanied by profound reduction in cardiac output and fall in SaO2; these sequelae may be irreversible. The syndrome occurs most commonly, but not exclusively, among neonates and infants who are intubated after an operation for repair of a congenital cardiac defect associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Pulmonary artery pressure is usually essentially normal or mildly elevated after repair, until an episode of pulmonary hypertensive crisis. The crisis may appear spontaneously but usually occurs during or shortly after endotracheal tube suctioning, particularly if the endotracheal tube is too far down the trachea and makes contact with the carina. Multiple crises may occur in a single patient. The prevalence of pulmonary hypertensive crises is greatest about 18 hours after operation, but they can occur before or after that time.H28 During an acute hypertensive crisis, atypical cardiac tamponade can result from acute RV dilatation.D8,K11

**Incremental Risk Factors.** Although recognized for many years, its precise cause at the time it occurs is unknown.D1,J7,W22 Congenital cardiac defects accompanied by large pulmonary blood flow and relatively low pulmonary vascular resistance are strong *patient risk factors* for their development. Chief among them are truncus arteriosus and AV septal defect. The histology of the pulmonary arteries and arterioles is normal or mildly abnormal, with all changes considered to be clearly reversible.H28 The syndrome is not seen in patients with fixed pulmonary hypertension or severe pulmonary vascular disease. *Procedural risk factors* have not been clearly identified, although absence of pulmonary blood flow during CPB, accumulation of neutrophils in the lung, and damage to pulmonary endothelial cells are known to occur and provide a favorable setting for development of pulmonary hypertensive crises. Release of arachidonic metabolites from some cells in the lung (probably pulmonary endothelial cells),V5 failure of pulmonary endothelial cells to inactivate bradykinin,S1 and release by injured pulmonary endothelial cells of the vasoconstrictive platelet-activating factorR21 are probably all encouraged by events during CPB, perhaps particularly if these cells were preconditioned before operation by a high pulmonary blood flow. *Postoperative risk factors* nearly certainly include acute hypoxia, which is known to produce acute hypoxic vasoconstriction, probably using some of the mechanisms just described.C34,S32 Catecholamine administration appears to predispose patients to these crises.

**Prevention.** Because pulmonary hypertensive crisis may be fatal despite intense therapy, its prevention is critical. An important preventive measure in neonates and infants is maintenance of paralysis and sedation (with pancuronium [or a similar agent] and fentanyl) for at least the first 20 to 24 postoperative hours, and for at least another 24 hours or longer if the patient remains intubated (see Section IV, "General Care of Neonates and Infants," later in this chapter). Fentanyl has been shown to be a safe agent in neonates and adults, with little adverse effect on cardiac function or systemic and pulmonary circulations.H16 A paralytic agent (see Table 5-4) is given along with fentanyl to prevent rigidity. Fentanyl (in a dose of 25 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), along with pancuronium, should be given before suctioning the endotracheal tube in any neonate or infant who is not already well paralyzed and sedated, because it appears to minimize the possibility of a pulmonary hypertensive crisis. In addition to sedation, aggressive treatment of acidosis, including hyperventilation to PCO2 = 30 to 34 mmHg, decreases prevalence and severity of pulmonary hypertensive crises. When the monitored pulmonary artery pressure becomes paroxysmally elevated early postoperatively, efforts are made to control and reduce it. A high FIO2 is maintained because this is as useful an agent as exists for reducing pulmonary vascular resistance. Direct infusion of nitroprusside into the pulmonary artery has also been useful. Many agents have been advanced as being optimal on the grounds that they selectively reduce pulmonary vascular resistance, but few do so, and no clearly superior one has been identified.J7

There are encouraging results from use of inhaled nitric oxide to reduce pulmonary artery pressure in cardiac transplant recipients,K13 patients on LV assist devices,A13 and generally in infants and children prone to pulmonary hypertensive crises.B9 Journis and colleaguesJ9 found that 15 of 17 children having critical pulmonary hypertension following operation for congenital heart disease responded to inhaled nitric oxide (20 ppm) after failure of conventional medical treatment (Table 5-6). Pulmonary arterial pressure decreased without a change in systemic arterial pressure but with concomitant increase of SaO2 and SvO2 . Other investigators have also

# RENAL SUBSYSTEM

#### Adequacy

As a guide to the continuing evaluation of the renal subsystem, a urinary catheter is inserted preoperatively in the OR and left for a minimum of 48 hours to monitor hourly urine flow. In some cases, consideration should be given to use of a trocar-introduced suprapubic catheter in adults, rather than a urethral catheter, because this type of catheter is more comfortable, easier to manage, and associated with less urinary tract infection.I1 Serum potassium concentration is measured every 4 hours during the first 24 postoperative hours and, if the patient is still in the ICU, every 8 hours for at least the next 48 hours. Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels are measured each morning for at least the first 48 hours.

Convalescence early after cardiac surgery can, arbitrarily, be considered adequate with regard to urine flow when urine volume is greater than 500 mL · 24 h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , or 167 mL · 8 h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , or 20 mL · 1 h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> . Some prefer to use the criterion of 0.5 to 1 mL h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in the case of infants and small children.

In most postoperative patients, CPB induces a diuresis early after operation. Factors responsible for this are hemodilution with a clear fluid prime (lactated Ringer solution, D5W + <sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup> normal saline, or Plasmalyte A), and often glucose and mannitol additions to increase tubular oncotic load. Low cardiac output therefore can exist early postoperatively even in the presence of nominally adequate urine flow. Renal function is inadequate when solute excretion is insufficient to keep serum potassium below 5 mEq  $\cdot$  L $^{-1}$ , BUN below 40 mg  $\cdot$  dL $^{-1}$ , and creatinine below 1.0 mg  $\cdot$  dL $^{-1}$ . Convalescence cannot be considered normal when urine is pink but without red blood cells early postoperatively, because this indicates a free plasma hemoglobin greater than 40 mg  $\cdot$  dL $^{-1}$  and an inordinate and potentially dangerous amount of hemolysis.

Acute renal failure requiring dialysis is rare in adults, <sup>M5</sup> but postoperative renal dysfunction (doubling or greater of serum creatinine) occurs in approximately 1% of adult patients if preoperative renal function is normal. If any degree of renal dysfunction is present preoperatively, it occurs in 16% to 20% of patients, about one fifth of whom will need dialysis. Acute renal failure occurred in less than 3% of children undergoing open intracardiac operation. <sup>P16</sup> Acute renal failure (in patients without preexisting renal disease) after cardiac surgery is nearly always associated with low cardiac output, but rarely may occur when the other criteria of cardiac subsystem performance are satisfactory. <sup>B21,H20</sup>

# Causes of Acute Dysfunction after Cardiac Surgery

There are no usual intraoperative events during wellconducted cardiac operations that are damaging to renal function and can be considered causes of acute renal failure.

# Risk Factors for Acute Dysfunction

# Patient-Specific

*Preoperative impairment of renal function* that is intractable to therapy considerably increases the risk of acute renal failure early postoperatively. H20 Therefore, preoperative evaluation includes assessment of renal function.

The predictive value of serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) on the risk of postoperative dialysis has been quantified by Mehta and colleagues<sup>M19</sup> for adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery (Fig. 5-12). Although traditionally GFR is the standard measure of renal function, its formal measurement is frequently not feasible in the clinical setting. A useful approximation of creatinine clearance can be made with the Cockcroft-Gault equation<sup>C17,W23</sup>:

$$Cr Clearance = \frac{(140 - age \times lean body weight [kg])}{Cr (mg \cdot dL^{-1}) \times 72}$$

where Cr = creatinine. For women, multiply the result by 0.85 to account for smaller muscle mass.

Chronic heart failure (preoperative NYHA class IV) considerably increases risk of acute renal failure after operation, as does cyanotic heart disease after cardiac surgery in older patients. The A renal lesion is known to exist preoperatively in many such patients. This does not appear to be the case in young patients; for example, renal failure is rare in infants and children undergoing repair of tetralogy of Fallot. K21

*Young age* is a risk factor for acute renal failure. When cardiac output is importantly reduced after cardiac surgery in neonates and infants, a prevalence of acute renal failure as high as 8% to 10% has been reported<sup>H4,R8</sup> (Srinivasan and colleagues: personal communication; 1981). One reason for this apparently increased prevalence may be that immature kidneys have less ability to concentrate urine in the face of

**Figure 5-12** Risk of dialysis after cardiac surgery based on preoperative serum creatinine **(A)** or glomerular filtration rate (GFR; **B**). Each data point may represent more than one patient with same serum creatinine or GFR value. (From Mehta and colleagues.<sup>M19</sup>)

reduced renal blood flow. Compared with older patients, infants may develop more tissue hypoxia during and early after CPB, with a resulting increase in production of potassium, BUN, and other substances, some of which may be nephrotoxic. Uric acid levels, for example, were shown by Hencz and colleagues to rise to nephrotoxic levels ( $10~{\rm mg} \cdot {\rm dL}^{-1}$ ) in some patients within 24 hours of operation, and the levels were higher (P= .001) in patients younger than 3 years of age than in older children. At the other end of the spectrum, *older age* (>70 years) is a risk factor for developing acute renal failure. L12

Obesity has also been identified as a risk factor for postoperative acute renal failure.  $^{\rm V4}$ 

#### Procedural

A *long period of CPB* increases the risk of acute renal failure. R8 This has been demonstrated by a prospective study and is probably in part related to the damaging effects of CPB. There is an additional risk imposed by a longer duration of hypothermic circulatory arrest, particularly in infants and children. However, a CPB flow of 1.6 L·min<sup>-1</sup> (at body temperatures of 28°C or higher) with a mean arterial blood pressure of at least 30 mmHg seems to minimize occurrence of acute renal failure when postoperative cardiac output is good. H20

Several studies suggest that using a CPB prime of *whole blood* (rather than hemodilution) increases the risk of acute renal failure,G7,W24 as does *high plasma hemoglobin level* (>40 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) during and early after CPB.

# *Postoperative*

*Acute reduction in cardiac output* early after operation is the most common and most important risk factor for developing acute renal failure. Yet the prevalence of acute renal failure varies among patients with low cardiac output, in part because of the role played by other risk factors. Picca and colleaguesP16 found a 79% mortality in children developing acute renal failure. High central venous pressure, low systemic blood pressure, and high dosage of dopamine or epinephrine, each associated with low cardiac output, were risk factors.P16

Aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin) and some other *antibiotics* increase risk of acute renal dysfunction early after operation.

# Course of Dysfunction

Acute renal failure is rarely evident immediately after operation, but becomes evident 12 to 18 hours later. Its first manifestation, particularly in infants and children, is usually oliguria of increasing severity that is resistant to measures to increase cardiac output, to dopamine, and to furosemide. Oliguria is soon accompanied by a rapid rise in serum potassium concentration (probably due to acute release of potassium from hemolyzing red blood cells and other intracellular stores of potassium) and a slower rise in BUN and creatinine. Although this form of acute renal failure is rarely the primary mode of death, it is a major contributor without prompt and effective interventions. In patients who survive, and particularly in young patients, renal function usually begins to improve as cardiac output rises, and important residual renal dysfunction rarely remains.

By contrast, a less lethal form of renal dysfunction, usually occurring in adults, becomes apparent on the third or fourth postoperative day. It presents as a progressive rise in BUN and creatinine levels, which usually peak at 80 to 120 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and 5 to 8 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , respectively, about 7 to 10 days postoperatively. Oliguria is often absent, and hyperkalemia greater than 5 mEq · L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> usually does not develop. Spontaneous resolution occurs in about 75% of patients.C24

Acute renal failure (as opposed to dysfunction) after cardiac operations, treated or otherwise, is associated with subsequent hospital death in about 50% of patients.L4 Probability of death in patients with acute renal failure severe enough to require dialysis is increased by coexistence of cardiac and pulmonary subsystem dysfunction. Development of infection after the beginning of dialysis is also an important risk factor for death.

### Management and Treatment

One important aspect of managing the renal subsystem is a reasonable program of fluid administration (see "Fluid, Electrolyte, and Caloric Intake" in Section II of this chapter) early after open cardiac operations. Its purpose in part is avoidance of fluid overload that can easily develop with even mild impairment of renal function. There is no evidence that larger amounts of fluids reduce the prevalence of acute renal failure in this setting. Maintaining good function in other subsystems, particularly cardiac, is a second important aspect of managing the renal subsystem after cardiac surgery.

When oliguria occurs early postoperatively, cardiac preload and afterload are optimized, and administration of dopamine at 2.5 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> is begun (see Appendix 5G). The direct diuretic effect of low-dose dopamine and its subsequent prevention of oliguric renal failure are controversial.C26 At best, dopamine may increase cardiac output, blood pressure, or both, resulting in greater urine volume, but its therapeutic effect on GFR, creatinine clearance, and serum creatinine is doubtful,D5,H19 particularly in high-risk patients.D10 If these measures do not quickly suffice, furosemide (1 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> or up to 40 mg in adults) is administered intravenously. If a good response is obtained, this dosage is repeated every 6 to 12 hours for 3 days. If a response is not obtained within 30 to 60 minutes, the dose is doubled and then quadrupled, and then 8 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> is given. Because of the propensity for increasing osmolarity with mannitol, an alternative recommendation is a pure furosemide infusion at a dose of 1 to 15 mg · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in adults and 0.1 to 0.5 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in infants and children. This technique produces a more consistent urine output, often with a smaller total dose of furosemide than intermittent furosemide administration. This therapy is based on the reasonable hypothesis that maintenance of urine production, even though dilute, is advantageous to renal function. When serum potassium rises above 5.5 mEq · L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , a glucose and insulin solution is given intravenously, and sodium polystyrene sulfonate enemas are usedW25 (see Appendix 5H). These are temporary palliative measures to be used until dialysis can be initiated.

Alternatively, when urine flow does not respond to the first few doses of the furosemide schedule, infusion of a "renal cocktail" may be effective. This consists of a mixture of 400 mg of furosemide in 100 mL of 20% mannitol (both amounts are halved for small patients); it is administered continuously at a furosemide rate of 1 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . During infusion of the renal cocktail, the serum osmolarity of the patient is measured every 2 to 4 hours; if it exceeds 310 mOsm · L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , the infusion is immediately discontinued. Otherwise, it is administered for 4 hours, discontinued for 4 hours, then administered for another 4 hours, and so forth. If a large urine flow develops, the "cocktail" is usually discontinued after 24 hours, or after 3000 mL of urine (in an adult) has been excreted. If a large urine flow does not develop within about 2 hours of beginning this infusion, it is stopped. Occasionally in the absence of a diuretic response to furosemide, intravenous ethacrynic acid (100 mg for an adult) may be effective.

Unless oliguria and hyperkalemia respond to treatment within a few hours, especially in neonates and infants, a considerable probability of death exists.C24,H20,M5,R8 Therefore, peritoneal dialysis or continuous arteriovenous hemodialysisP7 is initiated on an emergency basis; the urgency is in part due to the frequent coexistence of an increased extracellular fluid volume ("fluid overload") dating back to the time of CPB. More optimally, preventive measures are applied earlier, including (1) ultrafiltration during the closing phases of CPB (see "Components" under Pump-Oxygenator in Section III of Chapter 2)M1,N2; (2) limitation of fluid administration during the early hours after operation; and (3) routine placement, in neonates and infants, of a small silicone peritoneal dialysis catheter through the lower end of the incision used for the median sternotomy. The advantages of this last technique have been developed and emphasized by Mee.M18 His protocol includes using the catheter simply as a drain initially; occasionally the tube drains large amounts of peritoneal fluid with a protein content similar to that of plasma. Should oliguria develop that is unresponsive to furosemide, or should serum potassium rise above 5 mEq · L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , rapidcycle low-volume peritoneal dialysis is recommended. Dialysates, alternatively isotonic and hypertonic, are used in volumes of 10 mL · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . Potassium content depends on serum potassium concentration. Particularly in neonates, infants, and children, dialysis by this or other techniques usually improves cardiac performance and decreases ventilatory requirements.M18,Z2 Complications of such protocols are rare; the most frequent error in their use is delay in beginning intervention.B20,H4,N14,R8,W21 At least one study has demonstrated beneficial effects of prophylactic peritoneal dialysis in neonates and infants after complex cardiac operations.A7

In older children and in adults, who more commonly develop nonoliguric renal failure,S40 conventional hemodialysis may be appropriate when indicated. However, continuous pumped or unpumped arteriovenous or venovenous hemofiltration is the technique preferred in this setting, with the unpumped technique having advantages in patients who are hemodynamically unstable.B6,M28

# NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL SUBSYSTEM

Neuropsychological symptoms and signs after cardiac surgery are difficult to categorize, arguable as to etiology, and often overlooked. Literature concerning them is voluminous, and inferences from the available information are controversial.B28

The neuropsychological sequelae of hypothermic circulatory arrest are described separately in "Brain Function and Structure: Risk Factors for Damage" and "Effects of Brain Damage" under Damaging Effects of Circulatory Arrest during Hypothermia in Section I of Chapter 2. (For a discussion of the emergency treatment of seizures, one sequela of hypothermic circulatory arrest, see Appendix 5I.)

#### Generalized (Diffuse) Neuropsychological Function

Intelligence, problem-solving, concentration, learning, memory, error-free performance, and dexterity are components of the general neuropsychological subsystem, and all or some of these have been included in the term *cognitive functions.* It is believed that changes in these cognitive functions reflect genuine disturbances in the brain and are testable, usually by psychometric study.

#### *Adequacy*

Concentration, memory, learning, and speed of visuomotor responses have been reported to be adequate early postoperatively in less than half of patients who undergo cardiac surgery with CPB.N7,S14,S15 However, in many patients this inadequacy (or decrease in function) is only mild (and presumably transient); in about 20% of patients it is moderate in severity, and in 5% it is severe.S14 By contrast, after peripheral vascular surgery, mild inadequacy is present in 30% of patients, and moderate or severe disturbances in none.S14 These findings have been disputed, however, and the early prevalences remain uncertain.H3,M25,R12,S26 By 8 weeks after operation, at least 60% of patients have adequate (normal) cognitive functions. Six months to 5 years after operation, more than 80% of patients have adequate (normal) function of this subsystem,S31 although Newman and colleagues observed an increase in cognitive decline between 6 months and 5 years.N6

These estimates from objective testing of patients after open cardiac operations have seemed incompatible with the general experience of many physicians and surgeons. The general experience is that patients are not commonly disabled by neuropsychological problems unless they have experienced an overt stroke.O1,T10 In no instance among a carefully studied group of 165 patients was neuropsychological dysfunction sufficient to prevent return to work.S15

### *Causes of Dysfunction*

Presumably, organic changes in the brain cause disturbances of the general neuropsychological subsystem. Embolization and hypoperfusion, with resultant ischemia, have most generally been considered etiologic to these organic changes. Additional studies have also implicated the inflammatory response to CPB and genetic susceptibility as additional contributors to neuropsychological dysfunction.G4 In adults randomized to either pH-stat or alpha-stat acid-base management during CPB, cerebral blood flow was greater using the pH-stat strategy. However, patients with higher cerebral blood flow suffered greater postoperative neurophysiological impairment, suggesting that hyperemia as well as hypoperfusion may be factors in postoperative cerebral dysfunction.P11 Speculatively, the causes of both general neuropsychological subsystem dysfunction and localized subsystem dysfunction (e.g., stroke) are the same except in degree, distribution, or both.

Emotions and moods of patients appear to be causally related to cognitive function. For example, patients who sense cognitive deterioration after CPB usually are not found to have it by objective testing; instead, they are found to have more depression postoperatively than preoperatively.N8 Also, preoperative depression and lower socioeconomic status appear to appreciably increase risk of deterioration of cognitive function postoperatively.F8 In a study of patients randomized to either coronary angioplasty or surgical revascularization, cognitive function was similar in each group after 5 years of follow-up, suggesting no lasting detrimental effect of CPB,H23 a finding contrary to that of Newman and colleagues.N6

### *Risk Factors for Acute Dysfunction*

Knowledge in this area remains incomplete, in part because of difficulty in defining and measuring the endpoints of acute dysfunction, as well as the variables that are possible risk factors for development of dysfunction. *Older age* at operation is a mild risk factor for diffuse neuropsychological dysfunction postoperatively.H7 Mild or moderate carotid artery stenosis is not a risk factor.H7 *Longer duration of CPB* has been found to be a risk factor for general neuropsychological disturbances after the cardiac operation,N7,N9,S6,S26 as has a *greater amount of microembolization*, both particulate and gaseous.B17,P20 Normothermic CPB (used in combination with warm myocardial management) was noted by one group to have a comparatively higher occurrence of central neurologic system events than standard hypothermic perfusion.C29 However, other studies have not corroborated these findings.R6 Engelman and colleaguesE4 performed a randomized study to evaluate the effect of perfusion temperature on prevalence of postoperative neurologic dysfunction; 291 patients were divided among perfusion temperatures of 20°, 32°, and 37°C. In the group as a whole, there was a 36% prevalence of neurologic dysfunction at 1 month postoperatively but no difference in cognitive function, elemental skills, or neurologic functional capacity among the groups. Aside from that for pH-stat regulation, no other correlation has been found between total cerebral blood flow during CPB and prevalence of general neuropsychological dysfunction after operation.V3 *Oxygenators other than the membrane type* and *absence of 40-µm arterial blood filtration* somewhat increase the risk of this type of dysfunction.B16

# *Course of Dysfunction*

As indicated earlier, the prevalence of general neuropsychological dysfunction declines considerably as time passes after the operation.

### *Management and Treatment*

Management and treatment involve prevention and intelligent counseling and reassurance. The former consists of further improvements in CPB and techniques of cardiac operations. The latter is highly important in determining the final overall result of the operation, because perceived continuing dysfunction can limit quality of life. For example, Bhudia and colleagues performed a randomized clinical trial of 350 adults to evaluate magnesium as a neuroprotectant during CPB (780 mg MgSO4 in 100 mL normal saline intravenously over 15 minutes during anesthesia induction, followed by 3160 mg in 100 mL normal saline over 24 hours; the CPB circuit was primed with MgSO4 to a concentration of 3.6 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ).B15 Magnesium was found to preserve short-term memory and cortical control over brainstem functions (primitive reflexes).

#### Mood State

# *Adequacy*

An adequate mood state after a cardiac operation is one without unusual anxiety, depression or euphoria, or delirium. Prevalence of an inadequate mood state has received little study, for reasons similar to those in the case of the general neuropsychological subsystem. In one study of 759 patients undergoing CABG, 7% showed transient confusion without delirium, and in no case did delirium develop thereafter.C1

## *Causes and Risk Factors for Acute Dysfunction*

Preoperative emotional characteristics of the patient play a major role in postoperative mood state. In a study performed during the early era of open cardiac operations, Burgess and colleagues found all patients to have acute preoperative anxiety in varying degrees; a few were frankly depressed. Absence of daily access to an empathetic individual who is not part of the surgical team, both before and after operation, was an important risk factor for increased anxiety and depression postoperatively. These mood states were particularly apparent in the ICU and during the first few days thereafter.

#### *Course of Dysfunction*

Most patients have some degree of anxiety during the first few postoperative days, and severe delirium occurs in 2% to 10%; 10% to 20% of patients have hallucinations and frightening dreams late postoperatively, and 10% to 20% of patients may continue to have episodic alterations in mood state after hospital discharge. In some patients, this seems to be related to difficulty in adjusting to the situational demands of life with improved cardiac function.

### *Management and Treatment*

Daily access to an empathetic individual not identified with the surgical team, and attention to the patient as a sensitive and threatened human being by physicians, are the most important methods of prevention. When the mood state becomes severely abnormal, psychiatric assistance is required.

# Localized Neuropsychological Function

#### *Adequacy*

Most patients recover from open cardiac operations without gross localized neuropsychological subsystem dysfunction (e.g., hemipareses, hemiplegias), and in them the subsystem performs adequately throughout convalescence. Subtle defects occur more frequently. Visual field defects are sometimes perceived by the patient and confirmed by testing, and then usually regress or disappear.S26 Difficulty focusing, such as is required for reading, is sometimes experienced in the early postoperative period, but it usually disappears within 2 weeks. Disturbances of memory are nearly always transient but may be noticeable to the patient. Because of the known phenomenon of accentuation and prolongation of the patient's perception of the abnormality by fixation on it, patients and their families are provided supportive care and reassurance. Special diagnostic procedures are rarely indicated, because there is essentially no effective specific therapy (see "Management" later in this section).

Gross neurologic defects, usually hemipareses or hemiplegias, are less common than neuropsychological and mood abnormalities, but they are generally more serious. Prevalence of these abnormalities after open cardiac operations is about 0.5% in relatively young patients, gradually rising with increasing age to around 5% in patients older than about 65, and 8% in those 75 or older.C25,G6 In a study of 2108 patients undergoing isolated CABG, adverse cerebral outcomes occurred in 129 (6.1%). Approximately half of these were major deficits; the remainder had deterioration of intellectual function or seizures.R9 In a related multicenter study of 271 patients undergoing CABG combined with an intracardiac procedure, adverse cerebral outcomes occurred in 43 (16%).W28

#### *Causes and Risk Factors for Acute Dysfunction*

These defects probably represent more severe forms of the same kinds of damage (i.e., greater quantities, more sensitive locations) that cause neuropsychological and mood disturbances. Thus, they are probably the result of emboli (e.g., platelet aggregates, clusters of microbubbles, aggregates of fibrin accumulations from pump-oxygenators or tubing surfaces, boluses of air, arteriosclerotic debris or plaques dislodged from the ascending aorta) and other facets of the damaging effects of CPB. When investigated using computed tomography (CT) scans in patients with evidence of stroke after cardiac operations, the defects are typically multiple and posteriorly located in the brain. These findings are most consistent with particulate atheromatous embolization.

*Older age* is a risk factor for stroke after cardiac operations such as CABG, but this may be only because of the increased prevalence of arteriosclerosis.B18,W7 *Severe arteriosclerosis of the ascending aorta* clearly increases risk of perioperative stroke, as does known preexisting cerebral vascular disease.G6 *Duration of CPB* and *low cardiac output after operation* also appear to be risk factors.G6,K9 Cardiac microbubbles identified by intraoperative TEE have not been a risk factor for diffuse or localized neuropsychological dysfunction; furthermore, such microbubbles can rarely be eradicated by what might appear to be effective surgical maneuvers.T9

# *Management*

Precise recommendations for complete prevention of localized neurologic dysfunction remain elusive. However, certain precautions may reduce the frequency of major neurologic events, such as maintaining adequate perfusion pressure, minimizing duration of circulatory arrest, and using blood filters and appropriate de-airing procedures (see Chapter 2). In adults, Blauth and colleaguesB18 and Wareing and colleaguesW7 have stressed the importance of ascending aortic atheromatous disease as etiologic in postoperative stroke. Perioperative detection of severe atheromatous disease of the ascending aorta is facilitated by ultrasonographic interrogation by the surgeon.D4 Management may consist of (1) modification of the techniques of aortic cannulation or aortic clamping, (2) aortic endarterectomy or resection, (3) grafting of the ascending aorta, and (4) use of an intraaortic filter at the time of aortic clamp removal.H5,K31,V6

The only general therapeutic intervention that seems to be of value is use of hyperbaric oxygenation. This has been demonstrated only in patients with massive air embolization, but even in this setting, evaluation is difficult because spontaneous recovery may occur. The interval from the embolic event (which nearly always occurs in the OR and usually during or at the end of CPB) to hyperbaric therapy plays a major role in outcome; beyond 12 to 24 hours, this therapy probably is not useful.A14,L5,L8 Because these patients, as well as many others without these localized neurologic disorders, are intubated and heavily sedated during this period, localized neuropsychological disturbances are rarely discovered within 24 hours of operation.K8 Intense diagnostic efforts, such as lumbar puncture and CT scanning, are generally not indicated in the absence of any therapeutic implication. In addition, CT scanning may fail to be diagnostic.A14

Moazami and colleagues have reported the safety and efficacy of intraarterial thrombolysis in a group of 13 patients suffering strokes after cardiac operations.M26 A "stroke" team is organized to evaluate all patients with an acute neurologic deficit recognized within 6 hours of operation. Patients with a clinically important stroke (National Institutes of Health [NIH] stroke scale > 10) or isolated disabling symptoms are considered for study. They undergo emergent contrast cranial CT; evidence of hemorrhage or major early signs of infarction preclude thrombolytic therapy. Otherwise, four-vessel arterial angiography is performed using the transfemoral approach. Digital subtraction angiography permits the site of occlusions to be located and collateral circulation evaluated. Patients with middle cerebral, internal carotid, or basilar artery occlusions are considered for thrombolysis. A 2.3F microcatheter is steered to the occlusion by fluoroscopy and embedded within or through the center of the thrombosis. Thrombolysis is attempted at 5- to 10-minute intervals for up to 2 hours. Additional mechanical manipulation of the clot is also used. Among the 13 patients studied, NIH stroke scale improved importantly in 5 (38%; CL 23%-57%) and did not worsen appreciably in the 8 who did not improve.

The prognosis is variable, as is the case with strokes in general. In some patients, the signs and symptoms gradually disappear, whereas in others there is only partial or no recovery from the neurologic defect. At times, the defects are so massive as to be fatal.

# GASTROINTESTINAL SUBSYSTEM

# Adequacy

Abnormalities of function of the gastrointestinal tract, including the liver and pancreas, are not clinically detectable when convalescence after cardiac surgery is normal; oral intake is usually allowed on the morning after operation. Patients who remain intubated are exceptions. In these cases, fluid intake through a nasogastric tube is begun 12 to 24 hours after operation, gradually progressing to a nutritious one. Evidence of abdominal distention, absence of peristalsis, and hyperperistalsis is sought twice daily. If one of these develops, the gastrointestinal system is not adequate, and alimentation is discontinued, investigations are begun, and intravenously administered hyperalimentation is considered.

Patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease should be given 300 mg of cimetidine (or some other histamine H2 receptor antagonist) every 6 hours by mouth or intravenously during the postoperative hospitalization, beginning 6 to 12 hours after operation. Such a program is worthy of consideration as a routine.

# Types of Acute Dysfunction

Acute dysfunction of the gastrointestinal subsystem is uncommon after open cardiac operations, occurring in only about 1% of patients.L10,O8 However, important dysfunction of the gastrointestinal subsystem is followed by death during the period of hospitalization in more than 50% of those patients. Emergency operations are required for some.

# *Gastrointestinal Bleeding*

Gastrointestinal bleeding after open cardiac operations is usually from the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract.K34 The pathology is usually hemorrhagic gastritis or duodenitis.K34,R16 Occasionally, a previously existing duodenal ulcer is the site of bleeding, and rarely, massive bleeding originates in the colon.W19

#### *Acute Cholecystitis*

Acute cholecystitis, when it develops after open cardiac surgery, may be noncalculous, but it produces the same clinical syndrome of severe pain, leukocytosis, and right upper quadrant tenderness as when it develops in other patients.L10 Perhaps because of delay in diagnosis that has been present, mortality among patients who have developed this complication is about 75%.L10

#### *Acute Pancreatitis*

Some evidence of acute pancreatitis is present in about 25% of patients after open cardiac surgery and presents with hyperamylasemia,R3 increased serum lipase, or both. In most cases, the increased level gradually declines, with few if any clinical sequelae. Occasionally (in <5% of patients with elevated amylase) severe pancreatitis develops, with pancreatic abscess or hemorrhagic pancreatitis.C4 Indiscriminate administration of large doses of calcium chloride contributes to development of pancreatic cellular injury after cardiac surgery.C4

#### *Jaundice*

Convalescence may be complicated by jaundice, with about 20% of patients having a serum bilirubin concentration of at least 3 mg · dL after cardiac surgery.C15 Jaundice is moderate or severe (bilirubin concentration > 6 mg · dL) in only about 5% of patients. Severity of preoperative right atrial hypertension, hypoxia during operation, early postoperative hypotension, duration of CPB, and amount of blood transfused perioperatively all increase the probability of postoperative jaundice.C15,M10,M13 Halothane, if used, and duration of CPB may be risk factors.C15

Provided postoperative cardiac output is good, hepatic dysfunction can be expected to improve gradually and disappear, but when cardiac output is low, prognosis is poor. Frank hepatic necrosis may develop when cardiac output is acutely and severely reduced. The only useful treatment is that directed at improving cardiac performance and supplying adequate nutritional support.

# *Intestinal Necrosis*

Intestinal necrosis develops uncommonly but insidiously after cardiac operations. Inevitable perforation in the area of necrosis may be overlooked for a number of days because of the multiplicity of problems associated with the causative low cardiac output.

# *Esophagitis*

Esophagitis, when it occurs after a cardiac operation, manifests with dysphagia, which is uncommon. Esophagitis may be related to an intrapericardial accumulation of blood or to pericarditis. When oral candidiasis is present, *Candida* esophagitis is nearly certainly the cause of dysphagiaG21 and can be diagnosed by means of esophagoscopy or radiologic study of the barium-filled esophagus.O7 When candidal esophagitis appears, antibiotic therapy is stopped unless it is essential. Every 2 to 6 hours, 500,000 to 1 million units of nystatin are given orally, preferably in methylcellulose to increase viscosity.G22 Treatment is continued for 1 to 3 weeks.

# *Watery Diarrhea*

As a complication of cardiac surgery, watery diarrhea may accompany or follow abdominal distention or appear de novo toward the end of the first week. Should it become frequent and explosive, with passage of mucus and blood, it has ominous implications. Any oral antibiotics should be discontinued when diarrhea develops. The diarrhea may be caused by ischemia of the bowel secondary to a long period of low cardiac output, and this ischemia may lead to small or large bowel infarction,A5 or it may be a form of ulcerative colitis and proctitis. Diagnosis can be made by sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy. If the bowel ischemia and ulceration progress, laparotomy and bowel resection are required, but even with such treatment, prognosis is poor.

An important and potentially serious cause of watery diarrhea after cardiac surgery is *Clostridium difficile*, which colonizes the intestinal tract after the normal gut flora has been altered by broad-spectrum antibiotics. Prevalence of this complication is 0.7% to 1%.C28 Risk factors for development of *C. difficile*–associated diarrhea include advanced age, greater cumulative antibiotic days, longer ICU stay, and longer time on ventilator.C28 *C. difficile* is also the causative organism for antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis. Both pediatric and adult patients who develop watery or persistent diarrhea after cardiac surgery should promptly have a stool specimen examined via a stool toxin assay. If the stool is positive for *C. difficile* toxin, standard therapy is oral metronidazole (alternatively, oral vancomycin) for 14 days, which is usually curative.

# *Abdominal Distention*

Occasionally, gas in the gastrointestinal tract produces abdominal distention within 24 to 48 hours of operation. Bowel sounds can be heard initially. Although not part of normal convalescence, this complication is usually benign and subsides after another day or so in response to fasting, use of glycerin suppositories, and application of heat to the abdomen. A rectal examination should be performed to exclude fecal impaction as a possible cause of distention. If distention does not promptly subside, other causes must be considered; it could be due to oral administration of procainamide or cephalosporins, and these drugs may have to be administered by another route. Mediastinitis and an infected median sternotomy incision may be causative and should be investigated. Abdominal distention may be the first sign of postoperative acute pancreatitis. When combined with marked weakness and fever, particularly in a patient on warfarin, postoperative adrenal insufficiency must be excluded by appropriate tests as a possible cause.

# Causes of Acute Dysfunction

Nearly all acute intraabdominal dysfunctions (inadequacies of the gastrointestinal subsystem) result from localized or generalized severe hypoperfusion of either the gastrointestinal tract or the liver, or both.B1,K34,L10,M13,R16,W19 However, in neonates and infants, improper position of the inferior vena cava cannula during CPB and thrombosis or infection in umbilical arterial or venous catheters may cause intraabdominal problems early postoperatively.

## Risk Factors for Acute Dysfunction

Preoperative *peptic ulcer disease* predisposes patients to upper gastrointestinal bleeding after cardiac operations. Other chronic diseases of the intestinal tract also seem to increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications. *Acute necrotizing enteritis* occurring in neonates who were severely acidotic before operation is a risk factor for gastrointestinal dysfunction early postoperatively. *Advanced age* increases the risk of acute dysfunction of the gastrointestinal subsystem after cardiac operations, as does valvar heart disease and congenital heart disease in adults.L10

*Long duration of CPB* as a risk factor is arguable, but most believe it to be one. *Low cardiac output* requiring prolonged catecholamine support and IABP increases the risk of serious intraabdominal complications.L10 Increased prevalence of these complications is also associated with *infection* during the postoperative period, preoperative chronic *renal failure*, and postoperative acute renal dysfunction.O8

# Management and Treatment

Encouragement of normal convalescence is the best protection against gastrointestinal dysfunction. Routine administration of cimetidine or some other histamine H2-receptor antagonist should be considered for any patient at increased risk of gastrointestinal complications.

Once complications appear, their precise nature is determined on an emergency basis, usually by fiberoptic endoscopic examination and with the collaboration of a gastrointestinal specialist. In the absence of massive hemorrhage or gastrointestinal perforation, or both, intense medical treatment rather than surgical intervention is advisable. In the presence of symptoms, however, the possibility of intestinal necrosis must always be entertained, even when symptoms and signs are mild.A5

# ENDOCRINE SUBSYSTEM

Hyperglycemia (in both the OR and ICU) is associated with adverse outcomes after cardiac surgery. Both in diabetics and nondiabetics, serum glucose levels above 200 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> are associated with increased risk for mortality and adverse events.D21 Insulin therapy is advisable in the ICU to avoid marked hyperglycemia. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, continuous insulin infusion is advisable.P10

Few other abnormalities of the endocrine subsystem have been described as postoperative complications of cardiac surgery. An exception is acute adrenal insufficiency, found by Alford and colleagues in 5, or 0.1%, of 4364 patients.A6 Its cause is probably hemorrhagic infarction of the adrenal gland.A6 This can be precipitated by CPB, and the tendency toward it is aggravated by postoperative anticoagulant therapy. Symptoms generally appear between the fourth and tenth postoperative days and consist of abdominal and flank pain, abdominal distention, altered mental status, fever, and occasionally shock. When this diagnosis is suspected, a low serum cortisol level is virtually diagnostic. The diagnosis is also highly likely if the serum cortisol level remains low 60 minutes after administration of 25 units of intravenous or intramuscular adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Later, confirmatory evidence of acute adrenal insufficiency should be obtained.A6 Prompt treatment with intravenous cortisol and saline solutions results in rapid clearing of symptoms. Lifetime oral treatment is indicated subsequently.

Neither hypo- nor hyperthyroidism has been identified as a complication after cardiac surgery with the aid of CPB. However, an important reduction of plasma free triiodothyronine (T3), although not of thyroxine (T4), occurs early after cardiac operations. T3 remains low for at least 24 hours, leading to the suggestion that its administration at that time is associated with an increase in myocardial function and energy stores.N15 Chronic excessive catecholamine stimulation may depress isometric force development in myocardial muscle. Timek and colleaguesT8 found that exogenous T3 may improve myocardial fiber shortening amplitude by accelerating Ca2<sup>+</sup> transients in an in vivo preparation of catecholamine stimulation. There is some clinical evidence that exogenous T3 (0.6 to 0.8 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) may improve cardiac output immediately after CABG in patients with depressed ejection fractionK22 and also in brain-dead organ donors.S2 However, results have varied. When T3 was given to patients expected to have an uneventful course, little change in outcome was noted.S24 When it was given to adult patients undergoing CABG in a randomized study, improvement in cardiac output and a decreased prevalence of myocardial ischemia compared with controls were noted by Mullis-Jansen and colleagues.M33 An increase in cardiac output was also apparent after CABG in patients with depressed LV function.K22

# HEMATOLOGIC SUBSYSTEM

# Adequacy

Function of the hematologic subsystem is assessed in terms of volume of postoperative bleeding, adequacy of clotting, volume restoration, and resistance to infection (see Immune Subsystem later in this section).

# Causes of Acute Dysfunction

Excessive blood loss after CPB may result from a variety of causes, either singly or in combination. A surgical (mechanical) cause must always be suspected. Reoperative procedures, complex procedures, and operations on the aorta are those most frequently associated with a mechanical etiology for bleeding. Often if there is excessive bleeding, it is obvious within the first hour after transfer from the OR. It is persistent but may vary in volume over successive hours, depending on hemodynamic status, coagulation status, and patient position and wakefulness. Surgical bleeding occasionally also presents as a delayed increase in chest drainage following an apparently normal early postoperative course, and this usually demands emergency reexploration. Likely causes include suture line leak, chamber rupture, or (in the case of CABG) graft disruption or mechanical erosion. Occasionally in a patient with a low hourly blood loss persisting over 12 or more hours, a surgical cause is found at reexploration.

Prevalence of reexploration for bleeding varies between 0.5% and 5.0%,L3 depending on institutional criteria and case mix. Moulton and colleaguesM30 identified increased patient age, preoperative renal insufficiency, operation other than CABG, and prolonged bypass time as independent risk factors for reexploration. In their series, the prevalence of reexploration was 4.2% (253/6015), and reexploration was strongly associated with increased operative mortality and morbidity, including sepsis, renal failure, respiratory failure, and atrial arrhythmias. Others report little or no increased mortality and morbidity associated with reoperation for bleeding.K2

Prevalence of bleeding attributable to nonmechanical (nonsurgical) causes is difficult to estimate, because in many instances reexploration results in cessation of bleeding even though no single site or only a minor site of bleeding can be identified.

Disturbances of coagulation may arise from a myriad of causes. It has long been recognized that the damaging effects of CPB and the magnitude of the resulting inflammatory response are related to postoperative blood loss, presumably via cytokine activation, platelet activation and aggregation, and kallikrein stimulation of neutrophils.K14,K18 Platelet abnormalities, both quantitative and qualitative, universally occur during and after CPB. Some consider platelet dysfunction the most common and most important defect of hemostasis in the postoperative period.C31,C36,S3 The qualitative abnormalities include degranulation and membrane fragmentation attributable in part to changes in GPIb and GPIIb/IIIa receptor activity.

During CPB, coagulation factors are depleted by *dilution*, *activation*, and *consumption.* These effects center on activation of thrombin, plasmin, and fibrinogen. Antithrombin (AT) III normally inhibits thrombin and factors IV and V. Heparin leads to anticoagulation by enhancing the thrombininhibiting ability of AT III by a factor of 2000.O5 Heparin also diminishes activation of factors IX and X and cofactors V and VIII. Residual heparin may lead to excessive bleeding by its effect on thrombin. This has also been characterized as *rebound heparin effect*.

The rationale for use of heparin-bonded circuits is based partially on the potential to reduce contact activation inherent in the CPB apparatus.A3,A4,G21 Contact activation is due to vibration, blood/gas interfaces, and pericardial aspiration. Simple exposure of blood to tubing may lead to important fibrinolysis, diffuse intravascular coagulation, and various consumption coagulopathies.

Hypothermia that can impair thromboxane synthesis and suppress platelet aggregation may lead to coagulation defects.D11,R14 Thus, adequate rewarming on CPB is essential. Platelet transfusion, although controversial, may be beneficial.C20 Further prevention of coagulation difficulties involves limitation or reversal of hemodilution, efforts to avoid contact activation of platelets and blood proteins, adequate rewarming, and use of pharmacologic agents, all discussed in Chapter 2.

# Treatment of Bleeding

There are strong reasons to limit or avoid transfusion of blood products in stable patients.B25 The public, patients, and physicians have become aware of the possibility, although small, of disease transmission from transfusion. The current estimated likelihood of contamination with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is 1 in 440,000 to 640,000 screened units of blood. Hepatitis B is estimated to be present in 1 per 63,000 units, and hepatitis C in 1 per 103,000 units.L1,S8 With routine use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing or nucleic acid testing (NAT), the risk of contamination by HIV and hepatitis B will be even less. The possibility of bacterial contamination is probably slightly greater than the figures just mentioned. Hemolytic reactions occur infrequently and are not generally due to human error, but rather to a delayed reaction from previously undetectable antibody that is activated following a series of transfusions. Finally, the estimated cost for the patient of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (RBCs) is U.S. \$250 to \$280, and efforts at cost control suggest prudence in transfusion will help lower overall hospital costs. Recent studies have shown a correlation between blood transfusions and greater risk of mortality, infection, and other adverse events.G10,K23-K28,M34

Strategies to prevent excessive bleeding, or in some cases to treat it, begin with reversal of hypothermia. The importance of remaining on CPB to achieve a core temperature (measured at the tympanic membrane or in the nasopharynx) of 37°C has been stressed elsewhere (Chapter 2). In the ICU, use of warming blankets (or in infants, overhead heaters) supplements this process.

Control of arterial blood pressure using nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, or diazoxide may be helpful. Use of PEEP has been advocated, but its effect on the magnitude of blood loss is controversial. Residual heparin effect or heparin rebound can be diagnosed by a prolonged ACT. Additional protamine can be administered, usually 50 to 75 mg in adults and 5 to 10 mg in children. (There is a remote possibility of a protamine reaction in this setting, which may vary from mild hypotension to anaphylaxis; see "Whole Body Perfusion during Cardiopulmonary Bypass," in Section II of Chapter 2.)

Use of antifibrinolytic agents in the ICU is controversial. Tranexamic acid, ε-aminocaproic acid (EACA), and aprotinin (now unavailable in the United States) are each more effective when given during CPB than after (see Chapter 2). Transfusion therapies include cryoprecipitate, FFP, platelets, and whole blood or packed RBCs.

Each institution may establish different thresholds for transfusion. As an example, whole blood or packed RBCs could be given for hemoglobin under 7.0 g · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , hematocrit under 20%, or SvO2 under 65%. This threshold might be raised to hemoglobin under 10 g · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in severely ill or elderly patients or in those with unstable hemodynamics, because they are unlikely to increase cardiac output in response to acute anemia.

Transfusion of platelets should be considered for patients with a platelet count under 70,000 and excessive bleeding. Similarly, FFP should be administered for an International Normalized Ratio (INR) greater than 1.5 to 1.7 in patients with excessive bleeding and a history of warfarin treatment. Specific treatment with cryoprecipitate, FFP, or other components is indicated in the presence of a consumption coagulopathy reflected by a fibrinogen level less than 200 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , a positive D-dimer assay, or presence of fibrin degradation products.

In recent years, recombinant activated factor VIIa (rFVIIa) has been added to the surgical armamentarium.A2,K6,T2 Originally conceived as therapy for bleeding in patients with hemophilia, rFVIIa promotes hemostasis by increasing generation of thrombin on platelets, producing a more stable fibrin plug that is resistant to fibrinolysis.H12 In the setting of persistent elevation of INR, partial thromboplastin time and/or reduced platelet count/aggregation, rFVIIa has been shown to be effective in treating bleeding associated with postoperative coagulopathy. However, it is expensive (about \$7000 per treatment), and concern remains about possible development of a hypercoagulable state that could induce bypass graft or mechanical valve thrombosis. Acute thrombotic complications have been observed in pediatric patients on ECMO support.A1 Thus, it should not be used in the usual postoperative patient, but is an important adjunct in the setting of ongoing bleeding with severe coagulopathy.

Chest drainage tubes must be properly placed in the OR for them to function well early postoperatively and keep the pericardial and pleural spaces free of blood (see "Positioning Chest Tubes" under Completing Cardiopulmonary Bypass in Section III of Chapter 2). During transport to the ICU, chest tubes are connected to an underwater seal. Once the patient is in the unit, the tubes drain into an initially empty container in which a negative pressure of 40 cm H2O is continuously maintained. Routine "stripping" of the chest tubes by nursing personnel is unnecessary and potentially dangerous, and the technique should be used only for clearing clots. Provisions are made for continuous precise measurement of drainage from the chest tubes; this can be incorporated into

#### **Box 5-1** Indications for Prompt Reoperation for Bleeding

- **1.** Excessive bleeding from the chest tubes, as defined in Table 5-7 for infants and children. Drainage in excess of these criteria means that bleeding will probably continue and reach clearly excessive total amounts (in adults ≥ 1500 mL) within 12 hours. Exceptions to prompt reentry when this criterion is met are rare and are generally limited to patients in whom prolonged efforts at hemostasis have been made already and a bleeding diathesis is present, suture lines are known to be secure, and tamponade is not present.
- **2.** Marked widening of the cardiac silhouette in the portable chest film 8 to 24 hours after operation. Such widening nearly always indicates retention of some clots and blood in the pericardium. Even if the patient's condition is good, elective reoperation and evacuation of blood and clots are usually advisable.
- **3.** Sudden increase (≥300 mL · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in adults) in chest drainage that has been small in the first few postoperative hours. Such an increase usually results from bleeding from an incision in the heart or great arteries.
- **4.** Evidence of acute cardiac tamponade.

an automated care system (see Section V, Automated Care in the Intensive Care Unit). Reinfusion of shed blood is useful in most circumstances (this again can be incorporated into the automated care system), but its lack of fibrinogen and high levels of fibrin degradation products must be recognized (see Appendix 5J and "Blood Conservation" under Special Situations and Controversies in Section III of Chapter 2).G19,H8,S7,T7

When chest drainage is excessive, prompt reoperation for bleeding is indicated. Use of specific quantitative guidelines for reoperation (Box 5-1 and Table 5-7) results in relatively early reoperation for bleeding, and reoperation usually stops excessive bleeding even when no specific bleeding points are found. Advantages of this protocol include prevention of pericardial tamponade, minimization of the administration of homologous blood, and easier management of all subsystems. Nonetheless, cardiac surgeons must consider reoperations to be disadvantageous and devote their skill, time, and patience during the final stages of the operation to preventing it. These can reduce occurrence of reoperations for bleeding to nearly zero.N3

When excessive bleeding continues after a reoperation at which no specific bleeding point is identified, prompt hematologic consultation and specific treatment are indicated. It is easy to regress into the indiscriminate, costly, and sometimes hazardous use of FFP and platelet concentrates and additional doses of protamine. Optimally, specific management protocols are activated by this occurrence and include (1) repeated measurements of ACT and administration of additional protamine only when indicated (see "Heparinization and Later Protamine Administration" under Preparation for Cardiopulmonary Bypass in Section III of Chapter 2); (2) consideration and possibly measurement of excessive fibrinolysis, and use of EACA, although this is best used prophylactically (see "Blood Conservation" under Special Situations and Controversies in Section III of Chapter 2); and (3) consideration of possible platelet dysfunction, depletion, or both, and administration of platelet concentrates.W30

*a* Reoperation is advisable if the patient has bled the amount indicated in any 1 hour (column 1), the lesser amount in column 2 during each of any 2 successive hours, or the still smaller amount (column 3) in each of any 3 successive hours.

Reoperation is advisable if, by the end of the fourth or fifth postoperative hour, the patient has bled in total the amount indicated.

#### Heparin Resistance

Heparin resistance may be encountered at operation. It may result from a congenital defect in the coagulation cascade, but usually is the result of chronic heparin therapy. Diagnosis is made by an ACT less than 480 seconds after administration of a minimum of three times the calculated dose of heparin. It is treated by administration of FFP or, more appropriately, antithrombin III concentrate.

#### Thrombocytopenia

Moderate thrombocytopenia to levels of 100,000 platelets · mL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> is to be expected following CPB. A level of 70,000 platelets · mL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> may meet a threshold for transfusion if there is excessive bleeding. Under ordinary circumstances, platelet counts as just noted are decreased by dilution, destruction, and aggregation. Platelet function is diminished by changes in platelet membrane receptor activity, which includes downregulation of GPIb and GPIIb/IIIa receptors.

### Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immunemediated syndrome that can occur after prior exposure to heparin products. Unfractionated heparin (and to a lesser degree, low-molecular-weight heparin)M8 binds to circulating platelet factor 4 (PF4), which creates a heparin/PF4 complex that is recognized by immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies. The neoepitopes recognized by HIT antibodies are located on PF4 (found in platelet α granules) and are formed by the binding of PF4 to heparin.A8 When IgG antiheparin/PF4 antibody titers are sufficiently elevated, binding of the heparin/PF4/IgG complexes to platelet receptors induces platelet activation and aggregation. *Clinical diagnosis* of HIT syndrome requires presence of antiheparin/PF4 antibodies and a 30% to 50% decrease in platelet count or absolute platelet count of less than about 80,000. HIT syndrome can also be identified by skin lesions or necrosis at the site of heparin injections in the presence of HIT antibodies. The full-blown syndrome (HIT with thrombosis [HITT]) includes additional presence of arterial or venous thrombotic events, most commonly deep vein thrombosis, but can include pulmonary embolism, disseminated intravascular coagulation, stroke, limb ischemia, renal failure, intestinal ischemia, or coronary thrombosis. Mortality of HITT following cardiac surgery exceeds 25%.W5

Laboratory diagnosis, clinical implications, and management strategies remain without consensus, related to several important observations. Of primary importance is the absence of specificity of current serologic testing. The serologic enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) that is commercially available and used in most hospitals is not specific for IgG antibodies (which are responsible for HIT) and does not differentiate among IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies. As a result, this ELISA is very sensitive (>95% of clinical HITT patients have a positive ELISA for antiheparin/PF4 antibodies) but not highly specific (75%-85%).A12 Furthermore, the predictive value of the ELISA is directly related to the strength of the test result, which is measured in optical density (OD) values. Based on a threshold positive OD value of 0.40, Zwicker and colleagues noted a sixfold increase in the likelihood of a thrombotic event in patients with HIT who had an OD > 1.0 compared with those with an OD of 0.4 to 0.99.Z4 When considering all patients with a positive ELISA test (OD > 0.4), 5% or more of patients have evidence of antiheparin/PF4 antibodies before cardiac surgery,B7,S13 and more than 20% are reported to form HIT antibodies following cardiac surgery.P19,T11,W14 The prevalence is somewhat higher with bovine lung heparin than with heparin derived from porcine gut mucosa.W12 Given the low occurrence of clinical HIT after cardiac surgery with heparin (1%-2%),A12 it is not surprising that some studies indicate that positive anti-HIT antibodies preoperatively predict an increased risk of postoperative thrombosis,B13,M14 whereas others show no such relationship.B7,E15,G11,S13

Functional assays measure platelet activation and detect heparin-dependent IgG antibodies capable of binding to and activating the Fc receptors on platelets. Serotonin Release Assay, which measures serotonin release from activated platelets, has high specificity but is not widely available.W10,W15 Thus, immunoassays are the mainstay of current laboratory diagnosis.

HIT syndrome is most likely to occur 5 to 14 days after exposure to heparin during cardiac surgeryW9 and is more likely to occur with repeated or prolonged exposure, including heparin flushes in pressure transducers and prophylactic subcutaneous heparin for preventing deep vein thrombosis. Rarely, HIT presents days to several weeks after hospital discharge.W8,W13 The relationship of falling platelet counts to HIT after cardiac surgery is confounded by the usual decline in platelet count that occurs with hemodilution and platelet aggregation related to CPB. The decreasing platelet count usually reaches its nadir by about the second postoperative day. HIT is uncommon in the first 4 days after cardiac surgery, but is much more likely in the setting of new-onset decreasing platelet count after about postoperative day 4.W11 In this setting, prompt laboratory testing for HIT antibodies is advisable.

Treatment of HIT initially involves prompt discontinuation of unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin. In patients who can tolerate systemic anticoagulation, continuous infusion of a direct thrombin inhibiter (argatroban, bivalirudin, or lepirudin) is advisable with appropriate anticoagulation monitoring. Limbs should be routinely screened for clinically silent deep vein thrombosis. Platelet transfusions should be avoided. This therapy should be continued until the platelet count has substantially recovered and there is resolution of any arterial or venous thrombosis events. Anticoagulation should then be gradually transitioned to oral warfarin therapy, with an overlap of at least 5 days and achieving target INR before discontinuing the direct thrombin inhibitor infusion.W11

In patients who are diagnosed with HIT *before* planned cardiac surgery, elective operations should be delayed until HIT antibody titers are no longer detectable. In most cases, HIT antibodies disappear within 3 to 4 months.W9 If urgent operation is needed, standard heparinization is recommended during CPB,N12,S9,W20,Z3 but a direct thrombin inhibitor is likely preferable for "off-pump" procedures. Although its benefit is unproven, *plasmapheresis* may be a valuable adjunct for patients with positive HIT antibody titers (OD > 1.0) who cannot safely defer operation.B23,P18,W20 Whether a strategy of repeated plasmapheresis treatments until ELISA OD is less than 1.0 is more protective than a single pre- or intraoperative treatmentW20 is unknown. When the ELISA OD is weakly (0.4-0.99) positive, no special pre- or intraoperative therapy is probably necessary. The HIT ELISA should be followed serially after surgery, beginning at 24 to 48 hours. If the OD exceeds 1.0 or platelet count falls with a positive ELISA, early plasmapheresis should be considered until it is deemed safe to begin anticoagulation with a direct thrombin inhibitor.B22

# IMMUNE SUBSYSTEM

Some have suggested that the immune subsystem is mildly depressed for several weeks after CPB. In general, however, specific immunologic responses (in contrast to general responses such as those expressed in the whole body inflammatory response) in nonsensitized patients are weak ones. Interleukin levels are increased after CPB,M7 and someH1 believe this to be responsible for the hyperthermia frequently present early after operation (see "Body Temperature" under Special Considerations after Cardiac Surgery in Section II of this chapter). In adult patients, the number of helper/ inducer T-lymphocyte subsets (CD4<sup>+</sup> ) is decreased after CPB, and suppressor/cytotoxic T cells (CD8<sup>+</sup> ) are elevated. This possible overall depression of the immune response can be modulated by pretreatment with indomethacin and thymopentin.M7 Ultrafiltration, glucosteroids, or lymphocyte depletion may even further complicate the immune response by their salutary effects on the whole body inflammatory response.

# FLUID, ELECTROLYTE, AND CALORIC INTAKE

#### Children and Adults

Because of the increase in extracellular fluid and total exchangeable sodium and the decrease in exchangeable potassium that develop during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB),S11 postoperative fluid administration early after cardiac operations should be precise.P2 Based on pioneering work by Sturtz and colleagues,S39 a standardized approach to fluid administration has been developed that meets the requirements. For approximately 48 hours after operation in children and adults, no sodium is administered, and minimal amounts of water (as 5% glucose in water) are given intravenously (see Appendix 5K). Larger amounts of water are disadvantageous because they result in higher urine volumes and an increased potassium loss if renal function is good, and fluid overload if renal function is impaired. A modest amount of potassium (10 mEq · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> · 24 h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) is given on the day of operation, because large amounts generally are not needed in normally convalescing patients, despite the decrease in total exchangeable potassium; larger amounts simply escape in the urine.B24 During the first 3 postoperative days, hypokalemia is not treated unless it becomes severe (serum potassium level < 3.0 mEq · L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ). Exceptions to this are patients receiving digitalis preparations, in whom serum potassium is kept at 4.0 mEq · L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> or more. In the presence of ventricular ectopic beats, the level is increased to 4.5 to 5.0 mEq · L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> .

Liquids are taken orally a few hours after extubation, and intravenous administration can then cease by the second postoperative day. Ability of the kidneys to excrete sodium may be impaired for some days after operation even in normally convalescing patients,P3,P4 so a diet low in sodium is needed until the patient's weight (measured daily) falls below preoperative level.

When extubation is delayed beyond the second postoperative day, adequate caloric intake must be ensured. Once bowel sounds are present, caloric needs can be met through nasogastric tube feedings using an appropriate high-calorie formula. Rarely, intravenous hyperalimentation is required.

# Neonates and Infants

In neonates and infants, more exacting management is required. Care is taken to avoid fluid overload from the solution used to keep the pressure-recording catheters patent. Because the infant's energy requirements are relatively large, 10% glucose is more appropriate than 5%. Small amounts of sodium are administered from the beginning because of the requirements of infants; a special protocol that includes 250 mL · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> · 24 h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> of a balanced salt solution is used (see Appendix 5K).

In infants, oral feeding is not begun until 8 hours after extubation. Small feedings of glucose water are then given every 4 hours; if well tolerated, an appropriate formula low in sodium is started after two or three feedings. Mothers who are breastfeeding may resume nursing their infant once he or she is strong enough. The infant must be picked up and held for the feedings and burped thereafter. If the infant is too weak to suck, gavage feedings of the mother's milk are given through a nasogastric tube.

Placement of a transpyloric feeding tube and initiation of feeding by continuous infusion is started in infants who have been intubated longer than about 2 days. If enteral feeding is necessary for more than a few days, the baby's caloric and other metabolic needs must be calculated and a determined effort made to meet them. If this does not become possible within 48 to 72 hours, or if abdominal distension or excessive diarrhea persists, intravenous hyperalimentation is begun.

During the first 48 postoperative hours, *hypoglycemia* may develop, particularly in neonates and infants less than 3 months old. Therefore, blood glucose is routinely measured twice daily in these patients, and as a precaution against hypoglycemia, 10% dextrose in water is used in maintenance fluids (see Appendix 5K). When hypoglycemia (blood glucose level < 80 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) occurs, 50 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> of glucose is given (1 mL · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> of 50% dextrose mixed with an equal amount of 5% glucose in water and administered intravenously over a 15-minute period). Blood glucose levels are measured 30 minutes later and at 4-hour intervals for 24 hours.

# Special Problems

As indicated earlier, some *metabolic acidosis* (base deficit of 2 mEq · L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> or greater) may be present during the early hours after cardiac surgery even when the patient is convalescing normally. It is left untreated if arterial pH is 7.4 or greater and PaCO2 is 30 mmHg or above. When PaCO2 is less than 30 mmHg, the base deficit is treated before adjusting PaCO2 appropriately upward. When pH is less than 7.4, the base deficit is treated (see Appendix 5L). However, if convalescence is otherwise normal, treatment is delayed for 4 to 8 hours in adults and for 2 to 4 hours in infants, by which time the base deficit may have cleared spontaneously. In infants particularly, it is best to avoid an additional sodium load whenever possible.

A mild *metabolic alkalosis* may be present 24 hours after operation in normally convalescing patients, probably related in part to the citrate load contained in the anticoagulant solution of banked blood. Metabolic alkalosis is self-correcting under these circumstances and is not treated. When large amounts of homologous blood containing sodium citrate have been transfused, important metabolic alkalosis can occur. Metabolism of the citrate leaves bicarbonate as the only anion available to balance sodium ions. This situation may be exacerbated after 2 to 4 days by migration of hydrogen ions from the cells, because hydrogen ions are replaced by potassium ions, and serum potassium falls, sometimes precipitously, in association with potassium loss in urine. Relatively large amounts of potassium chloride must be given under such circumstances (up to 200 mEq in 24 hours), but the dose should be titrated against 4-hourly serum potassium measurements. The alkalosis is associated with a fall in serum chloride and a compensatory rise in PaCO2. Provided renal function is adequate, the situation will correct itself. If it

continues to worsen, the carbonic anhydrase inhibiter acetazolamide is administered, usually intravenously at a dose of 5 mg  $\cdot$  kg<sup>-1</sup> up to 250 mg in adults once or twice a day as needed until the alkalosis is corrected.

#### **BODY TEMPERATURE**

The most frequently misunderstood phenomenon after cardiac surgery is abnormality in body temperature. Most normally convalescing patients are febrile for at least 4 to 5 days after operation, and in some the hyperthermia persists 2 weeks or longer<sup>B10,D12,L14</sup> (Fig. 5-13). During this period, those unfamiliar with cardiac surgical patients frequently order numerous blood, sputum, and urine cultures, white blood cell (WBC) counts, and other special studies without any indication other than fever. The expense of performing such studies is rarely justified, because the probability is low that the fever is anything other than a usual manifestation of the damaging effects of CPB. W27 A number of hypotheses have been advanced as to the etiology of the fever, including the possibility that elevated levels of interleukin are responsible.

When the patient continues to be febrile at time of hospital discharge, blood cultures are drawn, but discharge is allowed. Blood cultures in this setting are nearly always negative, but the patient and responsible physicians are warned that hyperthermia may continue or episodically disappear and appear. Fever may occasionally be accompanied by chills. C25 Further blood cultures are prudent during these subsequent episodes, but the probability is high that infection is not present and that the fever will gradually disappear spontaneously.

By contrast, severe and increasing hyperthermia during the first 6 to 36 hours after operation is a potentially lethal complication; it does not result from infection, but its precise etiology is not known. It may relate in part to the hypermetabolic state that characterizes the early period after cardiac surgery with CPB. C13,T12 Hyperthermia is often associated with low cardiac output and lowered blood flow through the skin, which impairs heat loss. Some simple measures may be initiated (see Appendix 5M), but in the face of a severe tendency toward hyperpyrexia, these measures may be ineffective in stopping the rise in body temperature. The condition is

**Figure 5-14** Relationship between resting whole body oxygen consumption  $(\dot{V}_{O_2})$  and body temperature. Nomogram depicts the Van't Hoff equation, in which the  $Q_{10}$  was considered to be 2.3. Confidence intervals are not placed around point estimates because of uncertainties as to actual  $Q_{10}$  in this setting (see "Oxygen Consumption during Hypothermia" in Section I of Chapter 2 for a more complete discussion of this relation). Note marked increase in  $\dot{V}_{O_2}$  with hyperthermia.

then an important emergency, and peritoneal dialysis is initiated, with the dialysate at room temperature or colder. Adequacy of cardiac output is maintained at as high a level as possible because of the powerful effect of hyperthermia in increasing whole body oxygen consumption (Fig. 5-14).

Severe hyperthermia in this setting appears to have little relation to the syndrome of so-called malignant hyperthermia<sup>N4</sup>; specific treatment for that syndrome has not been shown to be effective in patients with severe hyperpyrexia associated with CPB.

#### **CARDIAC TAMPONADE**

Recognition and treatment of acute tamponade in the first 24 hours after operation is discussed in Section I under Causes of Acute Dysfunction (Low Cardiac Output) after Cardiac Surgery. Weitzman and colleagues found by echocardiographic study that 103 of 122 consecutive patients (84%; CL 80%-88%) had pericardial effusions during recovery from cardiac surgery w17; a similar prevalence was found by Ikaheimo and colleagues. Large pericardial effusions 4 to 10 days postoperatively develop in 30% of patients and are more common in patients in whom early postoperative bleeding was excessive or in cardiac transplant patients. Effusions reach their maximum size in most patients on about the tenth postoperative day, generally regressing spontaneously thereafter. Most pericardial effusions are asymptomatic and require no treatment.

Cardiac tamponade develops in only about 1% of patients with pericardial fluid. 12,W17 It occasionally develops in the ICU, and prompt reoperation is required (see "Acute Cardiac Tamponade" under Causes of Acute Dysfunction [Low Cardiac Output] after Cardiac Surgery in Section I).

Delayed cardiac tamponade may develop several days to several weeks after the patient leaves the OR. Although delayed tamponade is uncommon, it is more common among patients being treated with anticoagulants. It also may have a higher prevalence when small incisions are used. If unrecognized, delayed tamponade can cause serious morbidity and

mortality.E5,H22,H24,M22 Clinical signs and symptoms may be subtle, but one or more of the following are usually present: progressive and unexplained weakness and lethargy; progressive dyspnea on exertion or orthopnea; unexplained hepatomegaly, ascites, or peripheral edema; elevated jugular venous pressure; pulsus paradoxus; widening of the cardiac silhouette on chest radiography; and unexplained prerenal azotemia.K17 A chest radiograph (which should be taken routinely the day before hospital discharge or the seventh postoperative day, whichever comes first) usually shows enlargement of the cardiac silhouette before symptoms appear. Cardiac tamponade may, however, not become apparent until as late as 4 months after operation.O4

Treatment consists of pericardial decompression by either pericardiocentesis or surgical drainage. If performed surgically, the subxyphoid portion of the incision is reopened, and the pericardial space is entered at the diaphragm. When a week or more has elapsed from surgery, great care is required to gently dissect along the diaphragmatic surface until the fluid collection is entered. Undue haste can result in inadvertent entry into the right ventricle, which can be friable and soft. Mortality has occurred under such circumstances. After drainage of the fluid with a surgical sucker, a flexible drain is generally left in the pericardial space for 24 hours to drain any residual fluid.

# INFECTION

# Prevalence

Fortunately, important wound complications are uncommon after cardiac surgery. These complications are usually in the form of mediastinitis and sternal dehiscence. In a prospective study by Breyer and colleagues, prevalence was 0.8%,B26 but it has been reported to be 1.5% by Culliford and colleagues and as high as 8% when bilateral internal thoracic artery–to– coronary artery bypass grafting is performed.C33 Reported mortality after this complication varies widely, from 6% to 70%.C11 With early effective treatment, it is 5% to 10%.D9

Although edema and some hematoma formation are common in a leg from which a saphenous vein has been removed, infection occurs infrequently (1%-2% of cases).W26

# Risk Factors

Imperfect aseptic technique in the OR is the cause of infected median sternotomy wounds. An undrained retrosternal hematoma is an incremental risk factor.C33 This is one reason for leaving the pericardium open as a routine after cardiac operations; retrosternal bleeding falls into the pericardial space and is aspirated by the pericardial drainage tubes. Prolonged operative time is also a risk factor for development of mediastinal infections.E6,W26 Inaccurate and insecure sternal closure increases the occurrence of important sternal infections.S4 Reoperation for bleeding is not a risk factor.

Obesity is clearly a risk factor for infection in the median sternotomy wound.W26 The combination of diabetes, obesity, and harvesting of both internal thoracic arteries has been associated with increased prevalence of wound infections.K32 Intraoperative hyperglycemia has been correlated with more postoperative infections in adultsF17 and childrenO2 after cardiac surgery. Among pediatric patients, hyperglycemia (>130 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) during the first 24 hours after operation has been identified as a risk factor for mediastinitis.G8

Chronic obstructive lung disease predisposes patients to sternal dehiscence and infection. Male gender is a risk factor, probably related to the common practice of shaving the patient the day before operation when hair is present.

Prolonged mechanical ventilation after operation also increases risk of infection in the median sternotomy,N5 as does need for postoperative dialysis.C6 Corticosteroids greatly increase the risk of sternal wound infection. These drugs must therefore be discontinued completely or reduced to the lowest possible dose for several weeks (ideally, 6 or more) before operation. Despite the clear association between steroids and depressed wound healing, cardiac transplantation (with nearly routine use of pre- and postoperative steroids) has been performed with a low occurrence of mediastinal infection in many centers (see Chapter 21).

### Prevention

A precise aseptic technique by the surgical, anesthetic, and perfusionist team is an essential part of prophylaxis against infection in open cardiac operations. The many people involved and the length and complexity of the operations make bacterial contamination more likely than in shorter and simpler procedures. It has been demonstrated that control of the surgical and ICU environment and awareness of the problem among personnel importantly reduce the prevalence of infection.F3 Preoperative shaving should be done immediately before the operation, if at all.F1

Infection inside or around the heart, particularly when prostheses have been used, is a major threat to the patient's life. Therefore, prophylactic antibiotic therapy is recommended for cardiac operations.F6,M35 Adequate blood levels of antibiotics should be present immediately before and during operation and while any intravascular or endotracheal device is in place.B29 Administration is therefore commenced at induction of anesthesia, an additional dose is given before CPB, and a dose is given immediately after CPB. An appropriate intermittent dosage schedule is continued through the second postoperative day or 24 hours after removal of the last intravascular or endotracheal device.B29 Drug and dosage vary according to prevalence of organisms and their susceptibility.

For many reasons, including to minimize the risk of infection, all intravascular and endotracheal devices should be removed as early postoperatively as possible. Infection is also minimized by simplifying postoperative care, early transfer out of the ICU, early ambulation and oral alimentation, and early hospital discharge.

#### Treatment

Occasionally a small, localized, subcutaneous collection of serum or necrotic fat may suggest a wound infection when in fact none is present. These minor complications occur in about 2% of patients.B26 Such collections should be left alone until it becomes clear that a wound infection is present. Even when a small amount of frank pus drains from the wound, mediastinitis should not be assumed to be present unless the sternum has become unstable, a retrosternal collection of fluid is demonstrated by CT, or drainage can be shown to be coming through the sternum from the retrosternal area. Even sternal dehiscence is not unequivocally diagnostic of infection; occasionally the dehiscence is sterile.

Unusual fever and malaise, sternal tenderness, and persistent severe central chest pain not relieved by usual analgesics suggest the possibility of an important sternotomy infection despite absence of obvious inflammatory changes in the skin. Under these circumstances, the wound is examined twice daily for evidence of sternal instability or drainage coming through the sternum, and repeated blood and wound cultures are taken. Antibiotics are generally not begun until infection is confirmed, but should be initiated with suspected infection in the presence of prosthetic material in or around the heart. As soon as possible, the antibiotic regimen should be tailored to the cultures and microbial sensitivities in order to be specific for the organisms involved.

Diagnosis of an infected wound should be made before there is extensive breakdown of the wound skin edges. CT scans may be helpful and should be obtained when diagnosis is uncertain, but it must be remembered that at least edema and some hemorrhage in the anterior mediastinum are usually present in normally convalescing patients and are visible on CT. However, the diagnosis through CT scanning of retrosternal fluid with air pockets or sternal disruption is usually indicative of mediastinitis.K10

As soon as the diagnosis of an infected median sternotomy incision is made, the patient is returned to the OR and anesthetized, and a formal operation is undertaken.S19 The entire median sternotomy incision is reopened, and all the sternal wires, other suture material, and necrotic tissue are removed. Usually the infection is most marked immediately in front of and behind the sternum, and minimal around the heart itself. In this situation, although a few small fragments of sternum may be removed, extensive débridement of the sternum is not performed. The wound is thoroughly irrigated first with warm saline solution and then with dilute povidoneiodine solution. Two small (16F) chest tubes are left anteriorly for the postoperative continuous infusion of dilute povidone-iodine or antibiotic solution, and two larger tubes (20F or 24Fr) are left posteriorly for aspiration of fluid. Generally, the sternum is closed by rewiring, and the tissues anterior to it, including the skin, are closed en bloc by vertical mattress sutures.

The wound is irrigated continuously with 1 to 2 mL · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> of dilute (0.5%) povidone-iodine or antibiotic solution through the anterior tubes, and suction is continuously applied to the dependent tubes.T6 Full-strength povidoneiodine must be avoided because it injures tissue.K35 When an antibiotic solution is used for irrigation, the level of the agent in the solution should be the same as the level in blood during maximal parenteral treatment. An input/output chart must be maintained. If the balance becomes positive, infusion is stopped until the fluid is recovered. Irrigations are not effective after 3 to 4 days, because by then the tubes have become sequestered from the retrosternal space. They are therefore removed at that time.

If the infection is extensive, more rapid recovery occurs when the wound is closed with musculocutaneous flapsJ4,J10,P5,S37 or, when needed, omental transfer,H15,S12 after débridement. In most cases, the most rapid recovery is accomplished with initial débridement and irrigation, followed by early planned pectoralis flaps and partial or complete sternectomy within several days. Generally, it is prudent to perform this with the plastic surgeon. Rarely, the infection is so extensive the wound is left open 3 to 5 days, with a bulky dressing and drainage tubes, and then the closure accomplished.J6 These techniques are useful in infants and children as well as adults. With these protocols, most patients survive this potentially lethal complication and experience good long-term functional results.B27,K29

# CHYLOTHORAX

Effused chyle may be present in the thoracic cavity after repair of coarctation of the aorta, after placement of Blalock-Taussig or (less frequently) PTFE interposition shunts, or (rarely) after repair of patent ductus arteriosus.C7,H18 In such instances, chylothorax probably results from cutting large tributaries of the thoracic duct or, less frequently, from injury to the thoracic duct itself. More complex and difficult to manage are the chylothoraces (and on occasion, pericardial accumulations of chyle with tamponade) that follow operations through a median sternotomy, such as atrial switch procedures for transposition of the great arteries, superior vena cava–right pulmonary artery anastomoses, and the Fontan procedure. Chylothorax probably results from the combination of inevitable transection of small lymph channels (probably in the thymus gland) and elevation of superior vena caval pressure that follows these procedures.

In these patients, the lipid content in chylothorax consists of triglycerides that enter the pleural space as chyle, originating from large lymphatics that have been divided or from generalized lymphatic leakage, presumably from elevated right atrial pressure. Chyle contains a high content of triglycerides in the form of chylomicrons, which produces a milky appearance of the lymphatic fluid. The potential for relative immunodeficiency developing during prolonged chylothoraces relates to the high content of lymphocytes (primarily T lymphocytes) in chyle. In addition, chyle is rich in immunoglobulins and fat-soluble vitamins absorbed from the intestines. Chyle flow increases with dietary intake of fat, particularly long-chain triglycerides, which are absorbed into the lymphatic system from the intestines.

Chylothorax may develop immediately after operation, in which case it may not be recognized initially because the fluid may appear to be serous. In most such cases, chylous drainage subsides spontaneously, and continuation of effective tube drainage is all that is necessary. However, chylothorax may not develop for a week or more. In that case, needle aspirations repeated every 3 to 4 days usually constitute adequate treatment. Late-appearing chylothoraces after closed operations are particularly likely to subside without operation, and the aspirations can be continued on an outpatient basis.

In early-appearing and persistently large chylothorax, such as may occur after open cardiac operations, the outlook with conservative treatment is less favorable. Malnutrition resistant to therapy rapidly develops. When the chylothorax is a complication of the Fontan operation, its management is part of the overall management of the patient (see Chapter 41). The general strategy includes strong suction (40 cm H2O) on the pleural chest tubes while maintaining nutrition with a low-fat diet and supplemental medium chain triglycerides. Octreotide may be a useful adjunct. If the drainage is persistent over about 7 days, surgical pleurodesis, thoracic duct ligation, and/or doxycycline installation into the chest tube is advisable. The tube is then returned to suction. Doxycycline is very irritating to the pleura, so pain control is important.

When chylothorax has developed as a complication of an operation performed through a lateral thoracotomy, surgical intervention is indicated if such drainage persists for more than about 7 days. The hemithorax in which the chyle is accumulating is entered through a posterolateral thoracotomy incision. Chylous leakage is sometimes easily seen and is oversewn. Unfortunately, the source is often not found, and watertight oversewing is not always possible. Under such circumstances, the thoracic duct can be sought behind the esophagus; if identified, it is doubly ligated, and this usually solves the problem. Even if these procedures are apparently successful, and certainly if they cannot be accomplished, the pleural space is scarified, and three properly placed intrapleural tubes are left for at least 96 hours to ensure the lung remains expanded and becomes adherent to the chest wall. Fibrin glue placed on the parietal pleura may enhance adherence.S33 A good result is usually obtained from a combination of these maneuvers.

Rarely, after cardiac operations other than the Fontan operation, chyle accumulates in the pericardial space, with or without chylothorax. This problem was first reported after operations with CPB by Thomas and McGoonT5 and has subsequently been reported by others. It has been reported after the Waterston anastomosis,H10,J1 in which, of course, the pericardium is opened. It has also been reported after a Blalock-Taussig shunt in which the pericardium was not opened.F4 This is a difficult problem, and initial management consists of wide and prompt operative drainage of the pericardium into the pleural spaces by making large pericardial windows and then draining both pleural spaces with chest tubes. Following this, the measures just described are used.

Careful attention to nutrition is important during the period of chylous drainage. Fortunately, chylothoraces have never been reported to become infected.

Although the benefit is unproven, it is generally prudent to restrict oral intake of fats and initiate a low-fat diet with oral supplementation of medium chain triglycerides, which are not taken up by lymphatics.C8,C12 Octreotide is the synthetic polypeptide that mimics natural somatostatin by inhibiting the release of multiple intestinal enzymes. The end result is a decrease in lymph flow by reducing splanchnic, hepatic, and portal blood flow, decreasing gastrointestinal motility, and inhibition of intestinal secretion of water and electrolytes.G20 Octreotide is initiated at 1 to 2 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , with a maximum dose of 10 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> once a persistent chylothorax is identified. Efficacy has been reported in the pediatric cardiac surgical population with this intervention.C8

In situations in which an infant or child with persistent chylothorax is either too unstable to tolerate a thoracotomy with open pleurodesis or persistent drainage occurs following pleurodesis, chemical pleurodesis is carried out with doxycycline installation through the chest tubes. A standard dose of 20 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (up to a maximum dose of 1 g) diluted in saline at a concentration of 1 to 8 mg · mL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> is injected through a chest tube. A standard dose is 20 mL · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , and the chest tubes are clamped for 4 to 6 hours following installation of doxycycline. The patient is turned from side to side to promote even distribution of this irritating agent, and the chest tubes are then reopened and placed to high suction. Installation of doxycycline is irritating to the pleura and is accompanied by considerable pain, so adequate analgesia is of major importance during installation. The dose can be repeated every 1 to 2 days. Reported success exceeds 90% by 4 days.H25

For refractory cases, some success has been reported with lymphangiography followed by percutaneous coiling of large lymphatics.B19

# POSTPERFUSION AND POSTCARDIOTOMY SYNDROMES

Postperfusion syndromes are complex and not yet fully understood. Whether they are totally attributable to the body's response to the damaging effects of CPB (see Chapter 2, Section II) or have multiple etiologies is uncertain.

A cytomegalic postperfusion syndrome has been described that consists of an infection with cytomegalovirus transmitted in homologous blood.W18 The larger the volume of blood used, the greater the chance of infection.C5 It produces moderate pyrexia beginning around the end of the first week, associated with a "flulike illness"; the patient complains of weakness, malaise, muscle pains, and sweating. Differential white blood cell count shows lymphocytosis and atypical mononuclear cells. The disease can be confirmed by demonstrating a rise in complement-fixing special antibody, and the virus can be isolated from the urine, although this is technically difficult. The Paul-Bunnell test is negative, excluding infectious mononucleosis (which can present an identical clinical picture) as a possible diagnosis. Although fever and symptoms usually persist for about 2 weeks, the disease is self-limiting, and no treatment is required. Depression is a common sequela.

Postcommissurotomy syndrome was described by Soloff and colleagues in 1953 when it was noted to follow closed mitral valve surgery.S28 Although they interpreted the syndrome as reactivation of rheumatic fever, it subsequently became clear it was not related to rheumatic fever and could occur after any operation that involved opening the pericardium—hence the name *postpericardiotomy syndrome*, I5 also called *postcardiotomy syndrome.* When Ito and colleagues coined the term *postpericardiotomy syndrome*, they suggested the syndrome was due to an immunologic reaction to damaged autologous tissue in the pericardial cavity.I5 Subsequent work at the same institutionE7-E9 confirmed an autoimmune theory of etiology. Apparently, heart-reactive antibodies appear in significant titers in most patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but the titer is much higher in patients who develop this syndrome.E8,E9

Whether there are single or multiple etiologies, it is a fact that in many patients, symptoms appear a few weeks to a few months after cardiac operations. Nishimura and colleagues found the median postoperative time of onset to be 4 weeks.N13 The most striking symptom is chest pain, both a central ache from pericarditis and severe pain from pleuritis. There may be no associated fever, but pericardial and pleural friction rubs are usually present, and often pericardial and pleural effusions. These are usually minor but may be major, and delayed pericardial tamponade can occur. There are no specific changes in the formed blood elements. Although the disease is self-limiting, its duration is highly variable, with a median of 22 days and a range of 2 to 100 days in the study by Nishimura and colleagues.N13 Recurrences are common, appearing in 21% of patients in the Mayo Clinic series.N13 In some of these patients, recurrence was as long as 30 months after a previous episode. The syndrome usually recurs should reoperation be required.

Pain and effusions are often relieved by bed rest and aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Although these symptoms are quickly resolved by prednisone, steroids should be avoided whenever possible because of their side effects. However, when symptoms persist, and once the diagnosis is secure and infection has been excluded, prednisone may be given initially in high doses (40 mg · day<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), gradually reduced, and completely discontinued within 4 to 8 weeks. Subsequent courses may be necessary.

An Italian multi-institutional randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of colchicine for preventing postpericardiotomy syndrome (COPPS trial) enrolled 360 patients with a primary endpoint of reducing occurrence of the syndrome within 12 months of surgery.I3 In the treatment arm, 1 mg of colchicine was given twice on the day of operation and followed by 1.5 mg twice daily for 30 days. The syndrome occurred less frequently (8.9% vs. 21%, *P =* .002) among treated patients. Most events occurred within 30 days.

General management of older children and adults after cardiac surgery, in the absence of specific complications, is relatively simple. This section describes general aspects of care, leaving many of the details and documentation to preceding discussions of subsystems.

Patients leave the OR with an arterial catheter in place and, optimally, pressure-monitoring catheters to reflect central venous pressure and, if desirable, left atrial or capillary wedge pressure. When elevated pulmonary artery pressures are anticipated, direct measurement of pulmonary artery pressure is also advisable. One or more routes of access to large central veins are in place. Risks associated with these devices are extremely low, but care is necessary in placing them, caring for them, and removing them. Proper placement of devices (see "Completing Operation" and "Left Atrial Pressure Monitoring" in Section III of Chapter 2) is key to preventing bleeding intraoperatively or at the time of their removal. Infection is a potential risk, but only 1.5% of such catheters have positive cultures when removed postoperatively.D2 Use of antibiotic or antiseptic gels around the site of emergence of these catheters is nonetheless a prudent precaution. Sterile technique in their management is essential.D2

Patients often come to the ICU intubated, still anesthetized, and with a nasogastric tube in place. They are attached to a ventilator (usually a volume-controlled one), as described in "Management and Treatment" under Pulmonary Subsystem in Section I. Fluids to be administered until 7 AM of postoperative day 1 (the day after operation) are calculated ("calculated fluids"), and these are begun as described in "Fluid, Electrolyte, and Caloric Intake" in Section II. The urinary catheter placed in the OR (usually a typical Foley catheter, although at times a suprapubic catheter) is connected to a drainage system that permits hourly urine flow to be measured conveniently. Chest tubes are attached to a container in which there is a negative pressure of about 30 to 40 cm H2O. Arrangements are made for measuring chest drainage at 30- to 60-minute intervals.

Many adult patients who are convalescing normally have systemic hypertension, at least in the early period after operation. Even when cardiac performance is good, prudence dictates controlling this hypertensive tendency. This is usually managed with sedation or a continuous infusion of nitroglycerin or nitroprusside (see Appendix 5A). If the hypertensive state continues, an oral hypertensive agent is usually started at the time of transfer out of the ICU. The dosage should be decreased, at least temporarily, at the time of hospital discharge; symptomatic arterial hypotension may otherwise develop. Finally, patients with impaired ventricular function and reasonable renal function may benefit from addition of afterload-reducing agents such as ACE inhibitors, Ca2<sup>+</sup> channel blocking agents, or both. Ultimately, this can positively affect ventricular remodeling and benefit cardiac performance.

Chest tube drainage may be reinfused into the patient by an automated system. The system may be "instructed" as to the level of left (or right) atrial pressure above which automatic reinfusion of shed blood is not to be performed. When this limit is not violated, the system automatically reinfuses chest tube drainage at a prescribed rate. At the direction of the surgeon or intensivist, automatic chest tube drainage reinfusion is stopped 6 to 12 hours after the patient comes to the ICU. At times, infusion of shed blood appears to perpetuate a bleeding tendency; in this circumstance, reinfusion is promptly discontinued.

When chest tube drainage is sufficiently small that reoperation will clearly not be indicated, and when all subsystems give evidence of functioning well, consideration is given to extubating the patient. When patients are convalescing normally with appropriate cardiac and pulmonary reserves, the vast majority can be extubated either on the day of operation or the following morning. In concert with the anesthesiologist, many CPB operations in adults and children can be conducted using short-acting drugs that allow extubation within 1 to 4 hours following transfer to the ICU. It is thought this shortens ICU stay and decreases overall costs.

The nasogastric tube is removed just before extubation, and as before extubation, the head of the bed is elevated to about 30 degrees. Deep breathing exercises and spontaneous coughing are encouraged, and chest vibropercussion is carried out on a regular basis. Sips of water are allowed as well as other clear liquids, but no effort is made to attain a prescribed fluid intake by mouth, the intravenous route being relied upon for another 24 hours. In children, the urinary catheter may be removed, but in many of them and in adults it can remain in place another day.

Chest tubes are usually removed early on the morning of the first postoperative day, because appreciable chest drainage has usually ceased by then. When chest tubes are in the pleural space, the lower posterior tubes are removed first, and those in the upper and anterior parts of the thorax a few minutes to a few hours thereafter. This sequence allows for evacuation of air that may have been introduced with removal of the posterior tubes. Often it is most appropriate to remove the chest tubes before extubating the patient, but this is not necessary. Intracardiac monitoring devices generally may be removed on the morning after operation in older children and adults. It is advantageous but not necessary that they be removed before removing chest tubes. In neonates and young infants, monitoring devices should be removed before the chest tubes, and this is usually not on the first day postoperatively. Some surgeons recommend leaving a soft, malleable drainage catheter in the mediastinum of children and adults for several days (attached to a negative pressure bulb) to drain any residual pericardial fluid while the patient is ambulatory.

After extubating the patient and removing intracardiac catheters and chest tubes, a final portable chest radiograph is obtained. If this is satisfactory, the arterial catheter is removed and the patient transferred to either the pediatric or adult cardiac surgical unit for continuation of convalescence. Because mild vasomotor instability is common after cardiac operations, adult patients frequently experience lightheadedness on initial standing the day after surgery. Some surgeons recommend routine assessment of orthostatic blood pressure changes (lying, sitting, standing) prior to transfer out of the ICU so that any orthostasis can be corrected before the patient begins ambulating in the hospital room. If the urinary catheter is still in place on the morning of postoperative day 2, it is removed; when a suprapubic catheter is used, the patient's ability to void can be tested before removing the catheter. When normal convalescence to this point is confirmed, all intravenous catheters are removed. Patients are urged to ambulate and begin self-care to the extent possible.

When progress continues to be satisfactory, the patient is generally discharged from the hospital on the fourth or fifth postoperative day. Some institutions discharge on the third postoperative day, finding this management protocol highly satisfactory for some adult patients.K36 Early hospital discharge implies daily follow-up in an outpatient facility or by a responsible physician for at least 2 to 3 more days.K36 A final chest radiograph and ECG are obtained in the outpatient facility. Appropriateness of all medications and postoperative advice is ascertained at that time, and the patient is carefully instructed as to these matters. All information is conveyed to the patient's general physician, cardiologist, or pediatric cardiologist, who then assumes responsibility for the patient.

At discharge, children may still be somewhat withdrawn and ill at ease, even with parents. Every effort is made to help parents understand the normality of this situation, and they are advised of ways the child's return to an entirely normal relation with them can be expedited.

A program of daily exercise should be started as soon as the patient leaves the hospital and should emphasize regular walking for progressively longer periods. Patients who were active and gainfully employed before operation are urged to return to full activity (and employment in the case of adults) as soon as possible and, except under unusual circumstances, no later than 2 to 3 months after the procedure.

# **Section IV General Care of Neonates and Infants**

Neonates, infants, and some small young children present postoperative care problems that differ in some ways from those of adults. Principles of subsystem and overall care remain the same, but the internal milieu of even normal neonates and infants is different in certain respects from adults. The cardiac operation has generally been more urgently indicated, and therefore these young patients often have more preoperative derangements and require more extensive operations. Cardiac reserve of neonates and infants is often less than that of adults after cardiac surgery because of the nature and seriousness of their preoperative cardiac condition. Their small airways are more apt to be suddenly obstructed by secretions, and they are subject to special problems such as episodes of pulmonary arterial hypertensive crises. Serum potassium level rises much more rapidly during oliguria in small patients than it does in older children and adults. These considerations do not necessarily indicate that young age per se is a risk factor for death after cardiac surgery; they do indicate that special attention must be given to them. As in Section III, we provide the general aspects of postoperative care of neonates and infants here, with details presented in the discussions of the various subsystems.

If the endotracheal tube has not been inserted through the nose initially, a nasotracheal tube may be substituted for the orotracheal tube before the patient leaves the OR. A urinary catheter, intracardiac recording devices, epicardial myocardial wires, and intravenous access to large central veins are in place when the patient leaves the OR, just as in adults. Intravenous access in the caval or internal jugular veins is generally avoided in patients having cavopulmonary connections, because of the risk of thrombosis. In the ICU, the patient is placed on a ventilator specifically designed for small patients. Often, 2.5 to 5 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> of dopamine is infused, even in patients convalescing normally, and this is generally continued until the morning of postoperative day 1.

Because measuring devices and infusion of medications require some fluid, and because it is desirable to limit the total fluid intake in neonates and infants just as it is in adults, all continuously infused medications are mixed in sufficient concentration that the infusion rate does not exceed 2 to 3 mL · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , the minimal rate at which reasonably accurate infusions can be given. No "calculated fluids" are planned for the day of operation, and this can be reconsidered early on the morning of postoperative day 1. Calculations are made as to the amount of fluid administered not only by the intravenous route but also in flushing pressure-measuring devices, and at 7 AM of postoperative day 1, consideration is given to beginning administration of "calculated fluids" or continuing without them (see Appendix 5K).

Once the patient is settled on the ventilator, the status of anesthetic and sedating medication is assessed. The goal in general is to keep the patient paralyzed and sedated at least until the morning of postoperative day 1. For paralysis, appropriate doses of pancuronium (or a comparable agent) are administered intravenously. This is insufficient to overcome many possibly deleterious reflexes. Therefore, fentanyl is also given as a continuous infusion of about 10 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , and at times at the increased dose of 15 to 25 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , not only for sedation but also for control of sympathetic activity.H17,H28 Particularly when the nasotracheal tube is suctioned, the patient must be under the influence of fentanyl.H16 Ventilation is arranged to keep arterial PaCO2 at about 30 mmHg, arterial PaO2 above 120 mmHg, and if possible, pH at 7.45 or higher. This minimizes the tendency for pulmonary vascular resistance to rise paroxysmally (see "Pulmonary Hypertensive Crises" under Pulmonary Subsystem in Section I).

We recommend irrigating the endotracheal tube with saline and suctioning every 2 hours, although some who do not use fentanyl favor no suctioning of the endotracheal tube. Whatever the policy, it must be recognized that this is a potentially hazardous procedure, and it should be undertaken only by skilled nurses with adequate backup should an emergency develop during or within a few minutes after suctioning.

Early on the morning of postoperative day 1, consideration is given to extubating the patient. If all subsystems appear to be functioning satisfactorily, the protocol leading to extubation is begun. A dose of dexamethasone (0.3 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) is administered about 1 hour before extubation, for its presumed effect in minimizing laryngeal edema, and then 0.1 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> is given 2 hours later and another dose 2 hours thereafter. Then, if the patient is awake and active, extubation is accomplished. After extubation, the baby is maintained in a humidified oxygen-enriched environment for at least another 24 hours in the ICU, although care is taken to avoid excessively high PaO2.

If all subsystems are not functioning well on the morning after operation, there should be no hesitancy to continue control of ventilation as well as paralysis and sedation for another 24 hours. However, about 70% of normally convalescing neonates and small infants can be extubated the morning after operation and the remainder usually on the morning of postoperative day 2.

Following extubation and the passage of a few hours, oral feedings can be started. For the feedings, the patient is held at least in a semi-upright position, observing the usual precautions necessary in feeding small babies (see Appendix 5N). Neonates and young infants have little nutritional reserve. When oral intake is not possible on postoperative day 1 or 2, nasogastric tube feeding is begun. If this is not promptly effective, intravenous hyperalimentation is begun (see "Fluid, Electrolyte, and Caloric Intake" in Section II).

To avoid bleeding after their removal, intracardiac catheters should *not* be removed before postoperative day 2. It is prudent but not mandatory to leave all chest tubes in place until after intracardiac devices have been removed.

When convalescence is not normal for any reason, management is altered appropriately, generally as described in the earlier parts of this chapter.

A special situation is presented early postoperatively by neonates and young infants when the operation leaves pulmonary blood flow coming solely from a surgically created systemic–pulmonary artery shunt (see Special Features of Postoperative Care in Chapter 49). In these intubated patients, magnitude of pulmonary blood flow is largely determined by the relation of systemic to pulmonary vascular resistance.R22 When pulmonary resistance is low, pulmonary blood flow tends to be excessive and systemic blood flow small. Should pulmonary vascular resistance gradually or suddenly rise, pulmonary blood flow declines, sometimes rapidly, and hypoxia develops. In this setting, pulmonary vascular resistance is largely determined by arterial PaCO2 and arterial pH. Manipulation of PaCO2 is the best method for regulating pulmonary vascular resistance. When pulmonary blood flow appears to be too high and systemic blood flow too low, arterial PaCO2 is deliberately elevated modestly (to 40 to 45 mmHg) to increase pulmonary vascular resistance, decrease pulmonary blood flow, and increase systemic blood flow. When pulmonary blood flow seems too low and hypoxia too prominent, pulmonary arteriolar resistance is lowered by lowering the arterial PaCO2 appropriately, usually to 25 to 35 mmHg.

Alterations in arterial PaCO2 are conveniently accomplished by altering tidal volume and respiratory rate. The adjustments required are usually sufficiently small that they produce no change in other important variables. Alternatively, ventilatory variables are set so that arterial PaCO2 is 25 to 30 mmHg; if subsequent pulmonary blood flow seems excessive or systemic blood flow too low, or both, PaCO2 is increased by simply increasing the fractional concentration of carbon dioxide in the inspired air.

# **Section V Automated Care in the Intensive Care Unit**

Because most treatment decisions in the ICU are based on use of numeric data and an orderly set of rules and logic,K19 automation can be used for making, displaying, and storing observations and for intervening in some situations via a closed-loop computer system. These concepts were described in 1968,S16 but bedside hardware and computers have been continuously modified since. Computers can be cost-effective, prevent rules-based errors (see "Human Error" in Chapter 6), serve as "cognitive prostheses" to simplify presentation of complex multidimensional data, and provide strategic decision support to the surgical faculty, house staff, and nurses. Although there are studies and opinions to the contrary,E2 these reflect a difference in orientation and goals and thus a different method of using automated care. The ICU computer may do the following:

- 1. Using the patient's age, height, weight, and hemoglobin level, the computer calculates and prints out surgeon-specific preoperative orders, directions for assembly and priming the pump-oxygenator, and postoperative orders.
- 2. At designated intervals (e.g., every 2 minutes), the computer can automatically measure, numerically display, and record systemic and pulmonary artery systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures; right and left atrial pressures; heart rate; chest tube drainage; urine flow; and temperature. Plots of these data can be displayed on command.
- 3. The computer, continually sensing drainage from the chest, automatically reinfuses all the shed blood and uses the desired atrial pressure limit to interrupt infusions when the limit is exceeded.
- 4. Using computer logic and the rules described under "Bleeding" in Section II, messages can be displayed suggesting reoperation.
- 5. Arterial blood gas and hemoglobin levels are stored and displayed. The base excess or deficit is calculated. When metabolic acidosis is present, the recommended dose of bicarbonate is calculated using the rules and logic in Appendix 5L.

# Section VI Body Surface Area

Because cardiac output has traditionally been normalized according to body surface area ([BSA] as cardiac index), other variables related to cardiac surgical patients are optimally normalized in the same way. The computation of BSA by the classic Boyd formula (a more general statement of the original DuBois formula) requires knowledge of height and weight, and height is not always available in clinical studies. A nomogram (Fig. 5-15, *A*) can be used to estimate BSA from weight, but in some situations, not even weight is available. In these circumstances, a nomogram (Fig. 5-15, *B*) can be used to estimate BSA based on age alone.

# **5A Protocol for Reducing Arterial Blood Pressure and Afterload**

*Sodium nitroprusside* is administered intravenously (IV) continuously or intermittently as required. It acts directly on arterial (and to a lesser extent, venous) smooth muscle and thus decreases systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance and systemic venous tone. Its onset and end of action are immediate. The dose is 1 to 10 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (doses larger than this are *not* used), regulated in most cases to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure 10% above the normal value for the patient's age. In patients with thick left ventricular walls or coronary artery disease, concern about coronary perfusion pressure makes a mean arterial blood pressure 20% above normal desirable (or 150 mmHg in adults). Fifty or 100 µg of sodium nitroprusside are dissolved in 150 mL of 5% glucose in water. The drug may be administered with a servo-pump using a closed-loop systemS16 under computer controlS17,S18 or with a slow-infusion pump. When nitroprusside is being administered, methods should be available for measuring blood thiocyanate levels, because values of >10 g · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> are potentially toxic.C19,P6 Toxicity is manifested by signs of intracellular suppression of oxygen consumption (elevation of mixed venous oxygen levels, narrowing of arterial/venous oxygen difference, and metabolic acidosis) and by anorexia, muscular spasms, disorientation, and convulsions. Toxicity is due largely to the formation of cyanide, the major metabolic product of sodium nitroprusside.C27,P6 Toxicity is treated by IV infusion over 15 minutes of 150 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> of a 25% solution of sodium thiosulfate (10 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ).

*Nitroglycerin* decreases venous tone but also decreases coronary resistance.C14 It is therefore particularly useful when myocardial ischemia is present.E11 Infusion rates of 0.5 to 3 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> are recommended.K17 Nitroglycerin is absorbed into polyvinyl tubing used for IV infusion, and the concentration reaching the patient is less than planned until the tubing becomes saturated. Nitroglycerin is not as effective as nitroprusside in lowering arterial pressure.

A single-dose longer-acting drug, *diazoxide*, is available although seldom used. The dose is 3 to 5 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . *Phentolamine* (Regitine) is another vasodilator used on occasion. It has an α-adrenergic receptor blocking effect, produces direct smooth muscle relaxation, and reduces pulmonary vascular resistance.N10 Its recommended infusion rates are 1.5 to 2 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . K17

*Phenoxybenzamine* is a noncompetitive blocker of α-receptors with a prolonged (12- to 24-hour) effect and a delayed (30- to 60-minute) onset. It acts on both arterial and venous vessels and has no important side effects. It is administered IV in a dose of 1 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , with the solution diluted in 20 to 50 mL of normal saline solution and infused slowly over about 15 minutes. The disadvantage of phenoxybenzamine is that its α-blocking effect is complete for at least 12 hours; thus, the drug is not used until the need for prolonged afterload reduction has been established by the patient's response to a sodium nitroprusside infusion over about 12 hours. Rather than continue infusing sodium nitroprusside at a high rate, phenoxybenzamine may be substituted and the dose repeated in 12 to 15 hours when it is clear its effect is wearing off. The *phosphodiesterase inhibitors* milrinone and amrinone may also produce a salutary vasodilatory effect.

# **5C Protocol for Managing Some Aspects of Ventricular Electrical Instability**

# Early Interventions for Ventricular Electrical Instability

- 1. Give lidocaine as an intravenous (IV) bolus injection (the dose is 1 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> for adults and children, although in adults the usual dose is 50 mg) if the arrhythmia is premature ventricular contraction (PVC) or ventricular tachycardia (VT) with a good hemodynamic state. If there is VT and reduction of cardiac output, use *immediate DC cardioversion* (100 and then 200 J).
- 2. Draw a blood sample for determination of serum K<sup>+</sup> ; when the result is available, treat hypokalemia (K<sup>+</sup> concentration < 4.0 mEq · L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) if present:
  - a. Administer 5 mEq K<sup>+</sup> as an IV bolus.
  - b. Administer 20 mEq K<sup>+</sup> in 50 mL of 5% glucose over 1 hour; then obtain repeat serum K<sup>+</sup> level measurement and repeat treatment until serum level is satisfactory (at least 3.5 mEq · L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and preferably 4.0 mEq · L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ).
  - c. Double the IV maintenance K<sup>+</sup> dose.

- d. Recheck serum K<sup>+</sup> level. If it is <4.0 mEq · L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , order oral K<sup>+</sup> supplement as 20% KCl, 10 mL twice a day in orange juice (60 mEq approximate daily dose).
- 3. If the ventricular rate is <80 to 90 beats/min, initiate pacing. If basic rhythm is sinus or atrioventricular (AV) junctional, use atrial pacing. When cardiac rhythm is other than sinus or AV junctional, or atrial pacing fails to result in 1:1 AV conduction, use ventricular pacing (with the ventricular wire electrode attached to negative pole of pacer). In the presence of second- or third-degree AV block, consider AV sequential pacing.

# Interventions after Control of the Urgent Situation

If the arrhythmia recurs promptly or is not controlled by these simple measures, begin continuous IV lidocaine infusion in a dose of 20 to 50 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , or 0.02 to 0.05 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> .

# **5D Protocols for Acute Management of Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation**

■ In hemodynamically stable adult patients, intravenous verapamil, diltiazem, esmolol, propranolol, or amiodarone are effective alternative therapies:

*Ibutilide:* after pretreatment with intravenous magnesium (1g), 1 mg infused over 10 minutes; repeat once if no conversion

*Verapamil:* 5-10 mg IV as bolus; may repeat after 10-15 minutes

Adverse effect: infrequently hypotension, later increase of heart rate

*Diltiazem:* 20 mg IV over 2 minutes, may repeat **×** 1 Adverse effect: infrequently hypotension *Esmolol:* 0.5 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> IV infusion Adverse effect: hypotension, bronchospasm

*Propranolol:* 0.05 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> or 5-mg bolus IV

Adverse effect: hypotension

*Amiodarone:* 150 mg IV over 10 minutes Adverse effect: rarely hypotension

■ Unstable hemodynamics

Digoxin has classically been recommended, but it may be slow to act (3-8 hours) and relatively ineffective at decreasing heart rate in postoperative patients with increased sympathetic activity. In the elderly or in the presence of compromised renal function, the therapeutic window is narrow and toxicity may occur.

An estimated digitalizing dose of digoxin provides a convenient guideline for the cardiac surgeon. The estimated dose of digoxin, when no digitalis has been given in the past 10 days, may be considered to be 0.9 mg · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> intravenously and 1.6 mg · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> orally. The digitalizing dose in infants may be considered 50 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> intravenously, and the maintenance dose 10 to 15 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · day<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> .

DC cardioversion *Amiodarone*

- Recurrent atrial fibrillation *Procainamide:* 500-1000 mg orally, every 6-8 hours *Sotalol:* initially 80 mg twice daily
- Anticoagulation

The prevalence of stroke attributable to postoperative atrial fibrillation is unknown. It seems justifiable to initiate anticoagulation if atrial fibrillation persists longer than 48 hours or is recurrent. In these instances, warfarin is recommended. If elective cardioversion is planned, IV heparin is recommended and is prescribed in therapeutic doses.

# **5E Protocol for Rapid Atrial Pacing via Atrial Wires**

#### Rapid Atrial Pacing

The technique of rapid atrial pacing is applied to *atrial flutter*, defined as a general atrial rate of 250 to 350 beats · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> with a constant beat-to-beat cycle length that *can be interrupted* by rapid atrial pacing. This is rarely possible in *atrial flutter-fibrillation*, a more rapid type of atrial flutter with a rate > 350 beats · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , and is not possible in atrial fibrillation.

ECG limb leads are placed on the patient for monitoring, and the two atrial wires are connected to the rapid atrial pacer. Because the atrial pacing threshold is usually high during atrial flutter, output is set at 10 to 20 mA. Bipolar atrial pacing is used because the stimulus artifact then rarely distorts the ECG tracing, and the atrial complex in the ECG is clearly seen so that atrial capture can be verified.

A relatively slow pacing rate is used first, because occasionally, immediate one-to-one conduction occurs with rapid ventricular tachycardia, which is to be avoided. After this, there are several possible maneuvers for control of atrial flutter and its rapid ventricular response, as described by Waldo and MacLean.W1

## *Ramp Technique*

Atrial pacing is begun at a rate 10 beats · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> faster than the atrial flutter rate. The rate of atrial pacing is then gradually increased. When the typical negative atrial complex in lead II changes to a positive atrial complex, indicating capture by pacing, atrial pacing is either abruptly stopped or gradually slowed until the ventricular rate is considered satisfactory.

# *Constant Rate Technique*

Pacing is initiated at a rate 10 beats · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> faster than the spontaneous atrial flutter rate. After pacing at this rate for about 30 seconds, pacing is either abruptly stopped or the pacing rate quickly slowed until the ventricular rate is considered satisfactory. If these maneuvers are unsuccessful in interrupting the atrial flutter, they are repeated, with the initial atrial pacing rate increased in increments of 10 beats · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> .

### Continuous Rapid Atrial Pacing

When atrial flutter is interrupted by the procedures just described but recurs with unacceptable frequency, continuous atrial pacing at 400 to 600 beats · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> is used. This results in continuing atrial fibrillation with variable atrioventricular block. The ventricular rate can then be controlled by digoxin.

When premature atrial beats are continuous or recurrent despite pharmacologic treatment, continuous atrial pacing at about 200 to 230 beats · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> usually results in their suppression and a 2:1 atrioventricular conduction ratio with an acceptable ventricular rate.

# **5F Protocol for an Intubated Patient**

- 1. The ventilator is used with its air heating and humidifying devices and the valves for intermittent mandatory ventilation and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) functioning.
- 2. The patient has a well-positioned and well-secured orotracheal tube in place or, in infants and young children (for greater security and comfort) and adults in whom postoperative ventilation for more than 24 hours is likely, a well-positioned and well-secured nasotracheal tube in place (see Chapter 4).
- 3. Initially the fractional concentration of oxygen (FIO2) is set at 0.6, tidal volume (VT) at 12 to 20 mL · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , and intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) at 12 to 14 breaths · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in adults, 20 to 25 breaths · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in older children, 30 breaths · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in young children, and 30 to 40 breaths · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in infants. End-inspiratory pressure should normally be <40 cm H2O. In all situations, *visual, palpatory, and auscultatory observation* of the patient's chest must be used to confirm that VT is adequate for good air movement in and out of the lungs. These observations must be made whenever the patient becomes restless or agitated or there is any other reason to suspect inadequate gas exchange. Except in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease and those in whom the Glenn or Fontan operation has been performed, PEEP of 5 to 10 cm H2O (4 cm H2O in patients < 4 years old) may be used.
- 4. When the patient is admitted to the ICU, baseline blood gas analysis is obtained and ventilatory parameters are adjusted accordingly. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation by use of a digital infrared sensor is advisable in most patients. In adults, additional arterial blood gas analyses are not done routinely thereafter unless there is a change in clinical status. In neonates and children, more frequent arterial blood gas analyses are usually necessary.

- 5. A supine portable chest radiograph is obtained upon arrival in the ICU and reviewed by a physician for placement of the tip of the endotracheal tube; the presence of pneumothorax, atelectasis, vascular congestion, or gastric distention; and size of the mediastinal silhouette. The chest radiograph is routinely repeated the first postoperative morning.
- 6. Turning of the patient and sterile suctioning of the airway are performed each hour to clear retained secretions and minimize atelectasis. Suctioning is performed after hand bagging with 100% oxygen, hyperventilation for several breaths, and instillation of 1 to 5 mL of sterile saline solution down the endotracheal tube (see Section IV, "General Care of Neonates and Infants," for discussion of endotracheal tube suctioning in these patients). Suctioning is followed again by hand bagging with 100% oxygen. *The length of the endotracheal tube must be known* so that the suctioning catheter can be passed with certainty beyond the tube into the trachea.
- 7. In patients without severe preoperative pulmonary dysfunction, criteria for extubation include:
  - a. Patient awake and alert, indicating recovery from anesthesia and ability to protect his or her airway
  - b. Satisfactory hemodynamic state
  - c. Absence of important drainage from chest tubes
  - d. Arterial PO2 ≥ 70 mmHg or SaO2 > 90% to 92% (in the absence of intracardiac right-to-left shunting) on IMV of 6 breaths · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and FIO2 of 0.40
  - e. Spontaneous respiratory rate < 25 breaths · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in adults, < 40 breaths · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in young children, and < 50 breaths · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in infants
  - f. Absence of increased work of breathing (use of accessory respiratory muscles)
  - g. Normal PaCO2 and pH (PaCO2 may be somewhat elevated with a normal pH, if metabolic alkalosis is present)

# **5G Protocol for Oliguria**

#### Indication

Urine output in the early postoperative period of <0.5 to 1.0 mL · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in infants and children and <0.5 mL · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (30-35 mL · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) in adults.

### Rationale

To reverse the nearly universal occurrence of fluid retention following cardiopulmonary bypass.

### Treatment

- 1. Exclude low cardiac output as the cause of the oliguria.
- 2. Insert a urinary catheter if not already in place.
- 3. Administer a diuretic:
  - a. *Furosemide:* 1 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> for infants and children and 20 to 40 mg for adults administered intravenously (IV) as a bolus. Usually, no greater diuretic response is elicited with higher doses. However, doses of up to 180 to

240 mg may be necessary in patients with chronic heart failure, cirrhosis, and the nephrotic syndrome.

- i. The expected result is at least a doubling of the urine output over 2 to 3 hours.
- ii. If the diuresis is inadequate, other diuretics may be used in adults.
- b. *Ethacrynic acid:* 50 to 100 mg IV in 50 mL of solute over 30 minutes; ototoxicity occurs in 2% to 3% of patients.
- c. *Bumetanide:* 0.5 to 2 mg IV over 1 to 2 minutes
- d. *Torsemide:* 10 to 20 mg IV as a bolus
- e. A continuous infusion of the diuretics just mentioned may be safer and more effective in some patients. This is usually given after a bolus if the diuretic effect is not sustained. Furosemide is given at an initial infusion rate of 5 mg · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , increasing to 20 mg · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> if necessary. The equivalent dose of bumetanide is 0.5 mg · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , increasing to 1 mg · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ; and for torsemide, 5 mg · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , increasing to 10 mg · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> .

# **5H**

# **Protocol (Interim Measures) for a Serum K**<sup>+</sup> **Level** > **5.5 mEq · L**<sup>−</sup>**<sup>1</sup> from Acute Renal Failure**

- 1. Give glucose and insulin solution intravenously (IV). For adults, mix 20 units of regular insulin in 50 mL of 50% dextrose and give IV over 10 minutes. For children and infants, mix 0.5 mL of regular insulin per kilogram of body weight in 2 mL of 25% dextrose per kilogram and give IV over 10 minutes.
- 2. Administer a sodium polystyrene sulfonate enema. For adults, mix 50 g in 200 mL of sorbitol or 20% dextrose, and give as a retention enema; hold for 30 minutes, then remove; repeat hourly as necessary. For children and infants, give 1 g · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and 10 to 50 mL of sorbitol as a retention enema (total volume of sorbitol may be increased
- up to about 150 mL for children up to about 10 years of age).
- 3. Give 1 mEq · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> sodium bicarbonate IV for infants and children. For adults, give 1 ampule (44 mEq) IV.
- 4. If potassium levels exceed 6.5 mEq · L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and the patient is not receiving digoxin, give 10 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> of IV calcium chloride for infants and small children, and about 200 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> for adults, to decrease the cardiovascular effects of hyperkalemia.
- 5. If these measures do not result in a potassium level < 5.5 mEq · L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , nephrology consultation should be obtained.

# **5I Protocol for Seizures in Infants and Children**

# General Comments

Generalized or focal seizures are an infrequent but potentially serious occurrence following cardiac surgery in infants and children. In such cases a number of etiologies are possible (e.g., metabolic; infectious; cerebral edema, embolism, or hemorrhage; decreased cerebral perfusion), but in most patients no specific causative factor is identified. The following protocols outline initial evaluation to identify possible correctable causes and describe an initial treatment regimen. In most cases, a consultation is obtained with a neurologist knowledgeable about cardiac surgical patients. A few generalizations are useful:

- 1. In infants and small children, whether the seizure is generalized or focal is not helpful diagnostically.
- 2. Respiratory arrest, discoordinate respiratory activity, or sudden inability to adequately mechanically ventilate can be an indication of seizure activity in infants. Additional evidence of seizures is usually present on detailed evaluation.
- 3. After initial control of seizures, anticonvulsant therapy should be continued through the recovery period. Decisions regarding long-term therapy are made by the neurologist or pediatric cardiologist before hospital discharge.
- 4. Most children having a seizure in the early postoperative period will not have a chronic seizure disorder.
- 5. Choreiform movements are more serious symptoms than are seizures and are more apt to persist.
- 6. Because of its potential to cause cardiorespiratory depression and its short duration of action, diazepam is best avoided as an anticonvulsant unless the patient is being artificially ventilated.

### Initial Evaluation and Treatment

- 1. At the onset of a seizure, arterial blood gases and pH; serum glucose, calcium, and electrolytes; cardiac index; and body temperature are determined.
- 2. Interventions are made in an attempt to correct:
  - a. pH < 7.25 or > 7.50; PaCO2 < 25 mmHg; PaO2 < 80 mmHg; and base deficit > 10 to 15 mEq · L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . (In some patients, prompt control of seizures will correct low values.)

- b. Serum glucose level < 40 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in infants and < 60 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in older children (see "Fluid, Electrolyte, and Caloric Intake" in Section II)
- c. Serum calcium level < 7 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in infants and < 8 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in older children
- d. Serum sodium level < 125 mEq · L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> *.* Usual management in this situation is restriction of salt and water intake.
- e. Cardiac index < 2.0 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup>
- f. Body temperature > 38.6°C (>101.5°F)

#### Initial Anticonvulsant Therapy

When seizures are first noted, steps are taken to terminate them or, if they are no longer present, prevent their recurrence while the chemical and other variables are being determined.

- 1. Give:
  - a. 0.1 to 0.2 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> of diazepam intravenously (IV) and
  - b. 15 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> of phenobarbital IV over 5 to 10 minutes as a loading dose.
- 2. If seizures are not controlled by these measures, additional doses of diazepam (if the patient is being ventilated) may be used. (The full effect of the loading dose of phenobarbital may not be apparent for several hours, but if problems continue at this stage, consider giving a further 5 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> .)
- 3. If there has been spontaneous termination of seizure activity and prevention of recurrence is desired, omit step la and proceed to step 1b.
- 4. Continuing major seizures will rarely be a problem. If they are, a loading dose of phenytoin (20 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> orally) is given, followed by maintenance with 3 to 4 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · day<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> given orally.
- 5. An alternative, especially when seizures interfere with effective ventilatory support, is paralysis with pancuronium.

### Maintenance Anticonvulsive Therapy

Administration of phenobarbital (2.5 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · 12 h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) can be instituted 12 to 24 hours after giving the initial loading dose.

# **5J Protocol for Autotransfusion**

- 1. Several commercial chest drainage systems that accommodate autotransfusion are available. The two general types are (1) those that transfuse shed blood directly from the drainage system and (2) those that contain a drainage receptacle (a collapsible bag) that is manually transferred as an independent infusion setup.
- 2. A filter is optional.
- 3. Often there is a threshold for autoinfusion (i.e., drainage > 100 mL in adults).
- 4. A time limit for duration of autotransfusion is set for 4 to 6 hours.
- 5. Reinfusion of shed blood is governed by:
  - a. Amount of drainage
  - b. Atrial pressure limits

- 6. With either system, the total volume of chest drainage must be noted. This is a simple arithmetic sum of volume currently occupying the chest drainage reservoir plus the amount of chest drainage autotransfused. This total is noted hourly.
- 7. Contraindications to autotransfusion include:
  - a. Infectious endocarditis or other infection
  - b. Exogenous chemicals in the mediastinum
    - i. Disinfectants
    - ii. Topical antibiotics
    - iii. Hemostatic agents
    - iv. Biological glue
  - c. Hematologic abnormalities (e.g., sickling, diffuse intravascular coagulation, hemolysis)

# **5K Protocol for Intravenous Fluids**

In adults and children (>2 years of age or >13 kg in weight):

- 1. Day of operation:
  - a. 500 mL of 5% glucose in water · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> · 24 h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup>
  - b. 10 mEq of K<sup>+</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> · 24 h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup>
- 2. First and second postoperative days:
  - a. 750 mL of 5% glucose in water · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> · 24 h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup>
  - b. 20 mEq of K<sup>+</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> · 24 h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup>
- 3. Third postoperative day:
  - a. 750 mL of 5% glucose in water ⋅ m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ⋅ 24 h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup>
- or 1100 mL of 5% glucose in one-quarter-
- b. 350 mL of 5% glucose in saline solution ⋅ m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ⋅ 24 h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup>
- strength saline solution <sup>⋅</sup> <sup>m</sup><sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> <sup>⋅</sup> 24 h } <sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup>
- c. 10 mEq of K<sup>+</sup> ⋅ m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ⋅ 24 h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup>
- 4. If oral intake has not been established on the third postoperative day, consider gavage feeding or intravenous (IV) hyperalimentation.

In infants and small children (<2 years old or <13 kg in weight):

- 1. Day of operation:
  - a. Calculate patient's saline requirement.
    - i. 250 mL · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> · 24 h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> are required.

- ii. If this is 75 mL or less for the individual patient, use only balanced salt solution for flushing4 the arterial catheter; if it is 75 to 150 mL, use balanced salt solution for flushing the arterial and left atrial catheters; if it is >150 mL, flush the arterial, left atrial, and right atrial (and, if present, pulmonary artery) catheters with balanced salt solution.
- iii. Give no additional sodium-containing fluids if step ii supplies the patient's needs. Otherwise, subtract the amount in step ii from the requirement and give the difference.
- b. Calculate the patient's water requirement.
  - i. 500 mL · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> · 24 h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> of 10% glucose in water are required.
  - ii. Subtract 72 mL · the number of intracardiac recording catheters being flushed with 10%

<sup>4</sup> An automatic, very slow (3 mL · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> or 72 mL · 24 h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), continuous infusion system for all devices attached to pressure transducers is used. The solution flushing the arterial needle must be a heparinized balanced salt solution to prevent arterial spasm and pain. When salt restriction is important, as in infants, a glucose solution can be used for flushing the other pressure lines.

glucose in water from the amount in step i, and order that amount.

- c. Give no potassium in the fluids.
- 2. Days thereafter:
  - a. Calculate patient's saline requirement.
    - i.  $250 \text{ mL} \cdot \text{m}^{-2} \cdot 24 \text{ h}^{-1}$  are required.
    - ii. Proceed as in 1a.
  - b. Calculate patient's water requirement.
    - i.  $750 \text{ mL} \cdot \text{m}^{-2} \cdot 24 \text{ h}^{-1}$  of 10% glucose are required.
    - ii. Subtract 72 mL · the number of intracardiac catheters being flushed with 10% glucose in

water from the amount in step 1, and order that amount.

- c. Give no potassium in the IV fluids.
- 3. If oral intake has not been established on the third postoperative day, consider gavage feeding or IV hyperalimentation.

Note that when medications such as lidocaine, catecholamines, and sodium nitroprusside are administered, the amount of fluid thereby infused must be determined and subtracted from the daily fluid requirement.

# 5L

# Protocol for Metabolic Acidosis

#### Indication

Metabolic acidosis exists if the base deficit is > 2 mEq  $\cdot$  L<sup>-1</sup> and pH is <7.35 or PaCO<sub>2</sub> is <30 mmHg.

#### Rationale

Treatment is directed only at the extracellular fluid, and a conservative dose of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> is given because more can easily be administered if needed.

Extracellular fluid volume = 30% body weight (kg)

Base deficit  $(mEq \cdot L^{-1}) \cdot 0.3 \cdot body$  weight (kg) = total extracellular base deficit

#### **Treatment**

- 1. Administer NaHCO<sub>3</sub> so that the amount of Na<sup>+</sup> (mEq) equals half the total extracellular base deficit.
- 2. Remeasure base deficit in 30 to 60 minutes and repeat treatment if indicated.

Note that in acute reduction of cardiac output or cardiac arrest, much larger doses of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> are indicated (44 mEq for adults, 1 mEq  $\cdot$  kg<sup>-1</sup> for infants and children).

# **5**M

# Protocol for Hyperthermia

#### Indication

Hyperthermia exists if rectal temperature is  ${\geq}38.3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $({\geq}101^{\circ}F).$ 

#### **Rationale**

Hyperthermia increases metabolic demands and thus myocardial oxygen consumption. Severe hyperthermia (central temperatures  $\geq 41.1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}~[\geq 106^{\circ}\mathrm{F}])$  may permanently and severely damage the brain.

#### **Treatment**

- 1. If rectal temperature is ≥38.3°C (≥101°F), give acetaminophen as a rectal suppository every 4 hours. The dose in infants and children is 10 mg ⋅ kg<sup>-1</sup> (rounded to the nearest 30 mg), and in adults, 650 to 1300 mg.
- 2. Consider using a cooling blanket or cold syringing and a fan or ice bags applied to the body.
- 3. If rectal temperature is  $\geq 39.4$ °C ( $\geq 103$ °F):
  - a. Insert esophageal temperature probe for continuous monitoring of central temperature and intensify efforts

- to improve cardiac output. Check for possible transfusion reaction.
- b. If esophageal temperature is ≥39.4°C (≥103°F):
  - i. Make preparations for peritoneal dialysis with room temperature or cooled dialysate, to be initiated if simpler measures do not *promptly* control hyperthermia.
  - ii. Give acetaminophen as in step 1.
  - iii. Give dexamethasone, 0.25 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> IV, then 0.1 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> IV every 6 hours.
- 4. Give sodium nitroprusside, 1 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , to increase peripheral heat loss if arterial pressure remains acceptable with this drug; if inotropic agents are necessary, give preference to amrinone and isoproterenol.
- 5. Abolish muscular heat production, particularly when an infant is restless, by paralyzing with pancuronium (0.1 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ).
- 6. Continue efforts to improve cardiac output.

# **5N Protocol for Infant Feeding**

Infants can rapidly develop a profoundly catabolic state after major surgery. Caloric intake should be raised to adequate levels as soon as possible after operation.

When respiratory assistance via an endotracheal tube continues into the third postoperative day, gavage feeding is begun unless specific contraindications exist. In extubated infants, weakness and underdevelopment may prevent proper feeding and result in aspiration, making intermittent gavage feeding necessary. The steps are as follows:

- 1. As a precaution, prepare the endotracheal suction catheter for immediate use.
- 2. Check to be certain that the nasogastric tube is in the stomach; if intermittent gavage is to be used, a feeding catheter is inserted for each feeding and then removed.
  - a. Aspirate the tube. If stomach contents are not obtained or if large quantities of air with a little mucus are obtained, the tube is probably in the trachea.
  - b. While listening over the stomach with a stethoscope, inject a little air and listen for the typical noise.
  - c. Persistent coughing suggests that the tube is in the trachea.
  - d. Absence of a normal cry suggests the tube is in the trachea (steps a, b, and d apply to patients without an endotracheal tube).
- 3. If these checks indicate the tube is in the stomach, and if aspiration does not reveal >10 to 15 mL of fluid in the stomach, initial feedings can be begun. Feedings are injected slowly over 2 to 3 minutes or allowed to enter by gravity, preferably with the infant sitting upright. Otherwise, the infant is placed on his or her right side, with the head inclined to at least a 15-degree angle.
- 4. Gavage feeding is given *every 3 hours* on the following schedule:
  - a. Give sterile water, 10 to 15 mL × 1.
  - b. If well tolerated, give 10% dextrose in water, 30 mL × 1.

- c. If well tolerated and residual is <5 mL, give SMA-20 or equivalent formula, 30 mL × 8; if well tolerated, give SMA-20 in increasing amounts.
- 5. If needed:
  - a. Consider giving SMA-27 (27 calories per ounce) if diarrhea is not present.
  - b. Consider continuous drip infusion to avoid a bolus effect (residual fluid in the stomach is aspirated and measured every 2 hours).
