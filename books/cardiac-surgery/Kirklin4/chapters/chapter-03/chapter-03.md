To whatever extent possible, injury to the myocardium must be avoided during operations utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). During these operations, alterations of myocardial blood flow and oxygen demand are often imposed that, unmodified, might injure cellular energetics and morphology. We have chosen to call the following general discussion one of *management* rather than *protection* of the myocardium. Most efforts at management will result in protection of function. However, some techniques at times result in injury; at other times perhaps one or another technique may improve myocardial function. Almost all the techniques of myocardial management introduced in the past are in use today by one or more surgical groups, and at this time there is little secure evidence that one method is superior to another, or that the same method is optimal under all circumstances.F9 This chapter is written, nonetheless, with the bias that few if any methods currently available perfectly protect the heart from the damaging effects of an appreciable period of global myocardial ischemia, but that such a method may evolve with additional knowledge. Emphasis is given to methods that are currently satisfactory.

## HISTORICAL NOTE

In the early years of cardiac surgery, little mention was made of the possibility that fatal or nonfatal low cardiac output in the early postoperative period was related to damaging effects of the cardiac operation itself. Indeed, in two reviews of complications of open heart operations published in 1965W2 and 1966,R27 early postoperative low cardiac output was discussed extensively, but no mention was made of myocardial necrosis as a complication of the surgery or as a cause of low cardiac output, nor of temporary depression of myocardial function (stunning) as a result of the operation itself. Then, in 1967, Taber, Morales, and Fine described scattered small areas of myocardial necrosis, estimated to involve about 30% of the left ventricular myocardium, in a group of patients dying early after cardiac operations, and implicated this as the etiology of the patients' low cardiac output.T1 Najafi and colleagues showed in 1969 that acute diffuse subendocardial myocardial infarction was found frequently in patients who died early after valve replacement; these investigators suggested this was related to methods of intraoperative management of the myocardium.N1 They discussed the possibility that disturbances of the myocardial oxygen supply/demand ratios might be implicated, and that proper perfusion of the subendocardial layer of the myocardium was a particular problem during CPB.

When coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) began during the early 1970s, cardiologists and cardiac surgeons soon noted that a disturbingly high proportion of surgical patients developed a transmural myocardial infarction perioperatively (immediately before, during, or within 24 hours of operation).B38 Although first widely publicized in connection with CABG, development of transmural myocardial infarction was soon shown to be a complication of cardiac surgery in general. In 1973, in a consecutive series of patients with normal coronary arteries who had undergone various open cardiac operations, Hultgren and colleagues documented a 7% occurrence of acute transmural myocardial infarction.H15 These investigators recognized that "there is clearly an urgent need to further improve the protection of the heart during [cardiac] surgery." Various autopsy studies have confirmed that acute transmural myocardial infarction, as well as scattered myocardial necrosis and confluent subendocardial necrosis, can occur after cardiac surgery in the presence of normal coronary arteries.R12 The rarely occurring extreme manifestation of ischemic damage, "stone heart,"C18 was recognized at about that time and has been confirmed to be essentially a massive myocardial infarction developing during reperfusion.K2,L8

Development of knowledge in this area was facilitated by improved methods of identifying myocardial necrosis during life and, to some degree at least, quantifying its extent. Electrocardiographic criteria for diagnosing transmural myocardial infarction and ischemic changes were clarifiedR18 and applied to postoperative patients. Appearance of cardiacspecific enzymes in plasma was shown to correlate well with other evidence of myocardial necrosis,O4,R16 and their concentrations were shown to correlate directly with amount of muscle that had become necrotic, as judged by other criteria.K4,K8 Isoforms of troponin I and T, sensitive and somewhat specific serum markers of myocardial injury following CPB,C1,M2,T2 were found to be related to duration of ischemic time during cardioplegia, and elevated serum levels were associated with occurrence of delayed post-clamp recovery of ventricular function.K16 Radionuclide imaging identified the presence and extent of perioperative myocardial infarctions.R9

With these methods, a number of clinical studies have supported the finding of autopsy studies that myocardial necrosis is an important and frequent complication of conventional cardiac surgery. In 1974, the frequency of myocardial necrosis in patients convalescing well was demonstrated in a study of isolated aortic valve replacement.S4 Although hospital mortality was low (2%), 15% of the patients developed electrocardiographic evidence of transmural myocardial infarction, and 70% developed isoenzymatic evidence of myocardial necrosis. In 1974, it was shown that even after the short and simple operation for repair of an uncomplicated atrial septal defect, both adult patients and children developed isoenzymatic evidence of myocardial necrosis. Myocardial necrosis was demonstrated by enzymatic methods in children undergoing surgery for a number of different congenital cardiac defects.N7

In a 1975 study, early postoperative cardiac output was reported to be inversely proportional to the extent of myocardial necrosis, and thus the amount of myocardial necrosis was a determinant of the early postoperative condition of the patient and of the probability of survivalR8 (Fig. 3-1). Subsequently, it became clear that *myocardial stunning* also occurs after cardiac surgery, as well as after regional myocardial ischemia from coronary artery disease.B31 This also results in a period of low cardiac output of variable duration, albeit without myocardial necrosis in some patients.

It is difficult to identify the individual who first thought about special methods of myocardial management to protect the heart itself from damage during operations. Probably the first special method was retrograde coronary perfusion for surgery on the aortic valve, reported by Lillehei and colleagues in 1956,L10 and subsequently by Gott and colleagues.G7 "Elective cardiac arrest" was advocated by Melrose in 1955,M13 but its use at that time by Cleland in London was for intracardiac exposure, not myocardial management. The first deliberate attempts to protect the myocardium other than by simply perfusing it may have been made by Hufnagel and colleagues in 1961, who introduced profound cardiac cooling using ice slush,H14 and Shumway and Griepp and colleagues, who used ice cold saline for the same purpose.G9,S17,S18 Pharmacologic intervention, designed to provide myocardial protection against the damaging effect of ischemia, began during the 1970s as more knowledge of the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia evolved.N5 In the late 1970s, Clark and colleagues accumulated evidence of the favorable effect of nifedipine, a calcium channel blocking agent.C11,C12

The concept of reducing global myocardial ischemic damage by inducing immediate cessation of electromechanical activity—*cardioplegia*—was discussed generally by cardiac

surgeons during the late 1950s, during which time cold Melrose solution was used for this purpose at the Mayo Clinic. Lack of any apparent advantage led to abandoning the method. The concept remained largely unused in the United States for many years thereafter, but in Europe, Hoelscher, H9 Spieckerman and colleagues, Bretschneider and colleagues, Bretschneider and colleagues, Bretschneider and colleagues, Bretschneider and colleagues, Bretschneider and colleagues, Bretschneider and colleagues cardioplegia. Sondergaard reported clinical use of Bretschneider's solution in 1967, Sland in 1972 Kirsch and Rodewald and colleagues reported use of Kirsch cardioplegic solution in clinical cardiac surgery. Working with the latter group, Bleese and colleagues reported a hospital mortality in 1979 of 12% among 26 patients undergoing complex operations with cold procaine-magnesium cardioplegia and global

myocardial ischemic times greater than 150 minutes. B16 About the same time, Hearse and Braimbridge and their colleagues in London were exploring induction of reversible cardiac arrest B18 and its clinical application. Gay and Ebert studied and advocated potassium-induced cardioplegia in 1973, G14 as did Roe and colleagues in 1977. R15 Randomized trials soon confirmed the advantages of cold cardioplegia. C17 Buckberg identified blood as the optimal cardioplegic vehicle in 1979. B12 In the 1990s Wechsler, Damiano, and others began experiments using concepts of membrane hyperpolarization (nearer the resting state) via adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K+ channels rather than hyperkalemic cell membrane depolarization C15, L1; aprikalim and pinacidil are examples of K+ channel openers. M18

In 1960, Danforth, Naegle, and Bing showed the rapidity with which myocardial energy supply is replenished after ischemia when electromechanical quiescence is continued for a few minutes into the reperfusion period. This key observation remained unused until Buckberg and colleagues in 1978 showed experimentally that improved outcome could be obtained through use of an initially hyperkalemic reperfusate. Subsequently, these investigators modified the reperfusate F7: For acutely energy-deficient hearts, they introduced warm induction of cardioplegia with an enriched, modified, hyperkalemic blood perfusate. Control of perfusion pressure during reperfusion and continuance of controlled reperfusion until full recovery were additional contributions to cardioplegic and reperfusion techniques. D5

The mode of delivery of the cardioplegic vehicle was the latest contribution to cardioplegic management. Buckberg<sup>D10</sup> in North America and Menasche<sup>M16</sup> in Europe documented the efficacy and safety of retrograde and combined antegrade-retrograde infusion in valvar and coronary surgery. Metabolic demands of the heart were reduced by approximately 85% by sustained potassium arrest, even at normothermia. Therefore, using the delivery concepts of Buckberg and Menasche, Lichtenstein<sup>1,7</sup> and Salerno<sup>S3</sup> reasoned that warm continuously delivered blood cardioplegia containing minimal amounts of potassium would provide adequate oxygen, substrate, and buffer to the arrested nonworking heart. They occluded the aorta and maintained the heart quiet and flaccid, but perfused.

## NEED FOR SPECIAL MEASURES OF MYOCARDIAL MANAGEMENT

#### Conditions during Cardiopulmonary Bypass

The heart of intact humans is perfused by blood, ejected from the left ventricle, that leaves the aorta via the right and left coronary arteries. Blood is continuously modified by the organism so as to be correct in its composition and free of damaging materials such as gaseous or particulate microemboli. The amount and distribution of myocardial blood flow (hence myocardial oxygen supply) are continuously regulated, primarily in response to myocardial oxygen demand. This flow is determined by coronary perfusion pressure (aortic pressure), tension in the various myocardial layers (related in part to ventricular wall thickness and size), and coronary vascular resistance depends on proper function of the coronary endothelial cells and underlying smooth muscle. The ratio between flow to the inner one fourth of the myocardium (subendocardial

layer) and that to the outer one fourth (subepicardial layer) in normal hearts with intact circulation is maintained at 1 or a little greater. Although blood flow to the subepicardial layer occurs during both systole and diastole, blood flow to the subendocardial layer occurs almost exclusively during diastole, because intramyocardial tension during systole closes the branches of the coronary arteries that pass perpendicularly through the myocardium to arborize in the subendocardium. The well-known vulnerability to ischemia of the left ventricular subendocardial layer in shock, ventricular hypertrophy, and coronary artery disease, as well as during cardiac surgery, is dependent in part on this relationship, but in part on other factors as well, including a higher rate of oxygen consumption in the subendocardial layer.B15

During CPB, the heart is deprived of most of these protective regulatory factors. During total CPB, blood enters the arterial system through a cannula in the ascending aorta or at a more distal point. It then passes retrogradely into the most proximal part of the aorta and is distributed through the right and left coronary ostia into the coronary arteries. Arterial pulse pressure is narrow (essentially nonpulsatile), and mean arterial blood pressure is variable. The heart is usually more or less empty and thus smaller than usual, thereby increasing intramyocardial tension and transmural and subendocardial vascular resistance, and decreasing flow to the subendocardial layer.A18,S24 The effect is particularly powerful in the small heart and hypothermic heart.S24 Ventricular fibrillation increases intramyocardial tension still more. Coronary vascular resistance during CPB is also affected by circulating vasoactive agents (see "Details of the Whole-Body Inflammatory Response" in Section II of Chapter 2). The perfusate is diluted blood of variable composition with highly abnormal physiochemical properties. The blood may contain microemboli of several kinds, and leukocytes and platelets with altered mechanical and humoral functions.

Thus, there is little reason to assume that the empty perfused human heart on CPB, even when beating, is managed optimally. Furthermore, clinical experience refutes that view.

#### Vulnerability of the Diseased Heart

In most patients undergoing cardiac surgery, coronary blood supply or the myocardium, or both, are not normal and are therefore particularly susceptible to ischemic and reperfusion damage. Hypertrophied ventricles have long been known to be particularly susceptible to ischemic and reperfusion damage.S7 This vulnerability is a result of several factors. Transmural gradients of energy substrate utilization are markedly elevated, increasing the vulnerability of the subendocardium to ischemic damage.B15 Xanthine oxidase levels are markedly elevated, increasing the opportunity for elaboration of oxygen-derived free radicals. Superoxide dismutase levels are markedly decreased, reducing the natural defenses against oxygen-derived free radicals.B9 Also, wall characteristics of the hypertrophied ventricle make reperfusion of the subendocardium even more difficult than under normal circumstances.

The heart of the patient with chronic heart failure is chronically depleted in energy charge1 and is particularly susceptible to additional acute depletion and damage during ischemia and reperfusion.

The hearts of experimental animals made cyanotic have been shown to be considerably more susceptible to ischemic and reperfusion damage than are normal hearts.J11 This may pertain also to severely ill, cyanotic patients. It is well known that the heart of a patient coming to the operating room in a hemodynamically unstable state or in cardiogenic shock is highly sensitive to the damaging effects of global myocardial ischemia.

Cardiac operations can be performed with the heart perfused and either beating, in ventricular fibrillation, or in diastolic arrest. However, the probability of a precise and complete surgical procedure without air embolization is greatest when the heart is bloodless and mechanically quiescent. These optimal conditions are provided by global myocardial ischemia, but they necessitate appropriate myocardial management to limit the damage that would otherwise result from the period of global myocardial ischemia. The changes associated with myocardial ischemia and those associated with reperfusion are not often discussed as separate events; much of the literature does not allow interpretation of one or the other as a separate event. In contrast, the surgeon, by his or her manipulations, has a unique opportunity to control and influence each separately. Therefore, the following discussion must, for strategic purposes, attempt to distinguish the role of ischemia from that of reperfusion.

## DAMAGE FROM GLOBAL MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA

Damage from a period of ischemia may result in a variable, and sometimes prolonged, period (many days) of both systolic and diastolic dysfunction without muscle necrosis.E2 This condition is termed *myocardial stunning*. B31,B32 A period of ischemia may also result in irreversible damage *(myocardial necrosis)*. Some investigators have obtained information indicating that this can develop in the subendocardium after as little as 20 minutes of normothermic ischemia.J3,J4 Others have obtained evidence that at least 6 hours of normothermic myocardial ischemia is compatible with myocardial cell survival throughout the myocardium.B12 Ischemic damage involves myocardial cells (myocytes), vascular endothelium, and specialized conduction cells (which, with many cardioplegic techniques, may be the last to recover).

Overall reviews of the damage from myocardial ischemia are available.H6,N4 Nayler and Elz stress the extreme heterogeneity among cells (and by implication among hearts) in the rate of progression of ischemic damage, as well as in the rapidity of the chain of events of ischemia (i.e., the switch from aerobic to anaerobic glycolysis occurs within seconds of onset of ischemia).N4

Although the phrase *global myocardial ischemia* is appropriately used to describe the situation during cardiac surgery when the aorta is clamped, some blood flow—originating in mediastinal arteries—continues from noncoronary collaterals.B33 Generally, noncoronary collateral flow is less than 3% of total coronary flow. However, in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease, advanced ischemic heart disease, extensive pericarditis, and other conditions, coronary collateral flow may be sufficient to initiate electromechanical

*Energy charge* describes the energy-producing capacity of the particular combination of adenine nucleotides present in mitochondria and cytoplasm of myocytes of a particular heart. Normally, it is 0.85. It would be 1.0 if the nucleotides were present only as ATP, but 0.0 if they were present only as adenosine monophosphate.A3,A22

activity in the heart rendered quiescent by cardioplegia, but insufficient to prevent continuing and important ischemia.

#### Myocardial Cell Stunning

Surgeons have long known that patients may have severely depressed cardiac function after cardiac surgery without evidence of myocardial necrosis, and that the duration of the depressed function may last minutes or days. Some instances of delayed recovery of cardiac function after cardiac surgery may be related to initially incomplete reperfusion of the microvasculature of the heart. However, myocardial stunning probably underlies at least some instances of prolonged postoperative low cardiac output. In general, stunning occurs after a state of acutely diminished myocardial blood flow followed by adequate reperfusion. After establishing "normal" blood flow, there remains for a time diminished contractility; that is, perfusion/contractility mismatch.2

Myocardial stunning, which can follow even brief periods of myocardial ischemia, is characterized by systolic and diastolic dysfunction in the absence of myocardial necrosis.B32,E2,P4 Myocardial stunning has been attributed to reduced oxygen consumption, which might protect against myocardial necrosis. This hypothesis is denied by the fact that stunned myocardium has a high, not low, oxygen consumption.B10 Some have suggested that stunning may be a consequence of abnormal energy transduction or utilization secondary to depletion of high-energy phosphates. Stunned myocardium, however, responds to inotropic stimulation, indicating the presence of adequate ATP to produce active contraction.E3 Myocardial stunning, then, is a form of myocardial cell damage caused by ischemia and reperfusion.B18 Stunning, like myocardial necrosis, tends to begin in the subendocardial layers and progress outward; recovery during reperfusion proceeds in the reverse direction.B20

Current information makes it unlikely that stunning is the result of prolonged postischemic depletion of myocardial cell energy charge.B31 It does not appear to be the result of a continuing postischemic impairment of coronary blood flow or coronary reserve.J5 It may be caused in part by the release of oxygen-derived free radicals, presumably by activated neutrophils and probably occurring to a major degree during the first few minutes of reperfusion.B18,B21 Experimentally, introduction of superoxide dismutase and catalase (free radical scavengers) before an ischemic period results in nearly full restoration of contractile indices upon reperfusion, compared with prolonged depression in controls.P11 Stunning may be caused in part by an ischemia-induced increase in influx of calcium into the myocardial cells.M4,P10,P12 This possibility has led to the hypothesis that cardiac stunning is related to a defect in calcium-mediated excitation-contraction (EC) coupling that results from the excess calcium.B31 This hypothesis must be reconciled with evidence that after short periods of ischemia, excess intracellular calcium that rapidly accumulates with the onset of reperfusion soon leaves the cells.M4

Techniques of myocardial management designed to minimize myocardial necrosis are probably effective against myocardial stunning as well. Thus, for optimal results, these techniques should be used even when the period of global myocardial ischemia is less than that anticipated to result in myocardial cell death.

## Myocardial Cell Necrosis

Myocardial necrosis after cardiac surgery is the end stage of a complex process initiated by the onset of global myocardial ischemia, maintained by continuing ischemia, and aggravated by reperfusion. The final link in the chain of events, reperfusion, can be favorably modified so as to prevent necrosis, unless the duration of myocardial ischemia is excessive; "excessive" in this context has not yet been defined.B30

Immediately after the onset of ischemia, contractile force declines rapidly, as does myocardial pH.C14,G1 Oxidative metabolism, electron transport, and ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation (which take place in mitochondria) decline rapidly. Some ATP is still produced by relatively inefficient anaerobic glycolysis. Fatty acid utilization is rapidly reduced, while fatty acid acyl-CoA derivatives accumulate because of continuing uptake of fatty acids by myocardial cells. Intracellular acidosis develops because of accumulation of lactate and protons in the myocardial cytoplasm, suppressing anaerobic glycolysis. These developments contribute to damage to the cell membrane and loss of control of cell size, with consequent cell swelling, intracellular accumulation of calcium, and other disturbances of membrane ion transport.L5 This entire process acutely diminishes myocardial energy charge and glycogen reserves, while adenosine, inosine, and other nucleotides that are the results of ATP catabolism and the building blocks for ATP repletion leave the cell. Ultrastructural changes during this early phase are limited to loss of glycogen granules and some intracellular and organelle swelling.

As the duration of ischemia lengthens, intracellular metabolic deterioration continues, still more fatty acids accumulate within the myocytes, and diastolic arrest occurs. Loss of control of sarcolemmal membrane permeability—which begins within 15 minutes of onset of ischemiaH4—continues, and nonspecific membrane permeability increases. Adenosine, lactate, and other small molecules leak still more rapidly out of the cell, as do cytoplasmic proteins and enzymes; these appear in the cardiac interstitium and in the lymph.L5 As macromolecules within myocardial cells are converted to smaller, more osmotically active molecules by ischemic metabolic conversion, cell swelling proceeds more rapidly.T12 Cellular metabolism and ATP production nearly cease, and glycogen stores are depleted.M20 As glycolysis and mitochondrial function are totally lost, cellular autolysis begins, and cell contents leak more extensively into the interstitial space and cardiac lymph.

In many laboratory preparations, as the depletion of ATP continues and finally reaches critical levels, *myocardial contracture* begins to occur.G6 The classic belief has been that once contracture is completed, functional recovery is suddenly more difficult, and the time to this end point has been an important criterion in many studies in isolated rat heart preparations.A11 However, the time to contracture (1) is

*Myocardial hibernation vs. myocardial stunning:* If stunning is characterized as a perfusion/contraction mismatch, hibernation is a perfusion/contraction match; in the latter, both are low.R4 Generally, hibernation is a chronic, potentially reversible state of segmental (less often, global) contractile dysfunction. Theoretically, dobutamine echocardiography, thallium scintigraphy, and positron emission tomography can distinguish hibernating from nonviable myocardium. However, the difference between stunned and hibernating segments may be vague. MarbanM3 suggests that a decrease in Ca2<sup>+</sup> transients at a cellular level is responsible for the contractile dysfunction in hibernation, whereas a decrease in myofilament Ca2<sup>+</sup> responsiveness accounts for the excitation-contraction decoupling seen in stunning.

**Figure 3-2 A,** Hypoxic endothelial cell activation. Hypoxia stimulates Weibel-Palade bodies to release P-selectin and activates nuclear factor (NF)-κB. NF-κB is translocated to nucleus, where it promotes transcription of E-selectin, intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), tissue factor, interleukin (IL)-8, and IL-1. IL-1 feeds back to promote more endothelial cell activation through activation of NF-κB. **B,** Neutrophil adhesion is a multistep process that involves contact between neutrophils and members of the selectin family of adhesion molecules (P-selectin, E-selectin) expressed on activated endothelium. These low-affinity bonds result in rolling and slowing of leukocytes. As this occurs, neutrophils become activated, and a firm bond forms between integrins on the leukocyte surface (i.e., CD 11/18) and adhesion molecules on the endothelium (i.e., ICAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule, platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule). **C,** No-reflow phenomenon. Hypoxia results in activation of endothelial cell layer, which promotes leukocyte adhesion and degranulation, endothelial swelling, platelet activation, microthrombosis, and increased vasomotor tone. This contributes to impaired microcirculatory flow, despite what appears to be adequate perfusion through the large epicardial arteries. Adherent neutrophils infiltrate underlying myocardium and promote lipid peroxidation, enzymatic degradation of membranes, calcium overload, and excitation-contraction uncoupling. Collectively, these events result in impaired myocardial function. Key: *LPS,* Lipopolysaccharide. (From Boyle and colleagues.B29)

highly species dependent, (2) is unknown but probably quite long in humans, and (3) in the rat heart, at least, has a greatly different implication in crystalloid vs. blood-perfused preparations.W1 The appearance of contracture does indicate that the content of ATP has been depleted to a critically low level. Contracture first develops in the subendocardium, because of its higher metabolic rate and consequent more rapid depletion of ATP.A15,B15,J9,L18,V4 Contracture develops more rapidly in hypertrophied than in normal heartsB15 and is delayed in its onset by hypothermia.

Where the process becomes truly irreversible along this course of events, and cell death becomes inevitable, is not known with certainty.

#### Endothelial Cell Damage

As in the case of myocytes, distinguishing between ischemic endothelial cell damage and reperfusion damage is difficult. Endothelial cell swelling develops during ischemiaS8 and becomes more prominent during reperfusion, and secretion of endothelial relaxing factor, as well as of endothelin, the constricting factor, is affected. Boyle and Verrier have reviewed the role of the endothelium in events associated with ischemia and reperfusionB29 (Fig. 3-2). There is endothelial cell activation following hypoxia, anoxia, or ischemia. Activated endothelial cells express proinflammatory properties, including induction of leukocyte adhesion molecules. These result in neutrophil accumulation at the arterial wall and release of oxygen-derived free radicals. Intracellular adhesion molecules (ICAM) are upregulated (see Fig. 3-2). Endothelial cell selectins (E and P) are also involved in the hypoxic inflammatory response and, theoretically, may ultimately contribute to small vessel occlusion (no-reflow) occasionally seen after myocardial ischemia. Impaired microcirculatory flow, membrane degradation, and enzyme dysfunction result then in poor mechanical function (see Fig. 3-2). After prolonged ischemia, endothelial cell damage is marked and apparent during reperfusion with unmodified blood and without control of pressure, with sufficient endothelial cell damage that necrosis occurs and large intraluminal projections develop, some of which are cast off into the lumen.K13 Thus, myocardial endothelial cells probably also participate, along with other endothelial cells in the body, in the "whole-body inflammatory response" to CPB (see "Details of the Whole-Body Inflammatory Response" in Section II of Chapter 2).

These ischemic changes in the coronary vascular endothelium play an important role in changes in coronary vascular resistance that have been observed in humans during reperfusion after global myocardial ischemia,D5 and in the no-reflow phenomenon seen after prolonged ischemia, particularly in the inner half of the myocardium.K13 In children, cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-8 are liberated during CPBF4 and may contribute to neutrophil adhesion and migration. Burns and colleaguesB50 and Kilbridge and colleaguesK5 report endothelial expression of P-selectin, E-selectin, and ICAM in myocardial biopsies taken during cardioplegic ischemic arrest in infants undergoing complex repairs. However, the degree to which endothelial activation and related subsequent events contribute to impaired microcirculatory flow and myocardial dysfunction during cardiac surgery is unknown.

## Specialized Conduction Cell Damage

The specialized conduction cells become nonfunctional early in the course of global myocardial ischemia in humans; it may be speculated that their recovery takes longer than does recovery of myocytes. Some support for this is that 5 or so minutes after initially hyperkalemic reperfusion, the ventricular myocardium in some patients responds well and strongly to direct ventricular pacing, although it is quiescent with atrial pacing or without pacing. Then, after 5 or so more minutes, sinus rhythm may appear. Also, when blood cardioplegia and uncontrolled normokalemic reperfusion are used, about 50% of patients have atrioventricular (AV) conduction disturbances when CPB is discontinued.B3 This appears to be a form of specialized conduction cell stunning rather than necrosis, because these disappear by the time of hospital discharge in most of the patients in whom it had developed. Even third-degree AV block persisting as long as 2 months has been observed to give way to sinus rhythm.B3 Validation of this speculation remains to be obtained, however. These changes might also be ascribed to variation of specialized conduction fibers' sensitivity to chemical components of the cardioplegia infusate.O6

#### DAMAGE FROM REPERFUSION

The morphologic changes following normal blood reperfusion of ischemic myocardium have been authoritatively presented by Jennings and Reimer.J1 They stress the complexity of the process, including cell swelling, contraction band necrosis, calcium loading of mitochondria, accelerated washout of creatine kinase early in reperfusion, and the particular vulnerability of the subendocardium. It is clear that there can be no reperfusion damage in the absence of prior ischemia. What is not clear is whether there can be reperfusion damage in the absence of ischemic *damage*. R13 Clearly, limitation of the duration of ischemia and modification of the conditions during ischemia are fundamental to limiting reperfusion injury.

The following discussion assumes some degree of spontaneous ischemia (coronary obstructive disease) or induced ischemia (low blood flow or aortic clamping); it pertains to uncontrolled reperfusion, which is reperfusion by unmodified blood without control of pressure or flow.

#### Myocardial Cell Damage

The response of myocardial cells to uncontrolled reperfusion depends in large part on the time-related point along the pathway to cell death that has been reached during the ischemic period. Yet the critical point at which the "explosive cellular response" to uncontrolled reperfusion can be expected is not known with certainty. In the past, it has been defined (in the isolated rat heart) as the point at which contracture appears, a definition of little help in humans undergoing cardiac surgery, because the time to contracture—if it occurs—is unknown but probably quite long. Also, when the rat heart is blood perfused (rather than crystalloid perfused), reperfusion after contracture results in good return of function.W1

When uncontrolled reperfusion is initiated after global myocardial ischemia in cardiac surgery, the response may be only myocardial stunning. A more severe response consists of reperfusion arrhythmias, particularly ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. The more prolonged and the larger the area of myocardial ischemia, the more frequent, severe, and intractable the arrhythmias.B19 A still more severe response is the hard and fibrillating heart, sometimes termed *stone heart*. C18,H7,K2,L8 The *stone heart phenomenon* may involve only some regions of the heart, typically the basilar portion of the left ventricle and the subendocardium. This phenomenon indicates that the heart has undergone severe damage and may be considered to have approached the critical "point of no return." It has not necessarily reached this point, because the stone heart is, at least under some circumstances, capable of recovery. The histologic features of these advanced forms of reperfusion damage include disruption of the regular myofibrillar pattern and evident contraction bands.M5

Clearly, the strong influx of calcium into myocytes, and particularly its accumulation in mitochondria, are obvious and fundamental features of reperfusion injury.I2,N3,O5,S14,S15 Stiffness of cardiac muscle resulting from uncontrolled reperfusion after a period of ischemia is caused by the massive influx of calcium into mitochondria and cytoplasm of myocytes, as well as by edema and capillary disruption.B13 However, many other types of events are ongoing, most well underway within 1 or 2 minutes of uncontrolled reperfusion.

Chemotactic factors of cardiac subcellular origin, activated endothelial cells, activated complement fragments, such as C5a, and cytokines are generated locally in ischemic myocardium.D9,M6,R28 This process activates circulating neutrophils, which accumulate and play an important role in initiating and sustaining reperfusion injury.B34,C4,E7,M22 Neutrophils plug myocardial capillaries as reperfusion continues because of their large size and active adherence to ischemically damaged endothelial cells.E6 Leukocytes, and in particular neutrophils, release large amounts of oxygen-derived free radicals in these circumstances.H3,M10 Activated neutrophils also release arachidonic acid metabolitesM14 that cause endothelial injury, vasoconstriction, and platelet aggregation. During reperfusion, certain leukotrienes are also released from platelets and endothelial cells.I3,R29

Oxygen-derived free radicals generated during reperfusion represent one of the fundamental processes that produce damage.A13,P8 Oxygen-derived free radicals are characterized by presence of unpaired electrons and include superoxide (O2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the hydroxyl radical (OH). Normally, myocardial cells are constantly exposed to superoxide anions in very small amounts, produced in (1) mitochondria (where 95% of oxygen consumption occurs) during electron transport, (2) cell cytoplasm during prostaglandin synthesis and metabolism and oxidation of tissue catecholamines, (3) vascular endothelium by xanthine oxidase–catalyzed reactions, and (4) extracellular fluids by activated neutrophils. Normally, these very small amounts of oxygen-derived free radicals are well controlled. Superoxide dismutase, which is normally present in myocytes, catalyzes the transformation of superoxide anions to hydrogen peroxide and water; metabolism of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen is accomplished by either catalase or glutathione peroxidase, or both.A13

The very onset of uncontrolled reperfusion can produce large amounts of oxygen-derived free radicals because of profound alterations imposed on this exquisite system by ischemia. Ischemia progressively decreases the cellular levels of the scavenger superoxide dismutase and also increases metabolic end products of ATP catabolism, such as hypoxanthine and xanthine. These catabolites may participate in producing oxygen-derived free radicals by supplying free radical substrates to endothelial xanthine oxidase.A2 Also, during ischemia, normally present xanthine dehydrogenase is converted to xanthine oxidase. Superoxide anions are generated at the start of uncontrolled reperfusion. Xanthine oxidase is the catalyst for reoxygenation and metabolism of the considerable amounts of hypoxanthine and xanthine generated during ischemia. A chain reaction results, leading to the generation of other free radicals and of a direct attack by them on unsaturated fatty acids within cell membranes. As part of this chain reaction, iron plays a key role in converting relatively innocuous superoxide radicals into highly damaging hydroxyl radicals.B2 Peroxidation of membrane lipids has been shown to result in increased membrane permeability, decreased calcium transport into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and altered mitochondrial function,A13 setting the stage for myocardial stunning or necrosis.

## Endothelial Cell Damage

Reperfusion damage to the heart involves more than the myocytes. For example, myocytes surrounding a necrotic area of myocardium may be perfectly viable and functioning 1 hour after the start of reperfusion, only to become necrotic over the subsequent few hours.A14 This has been shown to be due to delayed closure of coronary arterioles and capillaries and to the resulting no-reflow phenomenon.

The endothelial cells of large coronary arteries appear to be little affected by the damaging effects of ischemia and reperfusion.Q1 The coronary microvasculature is profoundly affected, however, and the resultant endothelial dysfunction appears to develop rapidly with the onset of reperfusion.Q1,T13 This damage appears to be minimal after ischemia itself but is incited almost exclusively by reperfusion.Q1 In addition to changes in endothelial cell function, the endothelial cell swells, activated neutrophils and platelets aggregate and adhere to the endothelium, and microvascular obstruction can develop.A14,N8,V2

This rapidly induced reperfusion injury to the endothelial cells severely impairs normal endothelium-dependent relaxations to neutrophils and platelets as well as to thrombin, acetylcholine, and bradykinin.K20,M8,P5,V1 These alterations could play some role in the observed progressive increase in coronary vascular resistance during reperfusion. In addition, with damage to endothelial cells, smooth muscle beneath the cells is exposed, allowing additional mediators to induce direct smooth muscle contraction.

In addition to these phenomena, coronary vessels are compressed by myocardial areas with high wall tension and hemorrhage and by myocardial cell swelling. This all may lead to inhomogeneous distribution of the uncontrolled, unmodified blood reperfusate or actual "no-flow," further aggravating reperfusion injury in the clinical setting. These unfavorable events are particularly damaging after prolonged (>24 hours) cardiac preservation,S26 as may eventually be required for cardiac transplantation.

## Specialized Conduction Cell Damage

Little specific information is available about reperfusion injury to the specialized conduction cells.

## ADVANTAGEOUS CONDITIONS DURING ISCHEMIA

Advantageous conditions during ischemia delay the time required for the ischemic myocardium to reach the hypothetical *critical point* in the course of ischemic injury. This is classically considered the point at which uncontrolled, unmodified blood reperfusion produces explosive cell damage and accelerated myocardial necrosis, rather than recovery. For this discussion, it is this critical point that must be delayed. The common denominator may be delay in severe reduction of the energy charge of the myocardium.

Circumstances that decrease the rate of ATP utilization (or its surrogate, myocardial oxygen consumption) lengthen the *safe ischemic interval*. These circumstances include immediate cessation of electromechanical activity and hypothermia.F12 The interrelationships are such that a great advantage is obtained by reducing myocardial temperature from 37°C to 27°C, a lesser advantage by reducing temperature from 27°C to 17°C, and a still smaller advantage by reducing temperature further (Fig. 3-3).H8 However, for longer periods of arrest (6 hours), Rosenfeldt found an increase in protection with stepwise cooling from 20°C to 4°C.R20 In a different experimental preparation, Balderman and colleaguesB4 found less satisfactory ventricular performance after 120 minutes of ischemia at temperatures of 6°C and 10°C compared with 14°C and 18°C.

Preoperative enhancement of cardiac substrates seems advantageous, but has been little used in cardiac surgery to date. Myocardial glycogen content can be increased by an intravenous infusion of a glucose-insulin-potassium solution during the 12 hours preceding operation.L17,O3 This can be combined with continuous retrograde coronary sinus infusion of a similar solution during the ischemic period.L15,L16

Acute substrate enhancement before cold cardioplegia and ischemia by initial infusion of warm, hyperkalemic, modified and substrate-enriched blood has been shown to benefit hearts that have become energy depleted before the cardiac operation.R22,R25,R26 Continuation of the pressurecontrolled, warm, enriched blood infusion for a few minutes after the onset of asystole takes advantage of increased coronary flow and better distribution brought about by cardiac asystole.S1

Preischemic administration of drugs such as lidoflazine has been shown to be advantageous,F6,V7 although the mechanism of their favorable effect remains arguable (see "Drug-Mediated Myocardial Protection" later in this chapter).

Figure 3-3 Relation between duration of global myocardial ischemia and percentage recovery of left ventricular systolic function and between heart temperature during ischemic arrest and percentage recovery. Note linear relation between duration of ischemia and percentage recovery (indicated by circles, with standard error represented by vertical bars). Note also curvilinear relation between temperature and recovery, such that most of the advantage was obtained by temperature reduction to about 22°C. (From Hearse and colleagues. HB)

Preischemic myocardial conditioning may surface as an additional tactic to limit damage during an induced ischemic interval and as an adjunct to surgical myocardial management. S9,P9 The concepts of both ischemic preconditioning and postconditioning are well recognized in the science of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, but have not found general application in cardiac surgery. V6 Ischemic preconditioning refers to brief periods of cessation of coronary blood flow prior to the longer ischemic event, and ischemic postconditioning refers to brief periods of coronary blood flow cessation during the early period of reperfusion. Ischemic preconditioning appears to stimulate potent innate cardioprotective mechanisms that attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury. V8 The protective mechanisms have been linked to stimulation of myocyte adenosine receptors, T9,T10 reduction of inflammatory responses to reperfusion, D8,E8 attenuation of endothelial dysfunction during reperfusion, D3 reduction in tissue acidosis during ischemia, B1 and prevention of ischemia-induced cell apoptosis.<sup>L4</sup>

Similar mechanisms have been invoked for ischemic postconditioning. V8 Ischemia-induced cardiac preconditioning has been shown to reduce infarct size in  $dogs^{M24}$  and swine. Several reports suggest that in humans, prodromal angina may limit infarct size. K14,07 Adenosine activation and  $\alpha_1$ -adrenergic stimulation are two pathways suggested as mediators of preconditioning. B6,L13 Protein kinase C has been identified as at least one of the factors that when activated

by adenosine or phenylephrine results in protection by myocardial preconditioning in laboratory animals  $^{\rm M18,T14}$  (Fig. 3-4). Experimentally in sheep, preconditioning has been produced by CPB alone and the response suppressed by  $\alpha_{\rm l}$ -adrenergic blockade or adenosine receptor blocker.  $^{\rm B49}$ 

Because of its simpler application to cardiac surgery, *remote ischemic preconditioning* is the object of numerous clinical trials. It refers to myocardial protection against ischemic injury by inducing ischemia in a distant organ, such as skeletal muscle of the arm. B2,Z3 This, and the fact that a preconditioning factor can be transferred from animal to animal, suggests a humoral factor, although a mural component has been implicated as well. L9,L11 Remote ischemic preconditioning has been implemented during cardiac surgery simply by 3- to 5-minute cycles of upper-limb cuff inflation to 200 mmHg, separated by 5 minutes of cuff deflation. Clinical trials have thus far produced mixed results.

## ADVANTAGEOUS CONDITIONS DURING REPERFUSION

Advantageous conditions during reperfusion (1) minimize the persistence of myocardial stunning into the post-CPB period, (2) provide for optimal recovery of function of reversibly damaged myocardium, and (3) resuscitate myocytes that would otherwise have undergone necrosis.

Buckberg and colleagues evolved the methods and demonstrated the advantages of controlling reperfusion. F7,F8 These ideas constitute a clinically useful body of knowledge. In essence, the advantageous conditions consist of:

1. Maintaining electromechanical quiescence during the first 3 to 5 minutes of reperfusion to permit more rapid repletion of myocardial energy charge, minimize regional heterogeneity of reperfusion flow, minimize myocardial energy expenditure until recovery has been established, and minimize intracellular accumulation of calcium

- 2. Combating accumulated myocardial acidosis by controlling pH of the initial reperfusate and providing a large buffering capacity to permit more prompt morphologic, biochemical, and functional recovery
- 3. Minimizing damage from oxygen-derived free radicals
- 4. Reducing ionized calcium in the initial reperfusate to help minimize intracellular accumulation of calcium
- 5. Increasing availability of substrate for repletion of myocardial energy charge
- 6. Maintaining a low perfusion pressure (≈30 mmHg) during the first 60 to 120 seconds of reperfusion to minimize endothelial cell damage and swelling, during which time reactive hyperemia, usually present, allows this low pressure to be maintained with adequate volume and distribution of flow
- 7. Maintaining a flow sufficient to encourage nearuniform myocardial distribution of the reperfusate
- 8. Continuing control of reperfusion pressure and flow until myocyte, endothelial cell, and specialized conduction cell recovery is essentially complete

Specific comments about individual items follow, and the details of establishing these advantageous conditions during clinical cardiac surgery are described in "Cold Cardioplegia, Controlled Aortic Root Perfusion, and (When Needed) Warm Cardioplegic Induction" later in this chapter. New information continues to accumulate, and current practices must be changed whenever sufficient information becomes available to indicate the possibility of improving results by modifying methods.

## Blood

Blood as the reperfusion vehicle has been shown to be superior to crystalloid solutions.B42,C2,D1,E4,E5,F3,F13,K19,N10,R10,S12,S19,T4

The advantage is due in part to the red blood cell component, although it may not relate to the oxygen transport capacity of red blood cells.I1,J2 Among other things, red blood cells contain abundant oxygen-derived free radical scavengers, which have been shown to be important.J1 The minimal effective level of hematocrit in the reperfusate is 0.15 to 0.20.I1 The buffering capacity of blood proteins, especially their histidine and imidazole groups, is also advantageous.

#### Leukocyte Depletion

There is little doubt that activated leukocytes play an important role in reperfusion damage. Depletion of leukocytes from the blood reperfusate (by filtration) has been shown to reduce reperfusion injury considerably.C6 Leukocyte fillers are commercially available for pediatric and adult CPB circuits.

## Substrate

Addition of the amino acids L-glutamate and aspartate to solutions used to reperfuse the heart after an ischemic insult has been shown by Rosenkranz and by Buckberg and colleagues to be beneficial to metabolic and functional recovery.L2,L3,R22,R24 Their early work has been confirmed by Choong and GavinC9 and others.G5

Addition of adenosine during reperfusion was theorized to improve postischemic function; there is experimental support for its efficacy.B22 The delay in repletion of ATP after ischemic injury may well relate to lack of availability of adenosine, an important component of the process of rebuilding ATP stores,A2,R6,S27,V5 because it presumably converted to inosine and as such is washed out of cells during reperfusion.R16

## Hydrogen Ion Concentration

The initial reperfusate should contain adequate buffering capacity to combat the intracellular acidosis developed during the ischemic period (see "Blood" earlier in this section). Various buffering agents have been used, but hydroxymethyl aminomethane (Tris) and histidine have particularly favorable characteristics.B36,R14,T3

#### Calcium

During reperfusion, perfusate calcium content should be low to minimize the influx of calcium into potentially damaged myocytes.H12,Y1,Z1,Z2 The special effects of calcium in the neonatal and infant myocardium are discussed under "Neonates and Infants" under Special Situations and Controversies later in this chapter.

#### Potassium

Hyperkalemic reperfusion permits rapid repletion of ATPD2 and improved functional recovery, even in the face of ischemic contracture and myocardial accumulation of calcium.D6 It also promotes better myocardial blood flow.D7 Therefore, if controlled reperfusion is elected, the initial reperfusate should contain sufficient potassium to maintain electromechanical quiescence for at least 2 to 3 minutes, and preferably 5 to 10 minutes. The sufficient concentration is about 12 mmol · L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> .

The advantages of hyperkalemic reperfusion in clinical cardiac surgery have been confirmed in a randomized trial by Teoh and colleagues,T7 although these advantages may be difficult to demonstrate in low-risk patients undergoing uncomplicated CABG.F9,R11

#### Pressure

After a period of myocardial ischemia, coronary vascular endothelial cells are in a state in which they are easily damaged by high reperfusion pressure,O2,S5 but that state appears to be rapidly reversed by gentle reperfusion. Therefore, in clinical cardiac surgery, it is prudent to keep reperfusion pressure at about 30 mmHg for the first 60 to 120 seconds of reperfusion. Because of reactive hyperemia present at that time,D6 the reperfusion flow rate may nonetheless be large.

Some experimental studies have suggested that reperfusion pressure should be no higher than 50 mmHg, lest excessive myocardial edema develop; others have suggested that it may be as high as 100 mmHg. These differences may be the result of species differences. In a canine model, 1 hour of hyperkalemic reperfusion at 80 mmHg (with electromechanical quiescence) resulted in improved myocardial function with no more myocardial edema than from normokalemic reperfusion and rapid resumption of cardiac activity.A4 The importance of maintaining a sufficient coronary perfusion pressure at this stage has been well documented in the

Variation in coronary perfusion pressure is along horizontal axis, coronary flow rate (or inner/outer flow ratio) is along vertical axis, and columns represent endomyocardial, midmyocardial, and epimyocardial flow rates, and the inner/outer flow ratio. Note that as coronary perfusion pressure was reduced, perfusion of subendocardium progressively declined out of proportion to decline in other layers. Accordingly, the inner/outer ratio fell. Also, heterogeneity of flow increased with decreasing perfusion pressure (increased height of vertical bars). (From Aldea and colleagues.<sup>A7</sup>)

In that model, endocardial flow falls steeply when coronary perfusion pressure is reduced from 70 mmHg to 40 mmHg.<sup>A7</sup> Reduction of perfusion pressure to 20 mmHg leads to substantially increased heterogeneity of flow (Fig. 3-5). Clinical experience at UAB demonstrated the efficacy and safety, after the first 60 to 120 seconds, of maintaining reperfusion pressure between 50 and 75 mmHg, or at the preoperative diastolic arterial blood pressure of the patient, whichever was lower.<sup>D5,F10</sup>

#### Flow and Resistance

At the beginning of reperfusion, coronary resistance is very low, primarily as a result of reactive hyperemia, with additive effects from the cold temperature of the myocardium and the action of vasoactive substances, such as adenosine and lactic acid, that accumulate during the ischemic period. Thus, coronary blood flow is very high initially, even with low reperfusion pressure, but begins to fall within a few minutes of beginning reperfusion.

Subsequently, reperfusion flow is usually about 150 mL  $\cdot$  min $^{-1}$  in adults (about 100 mL  $\cdot$  min $^{-1}$   $\cdot$  m $^{-2}$  body surface area). This is about 40 mL  $\cdot$  min $^{-1}$   $\cdot$  100 g $^{-1}$  of heart muscle,  $^{D5}$  approximately half the value for normal hearts, but it appears to be adequate in the nonworking empty heart being reperfused under these conditions. In similar experimental models of normal hearts, flow after the initial hyperemia is higher and near control level.  $^{R21}$ 

## Temperature

In practice, the temperature of the reperfusate is initially about 35°C because of the characteristics of the heat exchange mechanism in the reperfusion circuit. After 2 to 3 minutes, the temperature rises to 37°C. There may be advantages to this gradual return to normothermia. Normothermia is advantageous to the normal function of enzyme systems.

## Suppression of Formation of Oxygen-Derived Free Radicals and Enhancement of Free Radical Scavengers

Allopurinol, a xanthine oxide inhibitor, given just before reperfusion, protects the previously ischemic isolated rat heart from reperfusion injury, presumably by slowing conversion of hypoxanthine and xanthine to superoxide ions. B17 Deferoxamine, given just before reperfusion, is also protective in experimental models, presumably by chelating iron and slowing formation of highly damaging hydroxyl radicals from superoxide radicals. B11,B17 The free radical scavengers superoxide dismutase and catalase protect against reperfusion injury when given before ischemia in experimental studies. G2,J7,P11,S16 Their use during early reperfusion has also been shown to be advantageous in experimental models. However, use of blood as the reperfusate, with its naturally occurring free radical scavengers, appears to obviate need for these agents in clinical cardiac surgery. J12

#### Duration

Recovery is not complete at the end of the hyperkalemic phase of controlled reperfusion. This may be because at this time (1) cellular recovery from ischemia is incomplete, and (2) inhomogeneity of myocardial perfusion probably persists. Controlled normokalemic reperfusion with adequate aortic root pressure should be continued until the heart is beating forcefully and is in sinus rhythm. This stage is usually reached 10 to 20 minutes after the beginning of reperfusion. In an experimental study, this length of time has been shown to be required for return of normal coronary vascular resistance, myocardial oxygen consumption, myocardial lactate levels, and ventricular function. R21 Although ATP levels have not yet returned to normal, R21 at this stage the heart itself is able to generate an adequate coronary perfusion pressure. Controlled aortic root reperfusion can therefore be discontinued by removing the aortic clamp, with proper precautions (see "Cold Cardioplegia, Controlled Aortic Root Reperfusion, and [When Needed] Warm Cardioplegic Induction" later in this chapter).

Reperfusion with the aorta clamped, as described above, has been called "hot shot."<sup>T7</sup> In practice, controlled reperfusion with the aorta clamped may not be necessary; reperfusion by pump flow supported by pharmacologic manipulation may be adequate.

## Adenosine

Adenosine is a potent coronary vasodilator with effects that can reverse coronary artery spasm, increase flow to the myocardial microvasculature during reperfusion, replenish highenergy phosphates, <sup>16</sup> and retard no-reflow effects through its antiplatelet and antineutrophil activity. Studies by Kim and

colleagues, Solenkova and colleagues, and others provide supporting evidence for the beneficial effect of adenosine during reperfusion.K6,S20 Four adenosine receptor subtypes have been identified that, when blocked, worsen postischemic reperfusion injury. Adenosine has a short half-life, but its biological activity is likely more prolonged. Adenosine administration (1.5 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) through the arterial cannula early after aortic clamp removal has been correlated with reduction in troponin 1 release and lower inotrope requirement.J6

## Ischemic Postconditioning

The proposed mechanisms of ischemic postconditioning are similar to ischemic preconditioning (see Advantageous Conditions During Ischemia earlier in this chapter). Although studies in cardiac surgery have shown a beneficial effect,L20 this technique has not gained general application in clinical cardiac surgery.

## METHODS OF MYOCARDIAL MANAGEMENT DURING CARDIAC SURGERY

The objective of any type of myocardial management during CPB should be limiting injury during ischemia by some combination of myocardial hypothermia, electromechanical arrest, washout, O2 and other substrate enhancement, oncotic manipulation, and buffering.

No single method of myocardial management is unequivocally the best. Many different methods are in use by surgeons obtaining good results. Surgeons necessarily make a decision as to the method to be used each time they perform a cardiac operation, often based on "preferences" rather than on rigorous comparisons between methods. A number of factors influence the surgeon's preference:

- 1. The surgeon's specific surgical techniques or operative sequencing that influence duration of aortic clamping
- 2. Strength of the surgeon's desire to have a quiet, bloodless heart
- 3. Strength of the conviction that cardiac surgery without myocardial necrosis or residual stunning is desirable and possible despite the added complexity to achieve these goals
- 4. Institutional environment
- 5. Costs

#### Continuous Normokalemic Coronary Perfusion

#### *Empty Beating Heart*

The earliest intracardiac operations were performed on normothermic, perfused, empty beating hearts.B47 Experimental studies had been interpreted as showing "normal left ventricular function" after 30 minutes to 3 hours of CPB with the heart perfused, empty, and beating.E1,N6

Current information indicates that the method is not ideal. Water tends to accumulate in the myocardium during CPB; as a result, ventricular distensibility in dog models is decreased by nearly 50% after 3 hours of CPB with the heart perfused, empty, and beating. The distribution of coronary blood is abnormal.A19 The change in myocardial compressive forces and left ventricular wall geometry impede intracoronary collateral flow supplying potentially ischemic areas of myocardium.M19 Occurrence of transmural myocardial infarction has been reported to be 15% when individual coronary artery perfusion was used for aortic valve replacement, with isoenzymatic evidence of myocardial necrosis in 70% of patients, proportions as high as in patients randomly assigned to cold ischemic arrest.S4

Despite these considerations, the method can serve well for various procedures and under certain circumstances may be combined with other methods of myocardial management.S3 For example, in elderly patients or those with extensive arteriosclerosis of the aorta, CABG using both internal thoracic arteries may be performed using stabilizersT5 without aortic clamping ("no-touch" technique) and CPB established by peripheral cannulation (e.g., axillary artery cannulation; see "Cardiopulmonary Bypass Established by Peripheral Cannulation" in Chapter 2). Tarakji and colleaguesT5 report that this technique reduces intraoperative and postoperative strokes in such patients (see "Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Without Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Chapter 7).

Mild or moderate whole-body, and thus cardiac, hypothermia are often combined with this method. McGoon and colleaguesM12 reported a series of 100 consecutive cases of isolated aortic valve replacement using this method, with no hospital deaths, evidence that, when properly used, the method can provide good results.M11

#### *Perfusion of Individual Coronary Arteries*

Individual coronary artery cannulation is necessary when perfusing the empty beating heart for surgery on the aortic valve.L12,M23 After CPB is established, the aorta is clamped (stopping flow of blood into the aortic root and ostia of right and left coronary arteries), and an incision is made into the first part of the ascending aorta. Small individual cannulae are placed into the ostia of right and left coronary arteries, and, by way of a separate pump, blood is infused into both. The cannulae tips are at least 3 to 4 mm long.

This technique works well in most patients, but it is not ideal. The tip of the cannula may extend beyond the bifurcation of the left main coronary artery, so that only the left anterior descending or circumflex artery is perfused. In about 1% of patients, these two arteries arise separately from the aortic sinus, making proper individual cannulation even more difficult. The prevalence of left dominant systems in patients with aortic stenosis secondary to congenital bicuspid valves is higher than normal; in left dominant systems, the left main coronary artery is shorter than normal,K18 again making individual coronary perfusion more difficult. In about 50% of patients, the conus artery supplying the infundibulum of the right ventricle arises separately from the aortic sinus and is not perfused by a cannula inserted into the right coronary ostium. Also, mechanical injury to the coronary ostia can occur whenever techniques of direct coronary ostial cannulation are used; this results in intraoperative myocardial infarction and late coronary ostial stenosis.C5,R5,S13

The method in practice is not without periods of global myocardial ischemia. One occurs between aortic clamping and initiation of right and left coronary artery perfusion. This interval varies, depending on the sequences elected by the surgeon, but can seldom be reduced below 2 to 3 minutes. If exposure for the operation is hampered by leakage of blood around the cannulae, coronary perfusion may have to be discontinued for short periods during the procedure.

When this method is used, the flow rate is of obvious importance, and information obtained for patients in whom the flow was delivered separately and directly into right and left coronary arteries during aortic valve replacement provides useful information in this regard.B8 This information indicates that total coronary blood flow of about 200 to 250 mL · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (≈120 to 150 mL · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ) is optimal, at least at 30°C. This flow is below 300 mL · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , which under some circumstances produces histologic evidence of myocardial damage,I2 yet is sufficient to prevent undesirable vasoconstriction, which leaves part of the microcirculation without flow or underperfused.

When this method is used, the heart should be kept beating; therefore, the perfusate should be warmer than 30°C. Spanos and colleaguesS22 showed that when ventricular fibrillation persisted throughout the period of coronary perfusion, risk of perioperative infarction and death was higher than if the heart were beating. This would be expected from knowledge of subendocardial blood flow during ventricular fibrillation.B46,H13

## *Hypothermic Fibrillating Heart*

In continuous coronary perfusion with ventricular fibrillation, fibrillation can be maintained by an electrical current, which is necessary when the perfusion is at 37°C, or it may be spontaneously or electrically induced and maintained by moderately hypothermic (25°C-30°C) coronary perfusion. The latter condition is desirable. Coronary perfusion can be through the intact aortic root (as in CABG) or by individual coronary perfusion cannulae during aortic valve replacement.

A number of theoretical objections to the method can be raised. For example, perfusion of the subendocardium is impaired during CPB and ventricular fibrillation, particularly in hearts with ventricular hypertrophy. However, good clinical results have been obtained using either normothermic CPB and electrically maintained ventricular fibrillation or moderate hypothermia and ventricular fibrillation sustained only by hypothermia, or profound cardiac hypothermia and ventricular fibrillation. Akins has reported excellent results from CABG using the latter method.A5,A6 Time constraints must apply to this method, as to most others, but they have not been defined. The surgical conditions that exist with this method are better than with the beating heart, but most surgeons find them less satisfactory than with a cardioplegic technique.

## Moderately Hypothermic Intermittent Global Myocardial Ischemia

Use of intermittent cardiac ischemia with moderate cardiac hypothermia requires conducting CPB with the perfusate temperature at 25°C to 30°C. The surgeon works on or in the heart intermittently for periods of 10 to 15 minutes, during which time the ascending aorta is clamped (to stop coronary perfusion) or individual perfusion into the coronary ostia is interrupted. Between these periods, the aortic clamp is released (or individual coronary perfusion resumed) for 3 to 5 minutes. When the technique is used optimally, the heart is made to beat (not fibrillate) during this interval. This was the method most commonly used during the 1960s and early 1970s, but is used by some surgeons today.

The clinical results can be good, as was demonstrated by McGoon and by Bonchek and colleagues.A16,B24,M11 McGoon's analysis of one group of patients—those receiving valved extracardiac conduits—indicated no relationship between the proportion of nonsurvivors in the experience and cumulative aortic clamp time. However, because 35% of the 468 patients in the group had low cardiac output postoperativelyM11 (in which subset the mortality was 52%), the method must have been producing myocardial damage. Reduto and colleagues found no difference in left ventricular performance early after CABG, regardless of whether this or cold cardioplegic myocardial protection was used.R3

The method does not provide optimal exposure for operations inside the heart, but does provide reasonable working conditions for CABG. Unless the heart is electrically fibrillated just before aortic clamping, it continues to beat during much of the ischemic period, making precise repair difficult. Each time coronary perfusion is recommenced, coronary (and perhaps systemic) air embolization may occur, despite precautions against it. A considerable amount of blood comes into the heart during periods of coronary perfusion, stressing the intracardiac sucker systems and thereby increasing blood damage and interfering with the smooth and efficient flow of the operation. Moreover, each time the coronary arteries are perfused in this uncontrolled manner, a reperfusion injury may occur.

## Profoundly Hypothermic Global Myocardial Ischemia

The heart may be profoundly cooled by the perfusate, by filling the pericardium with very cold saline solution, or by both, after which the aorta is clamped. The cardiac operation is done during a single period of aortic clamping.B39,C16,G9,H14,K17,S10 In clinical practice, myocardial temperature is generally about 22°C with these methodsC17; most surgeons believe that this allows 45 to 60 minutes of safe global myocardial ischemia.

This technique provides better operating conditions than those discussed earlier, and good results have been obtained with it.K10 Despite this important consideration, a randomized study of patients undergoing aortic valve replacement showed that this technique results in as much myocardial necrosis as does continuous individual coronary perfusion.S4

Profoundly hypothermic cardiac ischemia without cardioplegia may be preferred for infant cardiac surgery in which hypothermic circulatory arrest is used. Part of the rationale for this preference is that no perfusate passes through the heart to rewarm or inadequately reperfuse it during circulatory arrest, as may happen when CPB is continued.

#### Drug-Mediated Myocardial Protection

Both β-adrenergic receptor blocking and calcium channel blocking drugs, in conjunction with one of the other methods, have been used as part of the myocardial management by some groups.C12,M1 The calcium channel blocking agents verapamil and diltiazem have seemed particularly advantageous because of their prevention of calcium influx into cells and their coronary vasodilatory effects.B5 However, these drugs are potent negative inotropes and produce prolonged electromechanical quiescence, at least when used clinically in cardioplegic solutions.B7,C10

Particularly good results have been obtained by giving lidoflazine intravenously just before CPB and using moderately hypothermic intermittent cardiac ischemia.F6,K1 Lidoflazine is believed to be a nucleotide transport inhibitor, which results in increased myocardial accumulation of endogenous adenosine during ischemia, increased lactate extraction during reperfusion, and improved postischemic function.C3 The basic action of lidoflazine is complex and appears to be different from that of β-blocking and calcium channel blocking drugs.

Certain drugs have been shown in experimental studies to reduce reperfusion damage related to oxygen-derived free radicals (see Advantageous Conditions during Reperfusion earlier in this chapter). However, when using blood cardioplegia and pressure-controlled, initially hyperkalemic, blood reperfusion, incorporation of free radical scavengers has not been demonstrated to provide additional protection.

## Cold Cardioplegia (Multidose)

The underlying principles of all cardioplegic solutions are listed in Box 3-1. F2 Inducing chemical arrest to conserve energy during the period of myocardial ischemia can be accomplished by two basic mechanismsF2:

- 1. Inhibition of the fast sodium current to prevent conduction of the myocardial action potential by one or more of the following methods:
  - a. Extracellular hyperkalemia
  - b. Sodium channel blockers (e.g., lidocaine)
  - c. KATP channel openers (e.g., adenosine)
- 2. Inhibition of calcium activation of myofilaments to prevent myocyte contraction by one or more of the following methods:
  - a. Zero extracellular calcium
  - b. L-type calcium channel blockers (e.g., magnesium)
  - c. Direct myofilament inhibition with agents such as 2,3 butanedione monoxime (BDM)

## *Cardioplegic Solution*

There are both asanguinous solutions and those that are mixed with blood (at a 2:1 or 4:1 blood-to-solution ratio), and extracellular solutions and intracellular solutions as distinguished by their potassium concentrations (Table 3-1). Some believe that the components of the solution, particularly K<sup>+</sup> concentrations, should be altered according to solution temperature, timing of infusion (initial, maintenance,

and terminal), and presumed energy state of the myocardium. In general, K<sup>+</sup> concentration is lowered for maintenance, and substrates are added for energy-depleted hearts. Delivery can be intermittent (multidose) or continuous; in the latter case the K<sup>+</sup> concentration is lower than for intermittent delivery (Box 3-2).

Hyperkalemic cold sanguinous cardioplegia is advantageousB44,I4 and is preferred, although asanguinous cardioplegia may work equally well. The Buckberg formulation (cold, oxygenated, hyperkalemic blood-crystalloid mixture, with lowered free calcium concentration, added glucose, and added buffering capacity) may be preferable to simple hyperkalemic blood (see Table 3-1). The latter, however, is less costly because it involves only transferring blood perfusate from the CPB oxygenator to a separate reservoir–heat exchanger–pump system, adding sufficient potassium chloride to make it cardioplegic (potassium concentration about 22 mmol · L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ).

## *Technique of Antegrade Infusion*

After CPB is established with the perfusate at 32°C (under which conditions ventricular fibrillation should not develop), an aortic root catheter is inserted through a previously placed purse-string stitch, attached to the cardioplegia line, and de-aired. Optionally, the pressure line of the cannula may be attached to a strain gauge for continuous measurement of aortic root pressure. The aorta is clamped as soon as the aortic root catheter is in place, and in any event before the heart has been cooled sufficiently by the whole-body perfusion that it becomes arrhythmic or develops ventricular fibrillation.

Cold cardioplegic infusion is begun promptly at a flow of 150 mL · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> (based on the data for continuous direct coronary perfusion described earlier in this chapter) for

This formulation is intended for dilution by two or four parts blood (perfusate) to solution.

3 minutes in adults; the average adult is given a dose of about 750 mL. In infants and children with a body surface area of less than 1 m2 , the infusion is given at the same flow rate (150 mL · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> body surface area), but for only 2 minutes. Occasionally the monitored aortic root pressure is less than 30 mmHg, in which case the flow rate, but not the total dose, is increased. However, low aortic root perfusion pressure may be due to aortic regurgitation, hidden by the action of a left ventricular vent; the surgeon must be certain that this is not the situation. In patients with severe ischemic heart disease, the aortic root pressure sometimes rises above 75 mmHg, but the flow should not be reduced.

External cooling of the heart may be established while the cardioplegic infusion is being administered. An isolating pad can be placed between the heart and the left side of the pericardium containing the phrenic nerve. A thin layer of ice slush (or ice-cold saline) is placed over the anterior surface of the heart. Later, whenever the heart will be in a stable position for a time, a thin layer of ice slush can be placed on the surface. The slush is never placed in the pericardial space itself, because left phrenic nerve damage may result. As the slush melts, the fluid is aspirated with the high-vacuum sucker. If it is surgically inconvenient, the slush is omitted.

Neither left nor right ventricle is allowed to become distended at any time. A left ventricular vent (introduced through a right pulmonary vein) is used for some operations, suction through an aortic root catheter for others, and simple needle aspiration of the ventricle across the ventricular septum for others.

Cardioplegic solution is reinfused about every 25 minutes.L19 The initial flow rate is used, and the surgeon must be certain that the aortic valve has closed as the infusion begins. If it has not, a few pinches of the proximal aorta usually accomplish valve closure. Reinfusion is given for 30 to 60 seconds. After the first infusion, the potassium concentration of any subsequently infused cardioplegic solution is reduced to about 10 mmol · L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> .

Should serum potassium levels reach 7 to 8 mEq · L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (a rare occurrence), a bolus injection of 400 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> of glucose (as 50% glucose) and 0.2 unit · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> of soluble insulin may be given after the beginning of myocardial reperfusion. Because the levels of both whole-body intracellular

potassiumP1 and circulating insulinC7 are abnormally low at this point, these maneuvers are physiologically reasonable. Alternatively, the technique of ultrafiltration during CPB (see "Changes during Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Chapter 2) may be used to lower elevated serum potassium levels induced by multidose cardioplegia.

#### *Technique of Retrograde Infusion*

Retrograde infusion of cardioplegic solutions directly into the coronary sinus was suggested by Lillehei and colleagues in 1956.L10 Many have found this technique as effective as antegrade infusion,A20 although the right ventricle (particularly its midportion) and right atrium are less well perfused. When instead retrograde infusion is administered through the right atrium and right ventricle, this problem may be avoided.F1,G10,M15,M16,P3,R7,S25 Retrograde coronary sinus infusion is particularly advantageous in the presence of acutely developing high-grade coronary artery stenoses or obstructions.G11

The surgeon should arrange to deliver either antegrade or retrograde cardioplegia, or both. Either before or after CPB has been established, a purse-string stitch is placed in the right atrial wall, and a small stab wound is made in the middle, through which the retrograde infusion catheter is introduced and under digital control manipulated into the coronary sinus.B43 The catheter is attached to one arm of the cardioplegia infusion line and de-aired. The pressure measuring arm of the catheter is connected to a manometer. Coronary sinus pressure must not be allowed to rise above 50 mmHg during coronary sinus infusion.

Indications for combined antegrade-retrograde or totally retrograde infusion vary among surgeons,B14 in part because no clear advantage of retrograde over antegrade infusion of cardioplegic solutions has been identified in patients undergoing elective operations.F5 However, for aortic valve replacement and during mitral valve operations, reinfusions of cardioplegic solution are often more conveniently given by the retrograde method. The same may be true for many operations performed through the right atrium for congenital heart disease.

A conscious decision to use both the antegrade and retrograde routes of cardioplegia routinely, delivered in either an alternating sequential fashion or simultaneously, has evolved in the practice of some institutions.B45 This method allows rapid electromechanical quiescence, protects against uneven cardioplegic distribution, and may maximize the duration of ischemia while avoiding cardioplegia overdose. The combined approach has also been successful in pediatric patients.D11 Thus, we believe retrograde cardioplegia is better viewed as synergistic and complementary to antegrade cardioplegia rather than as the sole method of myocardial management.B45

Severe obstructive manifestations of coronary artery disease are perhaps the best example for the superiority of retrograde cardioplegia. These include left main lesions and acute coronary syndromes.

Various procedures on the aortic valve and the ascending aorta demanding long clamp times are safely accomplished using coronary ostial infusion supplemented by retrograde infusion. These include acute aortic dissections and the Ross procedure.

Retrograde cardioplegic myocardial protection has some disadvantages. It clearly has various degrees of maldistribution to the right ventricle.A10,A21,W3 There is the odd occasion when a left superior vena cava is encountered and is unrecognized. Infrequently, the retrograde cannula cannot be placed or is dislodged. There may be less satisfactory protection in hearts with severe left ventricular hypertrophy. Application may be difficult in children and sometimes impossible in neonates. Coronary sinus rupture is a well-known complication (it can be dealt with before separation from CPB by closure of the rupture with fine suture or oversewing the sinus at the site of rupture). Finally, retrograde cardioplegia demands more cannulae, and in some situations seems to clutter the field in greater measure than its benefit.

#### *Results of Cold Cardioplegia*

Despite several randomized trials and numerous observational studies, the quantitative advantage of the cold cardioplegic technique over other methods of myocardial management in low-risk patients is not unequivocally defined. This alone suggests that it may be small in routine operations performed with reasonable dispatch. The technique facilitates the cardiac operation, and it is the technique most widely used today.

Even with cold cardioplegia, the safe duration of global myocardial ischemic time is not unlimited. Furthermore, it varies according to preoperative ventricular hypertrophy, ventricular function, and energy charge of the myocardium. In general, it is probably about 100 minutes with this particular technique and without controlled reperfusion.

Antegrade cardioplegia has proved safe and effective over many years and in many clinical settings. It is easily accomplished and requires little special equipment. However, myocardial protection in some situations is imperfect using classic antegrade cardioplegia, and thus outcomes may be improved with retrograde cardioplegia delivery.

Retrograde delivery may be superior or synergistic in redo CABG, particularly in the presence of narrowed or obstructed saphenous vein grafts or with an open left internal thoracic artery to an obstructed left anterior descending coronary artery. When CABG is planned in the presence of mild aortic regurgitation (valve not replaced), retrograde cardioplegia is optimal for induction and maintenance. This is also true for other procedures with mild aortic regurgitation in which the aorta need not be opened for direct infusion.

## Single-Dose Cold Cardioplegia in Neonates and Infants

An opinion has been expressed elsewhere in this chapter that (1) no compelling evidence exists that a different method of myocardial management is required in neonates and infants than in older patients, even though some of the characteristics of the heart in these small patients are different from those in older patients, and (2) the optimal method of myocardial management in general remains arguable.

A method that has given excellent results in neonates and infants is single-dose, oxygenated St. Thomas solution (see Table 3-1). Using a simple pressure bag, it is infused into the aortic root proximal to the aortic clamp. The dose is 20 mL · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and is not repeated.

An exception is the first stage of the hypoplastic left heart operation (Norwood operation). The ascending aorta is thin and small in this situation. Simple cold ischemic arrest may be used, primarily because this avoids inserting a needle into the delicate ascending aorta. However, because of the critical importance of right (single) ventricular function in this and other operations for single ventricle, many neonatal cardiac surgeons use single-dose cardioplegia administered through a fine catheter or other techniques (see Chapter 49).

The del Nido pediatric cardioplegic solution is discussed later under "Neonates and Infants" under Special Situations and Controversies.

#### Continuous Cardioplegia

## *Cold Perfusion*

Continuous antegrade cold blood cardioplegia has been used as an alternative to single-dose and multidose intermittent cold cardioplegia. Khuri and colleagues have reported data from measurement of myocardial pH indicating that, at least in hypertrophied hearts, the myocardial milieu is more normal, although not completely normal, with this method than with intermittent cold cardioplegia.K4 Clinical experiences suggest that retrograde continuous cold cardioplegic perfusion through the coronary sinus also provides an excellent method of myocardial management during cardiac surgery.B23,M17,R1 Some have used this method after giving an initial antegrade dose of cold cardioplegia. Under experimental conditions, cold retrograde blood cardioplegia after initial antegrade cold blood cardioplegia has been found to maintain optimal myocardial pH.J15

## *Warm Perfusion*

Continuous warm blood cardioplegia, administered by antegrade infusion or by retrograde coronary sinus infusion after an initial antegrade dose, has also been used for CABG and other cardiac operations.L7,S2,S3 Some groups have found recovery of ventricular function better with use of warm continuous blood cardioplegia than with intermittent cold cardioplegia.Y2 Others have found similar efficacy between warm and cold.M7 Although continuous warm blood cardioplegia provides good protection of the myocardium, it is surgically inconvenient for certain operations.

## Cold Cardioplegia, Controlled Aortic Root Reperfusion, and (When Needed) Warm Cardioplegic Induction

In the belief that control of all aspects of the reperfusion may be even more important than details of cold cardioplegia, and that acutely ill patients coming to the operating room require a special form of myocardial management, the technique described in this section may be used. During reperfusion the heart is separated from the ongoing events in the remainder of the body for a brief time. The technique is surgically convenient, prolongs the operation only mildly, is essentially devoid of ventricular fibrillation, minimizes myocardial stunning and myocardial necrosis, and appears to result in better postoperative cardiac performance than methods previously used.F9,K9 Yet the proof of its advantages has remained as difficult to obtain as for other techniques, which probably accounts for the fact that it is not, as yet, widely used in its entirety.

Some may wish to use simpler methods for routine operations and to restrict the use of this method for more complex high-risk operations. The problems with such a plan are the usual operational disadvantages of a surgical method that is 4

used infrequently rather than routinely (see "Human Error" in Chapter 6), and the fact that even routine operations have a small mortality and occasionally considerable morbidity, which may be nearly eliminated by more perfect myocardial management.

## *Circuitry*

A small, separate system on the pump-oxygenator, with its own miniaturized heat exchanger3 and two pumps, manages aortic root infusions, retrograde infusions, or both. It enables the solution of choice to be infused at controlled temperature and pressure. Although the circuitry seems complex, from the surgeon's standpoint its use is simple and extremely flexible. Perfusionists have demonstrated their ability to manage it both effectively and efficiently.

## *Technique for Elective Surgery*

After the operation is completed, using cardioplegic myocardial management and with the aortic clamp still in place, controlled aortic root reperfusion is begun, initially using warm, hyperkalemic, modified, and enriched blood cardioplegia. The aortic root pressure is kept at 30 mmHg for the first 60 to 120 seconds of the reperfusion, for the reasons discussed earlier. The flow is then increased until the aortic root pressure is 50 to 75 mmHg in adults (or to the normal systemic arterial diastolic pressure in infants and children whose body surface area is <1 m2 ). A total of 500 mL of the modified blood reperfusate is administered. For patients with a body surface area of less than 1.5 m2 , the reperfusate volume = 500 × BSA ÷ 1.5. Once that has been infused, the perfusionist continues the controlled aortic root reperfusion by arranging the circuit so aortic root perfusion continues with normothermic, normokalemic, unmodified blood.

During the controlled aortic root reperfusion, the surgeon must concentrate on avoiding ventricular distention, the adverse effects of which have been fully documented.A9,B41 The heart remains flaccid and electromechanically quiescent for 2 to 10 minutes after the onset of the controlled aortic root reperfusion. During this time, the coronary resistance may rise, requiring the perfusionist to reduce the flow rate to maintain a constant aortic root pressure. Should that occur, boluses of 5 mL of nitroglycerin4 may be administered into the line by the surgeon, although the value of this is uncertain.

When the period of quiescence passes and cardiac action begins, the initial rhythm frequently is AV dissociation. Very rarely, it is ventricular fibrillation.F9 The controlled aortic root perfusion continues. Small-volume pulmonary ventilation is begun, because the right ventricle pumps some blood through the lungs. Even the vented left ventricle will eject some blood into the isolated aortic root. The perfusionist must be alert to the need to reduce the aortic root perfusion flow rate to keep the aortic root pressure from becoming excessively high (>120 mmHg). At times, the perfusionist may need to place suction on the aortic root pressure catheter to prevent this problem. Controlled aortic root perfusion is continued until sinus rhythm has returned and ventricular contractions are strong. The interval between the beginning of the controlled aortic root reperfusion and the reaching of these end points

One milligram of nitroglycerin in 5 mL of a balanced salt solution. Bentley (surface, stainless steel; priming volume, 120 mL; efficiency 0.8) or Shiley (surface, anodized aluminium; priming volume, 150 mL; efficiency 0.6).

is usually 10 to 25 minutes. When the end points cannot be reached, myocardial management was in some way imperfect, and the patient almost certainly will require pharmacologic or mechanical support after CPB.

When the end points are reached, the perfusionist places strong suction (rather than perfusion) on the aortic root catheter and partly occludes the venous line so that some blood passes into the right ventricle and through the lungs; the anesthesiologist intermittently inflates the lung to assist in moving any air that is present out of the pulmonary veins and left atrium into the left ventricle, which ejects it into the aortic root. The suction on the aortic root catheter evacuates any mobilized boluses of air as the surgeon ballots the left atrium and pulmonary veins. These procedures are repeated several times. Although strong suction continues on the aortic root catheter, the aortic clamp is released. As the clamp is released, the patient's blood volume is rapidly augmented to bring left atrial or pulmonary artery wedge pressure to 6 to 10 mmHg so that the heart's ejection will continue to maintain a good systemic arterial pressure and a good coronary perfusion pressure. Thereafter, the usual detailed de-airing procedure is followed (see "De-Airing the Heart" in Section III of Chapter 2). CPB is then discontinued; usually nothing remains but to establish hemostasis and close the chest.

#### *Technique for Energy-Depleted Hearts*

Patients who come to operation in acute cardiac failure with hemodynamic instability or are severely cyanotic have energydepleted hearts. Specific efforts to improve the energy charge of the heart before submitting it to the period of global myocardial ischemia probably result in better cardiac structure and function postoperatively.R23,R25 Survival should thereby be enhanced.

After making the median sternotomy, CPB at 35°C is established as expeditiously as possible. The aortic root catheter is inserted. The aorta is clamped, and warm hyperkalemic, modified and enriched blood infusion is begun. The infusion is given at the usual flow rate for induction of cardioplegia and continued for 5 minutes. The perfusionist then makes the cardioplegic solution as cold as possible while the aortic root infusion of the same cardioplegic solution continues for another 3 minutes.

Subsequent cold infusions are given every 20 to 30 minutes as usual, except with a potassium concentration of about 10 mmol · L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . After completing the cardiac procedure, warm reperfusion is performed in the standard manner. (See Special Situations and Controversies in this chapter for details on myocardial management when an acute coronary occlusion immediately precedes the operation.)

## ANCILLARY MEASURES FOR PREVENTING MYOCARDIAL DAMAGE

Important myocardial necrosis can develop between induction of anesthesia and start of CPB in as many as 30% to 40% of patients undergoing CABG when anesthetic and supportive management is suboptimal (Roe CR: unpublished data, 1976). Lell and colleagues have shown that this proportion can fall to almost 3% under optimal circumstances.L6 No doubt patients other than those undergoing CABG are also at risk of developing myocardial damage during this period, particularly those with marked ventricular hypertrophy or reduced myocardial energy charge. Proper intraoperative management before and after CPB avoids increased myocardial oxygen demand (which can be caused by arterial hypertension, tachycardia, and increased endogenous catecholamine secretion from anxiety and excitement). It avoids high ventricular end-diastolic pressures and the concomitant detrimental effect on perfusion of the subendocardium.H11 Good management maintains an optimal myocardial oxygen supply by maintaining adequate arterial oxygen levels and arterial blood pressure and adjusts ventricular preload and afterload to achieve a reasonable compromise between adequacy of cardiac output and avoidance of deleterious effects (see Chapter 4 for details).

Important perioperative myocardial necrosis can develop because of events occurring after CPB, either before or after the patient leaves the operating room. These may be events that produce imbalances between myocardial oxygen demand and supply. Use of catecholamines for treating low cardiac output early after CPB can result in myocardial necrosis.H1,M21

## SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

## Species and Model Differences

Possible species and experimental model differences pose a major problem in generating inferences regarding myocardial management during cardiac surgery in human subjects. For example, extensive myocardial edema is frequently observed after ischemia and reperfusion in experimental studies of many different types in many different animal models.R19 Yet in clinical experience it has been rarely evident, except for instances of prolonged and severe damage and of some operations in young patients. In support of this, a careful study in humans using two-dimensional echocardiography failed to disclose any increase in left ventricular mass (a reasonably sensitive indicator of increased myocardial water) after uncomplicated cardiac operations in which cardioplegia was used.S23 By contrast, the same study in a dog model showed a marked sudden increase in left ventricular mass.

Inferences from studies in isolated supported heart models, usually rat heart, are generally transferred to human cardiac surgery with some difficulty. This difficulty is considerably increased when the isolated heart models are perfused with a crystalloid solution, because such models behave differently from blood-perfused models.W1

Inferences from studies of immature hearts in animal models are transferred with difficulty to cardiac surgery in neonates and infants, because the relationship of age-defined cardiac immaturity in one species to that in another is uncertain.

These considerations emphasize that confirmation of the applicability to humans of inferences derived from animal models must continually be sought.

#### Neonates and Infants

Certain cardiac events begin at birth and change the characteristics of the neonatal heart into those of a mature heart. The time frame of many of these events is not known. As a result, the rather noncompliant neonatal heartR17 gradually becomes more compliant and proceeds from having little functional reserveT6,T8 to having that of the mature heart. Coronary reserve may be greater in immature hearts.T11

In general, the normal neonatal and infant heart is believed to be more resistant to ischemic and reperfusion damage than is the normal adult heart, even when both are protected by hypothermia during the ischemic period.B27,G8 This greater resistance is not necessarily present in hearts of cyanotic neonates and children or those in acute or chronic heart failure.

#### *Ischemic Damage*

The cell membrane (sarcolemma) of myocytes from immature hearts is generally believed to be more resistant to the calcium paradox and other forms of calcium damage than that of myocytes from mature hearts.C8 Related to this is the finding that the sarcolemma of immature hearts binds calcium more effectively than that of mature hearts.B26 All this points to greater stability of the sarcolemma of immature hearts and tighter glycocalyceal junction, and consequently to greater resistance to the intracellular influx of calcium during and after ischemia.N2 (However, some data suggest less membrane stability and less resistance to calcium influx in the *newborn,* in contrast to the *neonatal,* heart.P7) By contrast, immature hearts do not have as good a capacity to sequester (immobilize) intracellular calcium as do mature hearts,S11 making them more vulnerable to damage once calcium has entered the cells.F11

The adult myocardium normally relies primarily on fatty acids to produce energy for myocardial contraction and cell survival. This is also true in the neonatal heart; in contrast to the adult heart, the neonatal heart has relatively large glycogen stores and thus a relatively large capacity for anaerobic glycolysis. This feature begins to disappear shortly after birthH10 and has disappeared completely by about 2 months of age. ATP utilization appears to be slower in immature hearts because of lower contractile energy requirements.A1 These mechanisms and perhaps others probably provide to both neonatal and immature but otherwise normal infant hearts a higher tolerance to ischemia than that possessed by adult hearts.B28,G8,J14,N9,S10,Y4

Larger stores of amino acids in neonatal hearts also contribute to their increased capacity for anaerobic metabolism, including ATP production, and this persists throughout infancy. This anaerobic ATP production appears to be for the transamination and substrate level phosphorylation of glutamate and pyruvate.J10 This may be expected to result in better maintenance of cellular integrity during ischemia and thereby better functional recovery after ischemia than experienced by adult hearts. These considerations also help explain the demonstrated value of amino acid supplementation for improving tolerance of the immature heart to ischemia and hypoxia.J13,M9 However, some have found the immature myocardium (less than about 18 months old) to be deficient in cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase and thereby less able than mature myocardium to convert cyclic AMP and inosine back to ATP.L14

#### *Reperfusion Damage*

Complement activation and leukocyte infiltration play as important a role in reperfusion injury in immature hearts as they do in mature hearts.B34 Other than this, little is known about possible differences in susceptibility of immature hearts to reperfusion (as compared with ischemic) injury, compared with mature hearts.

#### *Abnormal Immature Hearts*

These characteristics of normal neonatal and infant myocardium may or may not be characteristic of abnormal neonatal or infant hearts. Neonates and infants who come to cardiac surgery are unlikely to have normal myocardium, because they are usually either cyanotic or in heart failure, or both. Julia and colleagues have shown that immature hearts in acute cardiac failure or recently subjected to hypoxia develop profound functional depression after periods of ischemia well tolerated by normal immature hearts.J11 Thus, neonates and infants who come to open heart surgery probably have hearts that are *not* unusually resistant to the damaging effects of global myocardial ischemia. Cyanosis, both acute and chronic, accelerates these damaging effects and lessens postischemic recovery, probably as a result of its effect on myocardial metabolism.F14,L21,V9

BuckbergB40 has demonstrated experimentally that cyanotic neonates and infants may suffer myocardial injury simply by exposure to reoxygenation during CPB, particularly the initial stages of CPB. This hypoxemic/reoxygenation injury may be avoidable by beginning CPB at the ambient oxygen tension of the hypoxemic subject. Reoxygenation injury is linked to oxidant damage and a lack of antioxidant reserve capacity in cyanotic immature myocardium. Reoxygenation is associated with elevation of conjugated dienes, generation of hydroxyl radicals causing lipid peroxidation, and release of nitric oxide. Buckberg's studies further suggest that adding desferrioxamine and antioxidants (*N*-[2-mereoptoproprionyl] glycine, catalase, and coenzyme Q10) to the CPB prime might limit in vivo oxidant damage and improve myocardial functional reserve. The importance of these observations made in animal preparations has yet to be clarified in human neonatal myocardial management.

#### *Methods of Myocardial Management*

The effectiveness of cold cardioplegia in the immature heart is arguable. A paper by Bull and colleagues is often cited in the introduction to experimental papers on the subject, in support of the idea that cold cardioplegia as used in adults is not effective in young patients.B48 However, these investigators found the "safe" ischemic time to be 65 minutes when intermittent aortic clamping was used and 85 minutes when cold cardioplegia was used.B48 Another early experience found cold crystalloid cardioplegia advantageous in neonates and infants,K7 as did Schachner and colleagues in a small randomized trial.S6

From experimental models, many different and sometimes conflicting inferences have been derived. In one experimental study, cold cardioplegia was found to reduce ischemic injury in immature hearts.A23 Multidose administration of cardioplegic solutions was shown to be disadvantageous in immature hearts.K3 Various crystalloid solutions have been found experimentally to be superior to others for use in immature hearts. At least one study detected superior myocardial protection in infants and young children with cardiac surgery using cold blood cardioplegia rather than crystalloid St. Thomas solution.A12 Other experimental studies have shown that including glutamate and aspartate in the warm induction of cardioplegia and in the reperfusate provides additional benefit.F14,J14,K15

One point of view, compatible with all available evidence but not with the opinions of some, is that the basic methodology for myocardial management in neonates, infants, and

From del Nido and colleagues.D4

children should be similar to that in adults. Little concerted effort has been made to overcome the technical difficulty of accomplishing this in very small hearts. For example, in many operations in neonates, the procedure is done largely through the right atrium; retrograde infusion of the sanguinous cardioplegic solution into the coronary sinus should be particularly convenient. In fact, the feasibility, safety, and efficiency of retrograde coronary sinus infusion of blood cardioplegic solution as maintenance cardioplegia has been demonstrated in the arterial switch operationY3 and in complex arch reconstruction.G3

Despite the general point of view expressed earlier (that the methodology of myocardial management in infants should be similar to that in older and larger patients), there is considerable interest in and increasing experience with a cardioplegic solution that has a focused application in neonates, infants, and children. The del Nido cardioplegic solution (Table 3-2) D4 has undergone several modifications at various pediatric centersO1 but contains the basic extracellular composition used in the Buckberg solutions, with the following major differences:

- Calcium concentration is lower to address the evidence that pediatric myocardium relies more on calcium flux for excitation-contraction and is less tolerant of postischemic calcium overload.
- Magnesium is increased to further depress cell excitability (and therefore cellular metabolism and ATP utilization) during the ischemic period.

■ Lidocaine is added to block sodium channels; this reduces cell excitability and limits calcium overload during early reperfusion.H2,P6,V3

The del Nido cardioplegic solution (Baxter) is combined with blood in a ratio of four parts solution to one part blood. The accumulated clinical experience with del Nido solution in neonates, infants, and children has been very favorable, with most surgeons noting more rapid return of sinus rhythm and excellent cardiac function despite longer recommended periods between cardioplegia administration (30-45 minutes vs. 20-30 minutes) compared with Buckberg cardioplegia.

When using the technique of cold cardioplegia, controlled aortic root reperfusion, and (when needed) warm cardioplegic induction, all catheters, cannulae, doses, flow rates, and pressures should be scaled appropriately to small patients, as has been described.

## Aortic Valve Surgery

When aortic regurgitation is mild in patients requiring aortic valve replacement or other operations, the initial cardioplegic infusion may be administered antegradely in the usual way through the unopened aortic root or retrogradely via the previously placed coronary sinus cannula. If the aortic root infusion maintains an adequate pressure in the aortic root, and thus confirms that runoff is minimal, the left atrial vent line is clamped, the infusion continued, and the left ventricle gently massaged manually during the infusion period. This prevents left ventricular distention and assists in perfusing the coronary arteries. If runoff is excessive, an aortotomy is made and the cold cardioplegic infusion is given directly into the coronary ostia (see "Perfusion of Individual Coronary Arteries" earlier in this chapter).

Unless the aortic valve is completely competent, which is uncommon, induction of cold cardioplegia for aortic valve repair or replacement is best accomplished by direct infusion of the solution into the coronary ostia, preceded by retrograde induction via the coronary sinus. The apparently complex sequence about to be described is unnecessary for cardioplegia with the capability for retrograde delivery, but is needed until retrograde *reperfusion* is established as a useful modality.

The circuit is modified at the operating table in such cases by placing a Y connector in the antegrade cardioplegia tubing, one distal arm of which connects to the aortic root infusion catheter and the other to a second Y, to each arm of which an O-ring direct coronary perfusion cannula is connected. A clamp is placed just beyond the first Y on the tubing leading to the second Y and the direct coronary perfusion cannulae. After CPB has been established and the aortic root catheter has been inserted, properly connected, de-aired, and the line leading to it clamped and the line to the second Y unclamped, the aorta is clamped, and the aortic root is opened transversely but not completely. One of the O-ring cannulae is inserted into the left coronary ostium and about three fifths of the initial cardioplegic infusion given. A second O-ring cannula is similarly placed in the right coronary ostium and the remaining two fifths of the cardioplegic infusion given. Ideally, and when easily accomplished, both infusions are given simultaneously. A 5-0 or 6-0 polypropylene suture is placed around each of the cannulae, brought out of the adjacent aortic wall, and secured with a "snugger." Subsequent cardioplegic infusions may be given in this manner or retrogradely via the coronary sinus (see "Technique of Retrograde Infusion" earlier in this chapter).

A major reason for preferring this arrangement for the induction and maintenance of cardioplegia lies in the reperfusion phase. All devices for aortic valve replacement, except the allograft, autograft, and stentless xenograft valve inserted free hand or as an aortic root replacement, leak a variable but usually considerable amount of blood from the aortic root back through the sewing ring, at least, into the left ventricle. The left ventricular vent can keep the ventricle decompressed, but maintaining desired aortic root pressure frequently becomes impossible during reperfusion via the aortic root. Therefore, the usually warm and initially hyperkalemic modified blood reperfusion after aortic valve surgery is infused through the direct coronary perfusion cannulae. Many surgeons use simultaneous retrograde coronary sinus infusion as an adjunct to this reperfusion phase, beginning with substrate-enhanced hyperkalemic blood, then switching to normothermic normokalemic blood. While this is proceeding, closure of the aortotomy begins. The left ventricular vent keeps the operative field dry even after cardiac action begins. The last few sutures of the aortotomy closure are placed but left loose.

When the heart is beating well and the criteria previously described for ceasing the controlled aortic root reperfusion are met, suction on the left ventricular vent is reduced to a low level or stopped. If necessary, the venous tubing is occluded briefly to drive a little blood through the lungs and back into the left ventricle. Blood ejected by the left ventricle now essentially fills the aortic root and escapes through the loose part of the suture line. An assistant clamps the tubing leading to the Y connector with its direct coronary perfusion cannulae and unclamps the line to the aortic root catheter, the perfusionist places mild suction on the aortic root catheter, and the surgeon removes the "snuggers" on the sutures around the coronary cannulae; the sutures and then the cannulae are removed, and the aortotomy sutures are snugged and tied. Because the heart is beating well, aortic root pressure (being monitored by the aortic root cannula as usual) may tend to rise, but the perfusionist controls this by increasing suction on the aortic root pressure monitoring catheter as needed. The aortic clamp is still in place, so systemic air embolization is not possible.

By slightly occluding the venous line, the perfusionist causes the left ventricle to receive sufficient blood so that its ejection maintains an aortic root pressure of about 100 mmHg systolic. Suction continues on the aortic root catheter with minimal or no suction on the left ventricular vent, and usual de-airing procedures are accomplished (see Chapter 2). The aortic clamp is then removed, and the entire de-airing procedure is repeated. The remainder of the operation proceeds in the usual manner.

## Coexisting Mild Aortic Regurgitation

Some cardiac operations are complicated by the presence of aortic regurgitation, too mild to justify aortic valve replacement (or repair) but sufficient to complicate myocardial management. If an appropriate aortic root pressure can be maintained during induction of cold cardioplegia and reperfusion, standard aortic root infusions are used.

If the regurgitation is such that an appropriate aortic root pressure *cannot* be achieved during administration of the cold cardioplegic solution or during reperfusion, cold cardioplegic solution is administered retrogradely through the coronary sinus. In the reperfusion phase, the heart can be carried through the initially warm hyperkalemic reperfusion and then the normokalemic reperfusion until cardiac action fully resumes, using exclusively retrograde perfusion through the coronary sinus.

Alternatively, the aortic valve can be made surgically competent for subsequent multidose aortic root cardioplegia administration. With or without an initial antegrade cardioplegia dose into each coronary ostium, a 5-0 or 6-0 polypropylene suture is placed through the midpoint of each cusp's free edge (Frater stitch). The suture is pulled up to verify good leaflet apposition, after which the aortotomy is closed, bringing the polypropylene valve suture out through the suture line. With a now competent aortic valve, subsequent doses of cardioplegia can be administered through the aortic root. During reperfusion, the polypropylene suture is removed when cardiac contraction resumes.

## Acute Occlusion of the Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery

Patients brought to the operating room shortly after acute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) are usually hemodynamically unstable or in cardiogenic shock. Because of both the acute occlusion and the hemodynamic state, these patients present a special challenge. The principles set down and tested by Allen and Buckberg and colleagues form the basis for the management program described here.A8 These principles include:

- Initial controlled administration of warm cardioplegic solution (see "Cold Cardioplegia, Controlled Aortic Root Reperfusion, and [When Needed] Warm Cardioplegic Induction" earlier in this chapter), administered antegradely for 2.5 minutes and retrogradely (through the coronary sinus) for 2.5 minutes
- Use of at least a vein graft to the LAD (or another coronary vessel if it is responsible for the acute infarction)
- Prolonged (20 minutes) controlled reperfusion with hyperkalemic modified blood of the LAD (or another coronary artery if it was the culprit responsible for the area of acute ischemia)

The general plan of the operation is as described under Technique of Operation in Chapter 7. Initial warm cardioplegia (administered as just described) followed by usual cold cardioplegia produces cardiac quiescence. During the grafting procedure, it is supplemented in the usual manner by additional intermittent infusions of the cold cardioplegic solutions. Antegrade and retrograde routes of infusion are used alternately, or as dictated by ease of delivery, or by number of grafts in place.

#### Large Noncoronary Collateral Flow

Occasionally in patients with long-standing severe coronary artery disease, noncoronary collateral blood flow may be large and, under the usual circumstances of the coronary operation, can actually restart cardiac electromechanical activity by washing out the cardioplegic solution, despite cardiac venting and multidose cardioplegia. Clinical experience indicates that under these circumstances, risk of important myocardial damage is increased. Therefore, at the first sign of this development, the whole-body perfusate temperature is made as cold as possible until the patient's temperature reaches 20°C; the perfusate temperature is then set at 20°C and CPB flow reduced to about 1 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> . Another dose of cold cardioplegia is then administered.

## Active Rheumatic Pericarditis Necessitating Multiple Valve Surgery

Patients with active rheumatic pericarditis necessitating multiple valve surgery present special problems because of their extensive and vascular pericardial adhesions. If divided, these adhesions cause excessive bleeding and contribute an excessive collateral coronary flow. Such patients are critically ill, usually with aortic and mitral regurgitation. If cold cardioplegia is used, low-flow hypothermic perfusion and repeated cardioplegic infusions are necessary.

#### Reoperative Surgery

Reoperative CABG also may present special issues for myocardial management. In general, cardioplegic myocardial protection should be established early in the procedure—usually before mobilization of the cardiac mass. Antegrade and retrograde infusions are complementary; it is thus imperative that the retrograde catheter be placed accurately in the coronary sinus. This can be accomplished by minimal sharp dissection over the acute margin of the right ventricle followed by accurate posterior freeing dissection. In most cases, a patent internal thoracic artery graft should be identified by careful dissection, partially mobilized, and occluded during the cardioplegic period. Alternatively, it can be left open and CPB conducted at 20°C to 25°C with frequent cardioplegia administration and intermittent fibrillation.

Whether patent vein grafts should remain in situ is controversial; however, for induction of cardioplegia, aortic root antegrade infusion along with retrograde infusion with saphenous veins grafts left in place seems the surest way to obtain close to optimal delivery of cardioplegic solution.

Because of adhesions, the myocardium tends to rewarm more quickly than usual. More frequent cardioplegia infusion, low systemic perfusion temperature, or both are appropriate.
