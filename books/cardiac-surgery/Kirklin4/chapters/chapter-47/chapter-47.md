Congenital aortic stenosis is a cardiac anomaly in which narrowing at valvar, subvalvar, supravalvar, or combined (multiple) levels results in a systolic pressure gradient between the inflow portion of the left ventricle (LV) and the aorta beyond the obstruction. A spectrum of defects involves the aortic root, with some overlap of abnormalities. Congenital aortic stenosis in neonates and infants may be part of the constellation of hypoplastic left heart physiology (see "Coarctation as Part of Hypoplastic Left Heart Physiology" under Morphology in Section I of Chapter 48). This association is highly relevant to therapy.

# **Section I Congenital Valvar Aortic Stenosis**

## DEFINITION

Congenital valvar aortic stenosis includes defects in which the major malformation involves the aortic valve cusps. An obstruction at valve level is caused by imperfect cusp development with cusp thickening and fusion. Cusp abnormalities can be severe in early life; when they are not, important obstruction may not develop until later in life when calcification occurs.R10 This chapter discusses congenital valvar aortic stenosis only in the age range from birth to young adult life.

## HISTORICAL NOTE

Congenital valvar aortic stenosis has been long recognized by morphologists. Initial efforts to find a surgical solution were made by Carrel and Jeger, who independently attempted experimentally to place conduits between left ventricular apex and aorta.C3,J3 In 1955, Marquis and Logan reported surgical treatment using dilators introduced through the LV apex, as did Downing in 1956.D15,M4 Also in 1956, valvotomy was performed by an open technique during inflow stasis with moderate hypothermia induced by surface cooling.L11,S31,S32 The first report of its treatment by accurate valvotomy during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was by Spencer and colleagues in 1958,S17 although this had been performed at the Mayo Clinic in 1956 and was reported by Ellis and Kirklin in 1962.E4,E5

## MORPHOLOGY

#### Aortic Valve

The prevalences and precise nature of the various types of morphology of severely stenotic aortic valves and coexisting anomalies are incompletely understood for several reasons. First, it is difficult to obtain enough cases to constitute a reasonable sample of the spectrum of severe congenital valvar stenosis in neonates, infants, and children. Second, sources of data range from autopsy studies and surgical studies to echocardiographic and cineangiographic imaging in patients undergoing balloon valvotomy. Third, differing terminology contributes to incompleteness of morphologic data; ideally, not only should the morphologic nature of the cusps be defined, but also that of the sinuses of Valsalva, commissures (upper points of attachment of cusps to the aortic wall), and interleaflet triangles (fibrous or muscular tissue interposed between the sinuses in the subcusp LV outflow tract), as described by Angelini and colleagues for bicuspid valves.A3

In patients with stenosis severe enough to require operation in infancy or childhood, the valve is *bicuspid* in about 65% (Table 47-1). The valve usually consists of thickened

right and left cusps in association with anterior and posterior commissures and a slitlike orifice with its long axis in the sagittal plane (Fig. 47-1, *A*). The left cusp is frequently the larger and may contain a transversely placed central thickened ridge, or buttress, representing a rudimentary commissure between normal right and left cusps. Less often, the two cusps are anterior and posterior, and the orifice is then oriented in a coronal plane. There is usually fusion peripherally of one commissure and occasionally of both. However, severe

stenosis can occur without fusion, resulting only from thickened cusps and a bicuspid configuration. If free edges of both thickened cusps are taut, they are then equal in length to the diameter of the aortic root and cannot open (Fig. 47-1, *B*).E1 Most bicuspid valves will show three intercusp triangles on their ventricular side, indicating that three cusps were present in the developing valve.M1 A bicuspid valve with only two definitive cusps is uncommon and usually is not stenotic early in life, rather presenting later in life with obstruction or regurgitation. A full discussion of the genetics, morphology, natural history, and therapeutic options for adult patients with a congenitally bicuspid aortic valve is found in Chapter 12*.*

In about 30% of patients the valve is *tricuspid,* with three thickened cusps of approximately equal size and three recognizable commissures that are fused peripherally to varying degrees, creating a dome with a central stenotic orifice. This type of valve is more favorable for valvotomy because all three commissures can usually be opened.

Less often (5%) the valve may have a *unicuspid* configuration with only one commissure (Fig. 47-2). This variety is more common in infants presenting with severe stenosis.M26 Occasionally, however, the stenosis is not severe, and signs and symptoms develop in later life as the valve thickens and calcifies.F1 A thickened unicuspid valve is inherently stenotic, whether the commissure is fused or not, unless the cusp is particularly redundant.

The cusps are approximately equal in size in only a small percentage of congenitally bicuspid or stenotic tricuspid valves.A3 Likewise, the raphae are variable in thickness and length. Number of sinuses may not be the same as number of cusps; most congenitally bicuspid and unicuspid *(unicommissural)* valves have three sinuses and three intercusp triangles.A3,M1

Diffuse cusp thickening, most marked at the free cusp edges, contributes importantly to valvar stenosis. Thickening is more extreme in symptomatic neonates and infants, and cusps may be irregular and myxomatous or dysplastic in

appearance.C7 In addition, particularly in infants, the aortic "anulus" may be small and stenotic, especially with unicuspid valves,F12 and frequently in association with other components of hypoplastic left heart physiology such as endocardial fibroelastosis of a hypoplastic left ventricle (Fig. 47-3), coarctation of the aorta, patent ductus arteriosus, and mitral regurgitation or stenosis.H5,L2

## Left Ventricle

The LV is always concentrically hypertrophied in children with severe aortic stenosis, but in infants hypertrophy may be extreme, with a tiny cavity and extensive fibrosis in the wall (Fig. 47-4). Fibrosis is primarily in the subendocardial region.C10 Extensive endocardial fibroelastosis may also be present, possibly the result of ischemia of subendocardial layers. In these hearts, the ventricle may be dilated (Fig. 47-5).

## Coexisting Cardiac Anomalies

Congenital valvar aortic stenosis may be associated with a fibrous subvalvar or supravalvar stenosis, as well as with coarctation of the aorta.H5

The various coexisting components of hypoplastic left heart physiology include LV hypoplasia of varying degrees, extreme LV hypertrophy with small cavity size, endocardial fibroelastosis, congenital mitral stenosis or regurgitation, severe coarctation, and subaortic stenosis caused by mitral valve abnormalities (Table 47-2). Patent ductus arteriosus or ventricular septal defect (VSD) as well as pulmonary atresia may also be present.

## CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

#### Symptoms

Neonates and infants with severe valvar aortic stenosis usually present with pallor, perspiration, and inability to feed.

Opened left ventricle *(LV)* is small and has extreme hypertrophy and moderate endocardial fibroelastosis that also involves the papillary muscles of the mitral valve *(MV)*.

**Figure 47-5** Specimen of congenital aortic stenosis from 12-dayold infant. Opened left ventricle *(LV)* is hypertrophied and dilated. Smooth septal surface is due to endocardial fibroelastosis that measures 1.5 mm in thickness. There is associated congenital mitral valve *(MV)* disease, with thickened leaflets and chordae and obliteration of interchordal spaces (see Morphology in Chapter 50).

Shortness of breath and cyanosis may be present. In children and young adults, even important stenosis may be without symptoms. However, effort dyspnea, effort angina, or effort syncope, singly or in combination, usually indicates a severe lesion.D16,G10,H13 Dyspnea may be present with moderate stenosis.

#### Signs

In neonates and infants with severe valvar aortic stenosis, the most striking feature is small pulse volume with pallor, dyspnea, and at times cyanosis. Both the murmur and gradient across the valve may be unimpressive because of a low cardiac output. There also may be a hyperactive right ventricular impulse.

Clinical signs in children and young adults include an ejection systolic murmur (and thrill) at the base radiating to the carotid vessels, accompanied by a systolic ejection click. An aortic diastolic murmur is uncommon, particularly when compared with patients with discrete subvalvar stenosis. A severe lesion is characterized by palpable pulse of low volume and slow upstroke, single or reversed splitting of second heart sound, apical fourth and sometimes third heart sound, and thrusting LV impulse.

Many investigators have concluded that physical signs are unreliable in assessing severity of valvar stenosis in children.C16,E6,F13,G10,J8,W1 However, physical signs can be used to differentiate among mild, moderate, and severe lesions in most patients, and severe lesions can always be distinguished from mild ones.H13

#### Electrocardiography

The electrocardiogram (ECG) usually shows severe LV hypertrophy but can be near normal.H11 Right ventricular hypertrophy on the ECG may be associated with a left-toright shunt at atrial level through a stretched patent foramen ovale and rarely a reversed shunt at ductus level.S8

#### Chest Radiography

The ascending aorta frequently is prominent in older children but is small in neonates and infants. Increased heart size is seldom seen except in neonates and infants in heart failure, in whom it may be marked. Radiologically demonstrable valvar calcification is rare in patients younger than age 25.

#### Noninvasive Studies

Two-dimensional echocardiography has become particularly important as a diagnostic tool. In neonates and infants, morphology and severity of narrowing of the valve and size, wall thickness, and contractility of the LV can be assessed.B14,G9,W6 The congenitally stenotic aortic valve can be continuously reevaluated by Doppler ultrasound measurement of flow velocity across stenotic valves,H6 which can be used to quantify transvalvar pressure gradient.S23 Echocardiographic markers are useful for managing fetuses with important aortic stenosis. Serial measurements of fetal cardiac size and function may predict postnatal outcome.M9

Estimation of subendocardial oxygen requirements may be helpful in assessing severity of stenosis.K16,L10

## Cardiac Catheterization and Angiography

A systolic gradient across the aortic valve can be demonstrated at cardiac catheterization, usually through a retrograde aortic approach if possible or otherwise a transseptal approach. Cardiac output can also be measured so that valve area can be calculated. Systolic gradient greater than 75 mmHg or valve area less than 0.5 cm2 · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> is indicative of severe stenosis (see "Summary" in text that follows). Measuring gradient and valve area at cardiac catheterization has become less important as echocardiographic measurements have become more accurate. A raised LV end-diastolic pressure indicates LV failure or a fibrotic and noncompliant ventricle.

Angiography demonstrates thickened leaflets that form a dome in systole, with a localized jet of contrast entering the aorta (Fig. 47-6). Although this type of study is not reliable in assessing severity of stenosis, it can assess size of the aortic "anulus" and LV. An aortic root injection allows quantification of aortic regurgitation if present.

#### Summary

By a combination of clinical and hemodynamic assessments (echocardiography, cardiac catheterization), patients with congenital valvar aortic stenosis can be categorized as having mild, moderate, or severe obstruction.H13 *Mild* implies that pulse volume and contour are normal, as is the second heart sound. Patients with these findings have an LV-aortic systolic pressure difference less than 40 mmHg at rest, with a mean of 20 mmHg. Patients with *moderate* stenosis have an abnormally small pulse volume on palpation and abnormal contour, and narrow inspiratory splitting of the second heart sound may be present. Such patients generally have systolic gradients less than 75 mmHg, with a mean of 20 to 50 mmHg. Patients with *severe* stenosis have a systolic gradient in excess of 75 mmHg and an abnormal pulse volume and contour, as well as a single second heart sound or reverse splitting. These patients have a mean calculated aortic valve area index of less than 0.5 cm² · m⁻². H¹³

#### **NATURAL HISTORY**

Congenital valvar aortic stenosis is three to four times more common in males than in females and occurs in about 5% of Caucasians with congenital heart disease.

![](_page_5_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Figure 47-6** Angiographic signs of aortic stenosis. In *valvar stenosis*, there is systolic doming and a jet between thickened cusps. Poststenotic dilatation of aorta is visible. In fibrous *subvalvar stenosis*, a jet may be seen and cusps may not open fully, but doming is absent. The membrane should be visible, and there is often mild aortic regurgitation. In *supravalvar stenosis*, narrowing commencing above aortic cusps is visible. Sinuses of Valsalva are prominent, and coronary arteries are often dilated.

## Presentation in Infancy

When neonates and infants present with valvar stenosis, the lesion is typically severe, with rapidly progressive heart failure and death within a few days to a few weeks of birth. Thus, most neonates and young infants come to intervention (currently with percutaneous balloon valvotomy) critically ill and in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV or V (Table 47-3). Many have other anomalies associated with the spectrum of the hypoplastic left heart physiology. Ten Harkel and colleagues noted a 5-year survival rate of 73% among patients presenting in infancy.<sup>T2</sup>

#### Presentation in Childhood

When symptoms are delayed beyond age 1 year, heart failure is rare, and survival without treatment generally is prolonged. Also, associated anomalies are less common. The Second Natural History Study of Congenital Heart Defects includes data on many patients treated for valvar aortic stenosis and followed for 25 years. Res Patients were 2 years or older at entry into the study, and 40% managed medically subsequently required surgical management. For patients presenting with LV-aortic pressure gradient greater than 50 mm Hg, 70% required surgical intervention. Almost 40% of patients required a second operation.

Survival is related to (1) sudden death in untreated children and (2) rate of progression of stenosis.

#### Sudden Death

Occurrence of *sudden death* varies between 1% and 19% of patients. B19,C2,G10,M4,O2,P2 Of 58 patients younger than 35 years old who died suddenly and were found to have congenital heart disease, three (5%) had aortic valve stenosis. B3 Analysis of the literature and of a series of 218 patients with congenital valvar stenosis indicates that sudden death directly attributable to aortic stenosis is virtually confined to patients with a severe lesion. H13 Sudden death in patients with no symptoms and normal physical findings except for the murmur of aortic stenosis has not been documented. Sudden death may occur

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>b</sup>Patients were categorized into NYHA classes I to V, with class V indicating those undergoing emergency operation because of shock or metabolic acidosis.

**Figure 47-7** Cumulative incidence curves (multiple decrement; see "Competing Risks" in Section IV of Chapter 6) for 153 patients presenting with originally mild congenital valvar aortic stenosis. Vertical bars represent 70% confidence limits. Mean age at presentation was 6.5 years (1 to 25 years) and mean follow-up 8.8 years (1 to 26 years). The one death was caused by infective endocarditis. Patients underwent operation when stenosis was considered severe. Percentages refer to distances between curves. Key: *AS,* Aortic stenosis. (From Hossack and colleagues.H13)

in patients with a normal ECG,H13 but this finding is not incompatible with severe stenosis. Thus, the true prevalence of sudden death in children and adolescents in whom surgery is deferred until the lesion is considered severe on clinical grounds is probably about 1%.

## *Progression of Stenosis*

When congenital aortic valvar deformities are nonobstructive in infancy and childhood, less than 10% progress to mild obstruction within about 10 years. Leech, Mills, and colleagues obtained information on 26 patients aged 1 week to 29 years when first seen, and in whom diagnosis of nonobstructive aortic valve deformity was made based on an isolated aortic ejection sound.L6 During a 5- to 16-year follow-up, two patients (7%; CL 2%-16%) developed signs of mild stenosis after 7 and 15 years.M21 As more years pass, an undetermined time-related proportion of patients with deformed (usually congenitally bicuspid) aortic valves develop progressive thickening and calcification and ultimately important stenosis. Vollebergh and Becker suggest that minor inequality of size of tricuspid valves present from birth may lead to formation of senile or degenerative type of aortic valve stenosis presenting in the seventh or eighth decade of life.V3

When *mild* stenosis is present at first evaluation in childhood, progression is more rapid. Moderate or severe stenosis develops in about 20% of patients within 10 years and in 45% within about 20 years (Fig. 47-7). Even after this long interval, therefore, 55% of the mild lesions remain mild.

When *moderate* stenosis is present initially, the lesion becomes severe within 10 years in about 60% of patients (Fig. 47-8).

## *Infective Endocarditis*

Spontaneously occurring infective endocarditis appears in less than 1% of patients. The reported incidence is 1.8 to 2.7 episodes per 1000 patient-years.G7,H13 Infective endocarditis may produce aortic regurgitation and may be a cause of death.

**Figure 47-8** Cumulative incidence curves for 54 patients presenting with originally moderate congenital valvar aortic stenosis *(AS).* Vertical bars represent 70% confidence limits. Mean age at presentation was 12 years (1-25 years) and mean follow-up 8.5 years (1-24 years). The two deaths were both sudden, 4 and 9 years after presentation, in association with progression to severe stenosis. Percentages refer to distances between curves.

## TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

## Percutaneous Balloon Valvotomy

Percutaneous balloon valvotomy is often used for treating congenital valvar aortic stenosis, but a description of this technique is beyond the scope of this text. Its place in treating neonates is discussed under Special Situations and Controversies later in this section.

## Valvotomy in Neonates and Critically Ill Infants

Closed techniques and surface cooling for hypothermic circulatory arrest have largely been replaced by aortic valvotomy on CPB using cold cardioplegic myocardial management.

Anesthetic and supportive management must be precise (see Section II of Chapter 4). Drifting downward of body temperature to 32°C to 34°C is probably advantageous. Preparation and median sternotomy are described under "Preparation for Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2. As the pericardium is being opened, care is taken to touch the heart as seldom as possible because ventricular fibrillation is easily provoked. The purse-string suture is placed for the aortic cannula, the patient heparinized, and the cannula inserted and connected to the arterial tubing. Only then is a purse-string suture placed around the right atrial appendage; if the heart fibrillates, CPB can be established in less than a minute. A single venous cannula is inserted, and CPB is begun with the perfusate at 34°C; the ductus arteriosus is ligated, perfusate taken to 20°C to 28°C, aorta clamped, cold cardioplegia administered, and the perfusate temperature is then taken to 34°C to 36°C. In the presence of aortic regurgitation to a degree that interferes with cardioplegia delivery, cardioplegia can be delivered via small olive tip catheters directly into the coronary ostia, or coronary sinus cardioplegia can be used.

![](_page_7_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Figure 47-9** Aortic valvotomy. **A,** Operation is performed on cardiopulmonary bypass with aorta occluded. Electromechanical arrest of heart is achieved by infusion of cold cardioplegic solution. A transverse aortotomy is made above sinutubular junction to preserve integrity of aortic root. **B,** Aortic valve is exposed by gentle retraction of aortotomy anteriorly. Valve is inspected to determine optimal location for incision of commissures. Only commissures with adequate cusp attachment to aortic wall are opened; rudimentary commissures (raphe) should not be incised. **C,** Incision of commissure is deepened in stages, and cusps on each side are evaluated for lack of prolapse before further incision; incision is carried no further if prolapse is suspected. Usually, incision may be carried to aortic wall in well-supported commissures.

A transverse aortotomy is made (Fig 47-9, *A*). Two stay sutures are placed on the upstream side of the aortotomy for exposure. The aortic valve is inspected to determine which of the commissures to incise. Only partially formed commissures should be incised; commissurotomy should not be performed where there is only a rudimentary raphe (Fig. 47-9, *B*).

Valvotomy is performed by dividing fused commissures with a knife to within 1 mm of the aortic wall; in neonates the cusps are often gelatinous, but every effort still should be made to identify these commissures. It is important that even tension be placed on the two adjoining cusps so that incision is precise (Fig. 47-9, *C*). Only commissures with adequate cusp/commissural attachment to the aortic wall are opened, because division of rudimentary commissures produces regurgitation. Incisions are deepened in stages, and cusps on each side are evaluated for competence and lack of prolapse before each further incision.E4 If further incising of the commissure might cause cusp prolapse, the incision is carried no further. Occasionally, myxomatous nodules can be excised from the cusp's free edge, or fibrous thickening can be shaved off the ventricular aspect of one or more cusps. The aortotomy is then closed with a continuous suture. If there is any degree of aortic regurgitation by saline filling of the aortic root, a 6-0 polypropylene suture (Frater stitch) can be placed through the midpoint of each cusp and brought out through the closed aortotomy. The suture is removed when LV contraction begins.

The remainder of the procedure is completed as usual (see "Completing Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2). A left atrial catheter should be positioned before discontinuing CPB. If the neonate is of suitable size for placing a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe, the repair is evaluated before and after discontinuing CPB. LV and aortic pressures are measured and recorded before closing the chest.

#### Valvotomy in Older Infants, Children, and Adults

Preparation for operation, the incision, and preparations for CPB are described under "Preparation for Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2. Using a single venous cannula or caval cannulation, CPB is established at 28°C. A left atrial or LV vent is used. External cardiac cooling may be applied. The aorta is clamped and cold cardioplegic solution infused. The transverse aortotomy is made, and stay sutures applied to edges of the incision for exposure. Commissurotomy is performed as described.

The aortotomy is closed by continuous stitches, and the rest of the operation is completed as usual (see "Completing Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2).

#### Cusp Reconstruction

Pericardial cusp extension valvuloplasty procedures (as described by Duran)D17 to compensate for deficiency of valvar tissue and increase the coaptation surface area have been applied primarily to regurgitant aortic valves (see Chapter 12). More recently, encouraging midterm results with these techniques applied to congenital aortic stenosis support their inclusion as surgical options. *Aortic cusp extension valvuloplasty* may be considered as an adjunctive procedure to primary open valvotomy or in reoperative situations with recurrent aortic stenosis or regurgitation following previous valvotomy. Before proceeding with valve reconstruction, preoperative echocardiographic studies should ascertain the absence of LV subaortic obstruction.

Following a median sternotomy, autologous pericardium is harvested, thoroughly cleaned of all fatty tissue and adhesions, treated with 0.625% glutaraldehyde solution for 3 to 5 minutes, and kept moist with normal saline. CPB, LV venting, and myocardial management are performed as described under "Valvotomy in Older Infants, Children, and Adults."

An oblique aortotomy is made, and the aortic valve evaluated for presence of complete but fused commissures and a raphe in congenitally bicuspid aortic valves. Each cusp is examined for thickness and mobility, free-edge irregularities, and tissue deficiency.

The valve is prepared for cusp extension by first thinning the thickened cusp edges. Fused commissures are incised out to the aortic wall, and subcommissural fusion or scar tissue is released to maximize cusp mobility. Bicuspid valves with a rudimentary raphe are tricupidized by incising through the fused cusp at the raphe all the way to the aortic wall (Fig. 47-10). The pericardial patches are each cut to a length determined by the diameter of the aorta, supplemented with an additional 15% to 20% to account for later pericardial shrinkage. Height of each patch is chosen to extend the line of coaptation of the repaired cusps about 5 mm higher than the highest cusp and to bring the extended cusps into a coaptation point in the center of the valve orifice. The pericardial extensions are sutured to each cusp with continuous 5-0 polypropylene, beginning in the center of the cusp and working toward the commissures. The extensions are attached to the aortic wall, creating neocommissures at the level of the sinutubular junction. Ilbawi and colleagues recommend leaving a little excess pericardial patch at the commissural level, secured with a pledgeted mattress suture through the

aortic wall.P6 With all the patch extensions in place, the newly constructed extensions are trimmed to provide a uniform cusp height and symmetric coaptation surface (see Fig. 47-10). Adequacy of the valve opening is examined, and initial valve competence is assessed by filling the aortic root with saline. Aortotomy closure and discontinuation of CPB are conducted as usual. Evaluation of valve function by TEE is performed before and following discontinuation of CPB. If aortic regurgitation is more than mild or if peak transvalvar gradient by TEE exceeds 30 mmHg,A2 consideration should be given to reestablishing CPB and revising the valve repair or, if improvement is not feasible, proceeding with valve replacement.

## Aortic Valve Replacement in Children

When viewed at operation, the congenitally stenotic aortic valve may be too extensively deformed to be opened and remain reasonably competent. However, this situation is rare in primary operations in patients younger than age 10 and uncommon in those younger than 20. It is more common when multiple prior balloon valvotomies have been performed, and particularly when progressive or recurrent stenosis is accompanied by moderate or worse aortic regurgitation.

Aortic valve replacement in older children may be done in a standard fashion using a mechanical prosthesis (see "Isolated Aortic Valve Replacement" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 12). It may also be performed in the standard freehand manner using an aortic valve allograft (see "Allograft Aortic Valve" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 12) or a pulmonary valve autograft (see "Autograft Pulmonary Valve" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 12). Because the aortic root and LV-aortic junction may be quite small in young children who require aortic valve replacement, aortic root enlargement (see "Root-Enlarging Technique" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 12) or replacement (see "Replacement of Aortic Valve and Ascending Aorta, En Bloc" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 12) may be advantageous. An aortic allograft can be used as the replacement device, or a pulmonary autograft may be preferred. The autograft has the advantage of remaining unchanged and uncompromised by host reaction, and it also may grow.

## SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Postoperative care after aortic valvotomy or other procedures discussed in this section are conducted in the manner generally used after intracardiac operations (see Chapter 5).

Whenever valvotomy is performed for congenital valvar aortic stenosis, long-term follow-up is indicated because of possible recurrence of stenosis requiring reoperation.

## RESULTS

#### Early (Hospital) Death

Hospital mortality for surgical treatment of congenital valvar aortic stenosis in heterogeneous groups of patients younger than 20 to 25 years of age is largely an unhelpful value because of the important role of incremental risk factors for death and the selection processes by which treatments (or no treatments) are chosen.

Mortality varies widely among patient subsets, with few or no deaths after valvotomy in children and young adults. E5,K17,P8 Mortality is higher in neonates, but the potential safety of an open approach in neonates with severe congenital aortic stenosis has been demonstrated. G6,M19 Still, the current preference in most centers is initial percutaneous balloon valvotomy. Multiple centers have achieved hospital mortalities of 15% or less in neonates. B1,B28,C15,M20,P3,T8 Again, however, mortality figures in heterogeneous groups of patients, even if all are neonates, are difficult to interpret, as demonstrated by Gaynor and colleagues and a Congenital Heart Surgeon's Society (CHSS) analysis. L14 In contrast to many situations in cardiac surgery, nearly all deaths after operation for congenital valvar aortic stenosis occur early postoperatively, most within 48 hours.

Success in salvaging such patients with emergency temporary extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO) or left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support has not been fully evaluated, but such support is advisable in the face of progressive circulatory failure (see "Treatment of Low Cardiac Output" in Chapter 5).

Hospital mortality after operations for congenital valvar aortic stenosis in patients older than age 1 year approaches zero.

#### Time-Related Survival

Overall survival up to 40 years is good after the primary operation for congenital valvar aortic stenosis in older infants and children. D8,T9 In very ill neonates and young infants, however, survival is compromised, primarily by high early risks. L7

A CHSS study of 320 neonates with critical aortic stenosis noted 1- and 5-year survival of 72% and 70%, respectively, among those receiving an initial procedure aimed at biventricular repair (Fig. 47-11).

#### Modes of Death

Almost all early deaths are in acute cardiac failure, G15 and theoretically most should be preventable by (1) stabilization of critically ill neonates and others (with ECMO or LVAD support if needed) so that operation is not performed in NYHA class V patients as it was in the past, J2 and (2) proper myocardial management. In neonates and young infants, however, many deaths result from (1) failure to appreciate the importance of coexisting components of the spectrum of the hypoplastic left heart physiology (see "Coarctation as Part of Hypoplastic Left Heart Physiology" under Morphology in Section I of Chapter 48), and (2) nonoptimal selection, in particular of a biventricular pathway rather than a single-ventricle pathway, at least in the present state of knowledge (see Indications for Operation later in this section). L14

Deaths occurring late after operation are in various modes, and inferences are made with difficulty. Thus "sudden death" has been reported as the mode of death in 12% of patients included in one long-term follow-up study, but the majority had severe residual or recurrent stenosis or severe aortic regurgitation. H14 Among neonates for whom staging of repair is necessary for a univentricular pathway, few late deaths now occur between the cavopulmonary shunt stage and completed Fontan. L14

#### Incremental Risk Factors for Premature Death

#### Coexisting Severe Left-Sided Cardiac Anomalies

Left-sided cardiac defects (components of the spectrum of the hypoplastic left heart physiology, such as small aortic valve diameter, aortic hypoplasia, severe endocardial fibroelastosis, LV hypoplasia, extreme LV hypertrophy with small cavity size, and congenital mitral valve disease<sup>K7</sup>) are associated with high mortality after operation C17,H5,L14 (Table 47-4). These coexisting major cardiac anomalies, poor preoperative functional class, and young age at admission tend to occur together, and all are risk factors.

The important study by Karl and colleagues from Melbourne, Australia, emphasized the major role of these coexisting important cardiac anomalies in the early postsurgical mortality in neonates. <sup>K3</sup> No deaths (0%; CL 0%-19%) occurred after open valvotomy in neonates with no coexisting anomaly or only a patent ductus, whereas early mortality was 47% (CL 39%-62%) among those with important coexisting cardiac anomalies.

Data from Lofland and colleagues.L14

*a* Single early hazard phase (see Fig. 47-11, *B*).

## *Poor Preoperative Functional Class*

Advanced symptoms, or NYHA class IV and particularly class V, are associated with a considerably increased risk of death early after operation. Thus, for patients preoperatively in NYHA class I or II (most older infants and children), 15-year survival (all deaths, including those in hospital) after the primary valve operation is about 90%.A4,B7 In preoperatively very ill neonates and young infants, 10-year survival is about 30%.P3 However, the risk of death in the constant hazard phase (after about 5 years postoperatively) is no greater in this group than in older patients.

These ideas came from an era when critically ill neonates and young infants were not resuscitated preoperatively by the infusion of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). This risk factor can be neutralized at a cost of only about 5% mortality among neonates by management that includes stabilization on PGE1 and usually low-dose inotropic support.J2

#### *Type of Congenital Valvar Aortic Stenosis*

In a few patients, a truly unicuspid or severely dysplastic bicuspid valve may be essentially uncorrectable.C7 In a few patients, the very small aortic anulus may prevent a satisfactory outcome. Again, these situations usually are found in very sick neonates and young infants. Currently such patients typically are managed by a staged protocol leading to a univentricular repair.L14

#### *Young Age*

Very young age at operation is associated with a high risk of early death postoperatively.L7,L14 However, in the past, most patients coming to operation as neonates have been in NYHA functional class IV or V. It is important to recall, however, that with contemporary medical management, survival after operation is possible in critically ill neonates and young infants.B1,B7,C23,J2,K3,K7,T6

Data from 78 patients, UAB experience 1967-1982. Key: *NYHA,* New York Heart Association.

#### Functional Status

Most surviving patients, including those who have had reoperations, are in NYHA class I or II (Table 47-5). Objective evidence of improvement in functional capacity is provided by Whitmer and colleagues, who demonstrated marked regression of exercise-induced ST depression 1 year after operation, as well as an increase in mean total work and peak exercise systolic blood pressure.W7

## Electrocardiographic Changes

ECG evidence of LV hypertrophy may persist after valvotomy or valve replacement either because of residual stenosis or regurgitation or a progressive secondary cardiomyopathy. Intraoperative damage to the LV or preexisting ischemic myocardial fibrosis exacerbated by delaying operation can contribute to or cause this condition.E7,M25 Usually, however, LV hypertrophy is reversible.

#### Left Ventricular Morphology and Function

Preoperative inordinate LV hypertrophy and wall thickness often found in children with congenital valvar aortic stenosis often regresses after successful valvotomy or valve replacement, which reduces LV afterload and increases systolic function.D11

## Residual or Recurrent Left Ventricular–Aortic Pressure Gradients

Pressure gradient usually is substantially reduced after valvotomy and persists for 5 to 10 years.J1,L5,M8 Thereafter, the gradient tends to rise steadily, occurring earlier and more frequently when valvotomy was necessary during the neonatal period or in infancy.K7 In patients with a good initial result, the later rise in gradient is mainly the result of progressive cusp immobility and calcification.R10 Recurrence and progression of LV-aortic pressure gradient is usually an indication for reintervention with either percutaneous balloon valvotomy or operation.

Following aortic cusp extension procedures with autologous pericardium, long-term durability of repair has been incompletely studied. Alsoufi and colleagues have

emphasized the importance of satisfactory relief of aortic stenosis at the time of operation. Among 22 children who underwent this procedure, those with postoperative peak echocardiographic gradients of less than 30 mmHg had stabilization of their peak gradient over the next 2 to 3 years. However, progressive worsening of aortic stenosis was noted in those with early gradients exceeding 30 mmHg (moderate or greater aortic stenosis).

## Aortic Regurgitation

Important aortic valve regurgitation is uncommon after valvotomy when the operation has been performed as described (see Technique of Operation earlier in this section). Moderate to severe regurgitation without residual stenosis is present at late follow-up in about 10% of patients, but some regurgitation is combined with moderate or severe residual or recurrent stenosis in an additional 15% to 20%. Postoperative regurgitation occurs more frequently when valvotomy is radical, and particularly when an attempt is made to convert a bicuspid into a tricuspid valve. L5

#### Infective Endocarditis

The incidence of endocarditis is not lessened by valvotomy<sup>G7,H13,J7,R6</sup> and may even be somewhat higher than in the natural history. H13,H14

#### Diastolic Heart Failure

Rarely, patients with severe valvar aortic stenosis who undergo surgical or balloon valvotomy as neonates or in infancy develop severe diastolic heart failure years later. Robinson and colleagues at Boston Children's Hospital reported four such patients who presented 14 to 19 years after balloon valvotomy with heart failure and severe diastolic dysfunction.R11 All had evidence of a confluent layer of LV subendocardial hyperenhancement demonstrated by gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging that was documented by histopathology in two patients to be endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE). One patient experienced clinical improvement following aortic valve replacement and extensive EFE resection. Robinson and colleagues hypothesize that EFE may result from early (possibly in utero) and irreversible myocardial damage induced by subendocardial ischemia secondary to persistent pressure overload with decreased ventricular flow, which may gradually progress irrespective of relief of LV outflow obstruction.

#### Reintervention

As with time-related freedom from death, time-related depictions of freedom from reintervention and aortic valve replacement are of limited value when they are derived from a heterogeneous population.

In general, however, about 85% to 95% of children and young adults (excluding neonates and infants) are free of reintervention (usually valve replacement) for at least 10 years after the initial operation (Figs. 47-12 through 47-14). Then, although constant in the intermediate term, the hazard function (rate of reintervention) begins to rise. By 20 years after initial operation, only 60% of patients will be free of reintervention, and by 40 years only 10% will be free. D3 The older

the patient, the more likely it is that the reintervention will be valve replacement.

Reintervention appears to be required at a shorter interval and in greater prevalence when the initial intervention has been performed in neonatal life or infancy, and is more likely to consist of valvotomy than valve replacement. B1,B28,G1 Greater frequency of reintervention may be related to generally higher residual gradients in these cases. Reintervention appears to be required more frequently when initial valvotomy has been performed by some method other than an open

operation using CPB.P3 Reintervention rate increases 15 years after operation from 0.73% per year to 2.3% per year (*P* < .0001).D8

Procedures done at reoperation are generally more varied than at initial operation (Table 47-6). A satisfactory repeat valvotomy is sometimes possible, especially when the initial operation has been done in infancy.K7 At times, an overlooked second level of obstruction is found that requires treatment such as patch graft supravalvar enlargement, a Konno procedure (see Technique of Operation in Section II), or an aortic root replacement (see "Aortic Valve Replacement in Children" under Technique of Operation earlier in this section). These reoperations carry a low risk, but generally carry greater risk than primary operation (see Table 47-6).S2

Freedom from further reoperation following aortic valve cusp extension procedures has been variable, with freedom from subsequent aortic valve repair or replacement of 60% to 80% at 5 years and about 50% at 15 years.D4,P6,P7,Q1 Durability of repair appears greater if a tricuspid valve can be created.P7

## INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

#### Initial Valvotomy

## *Neonates and Young Infants*

In neonates and young infants with severe congenital valvar aortic stenosis, medical treatment is begun on an emergency basis.K7 When the diagnosis is suspected before transport of a neonate to a cardiac surgical center in the first week or two of life, or as soon as such a patient, usually moribund or in metabolic acidosis, is admitted, prostaglandin E1 is begun (see Indications for Operation in Chapter 49). This substance usually opens the ductus arteriosus, particularly if the neonate is just a few days old, improves systemic oxygenation, and relieves metabolic acidosis because the right ventricle can support both systemic and pulmonary circulations.J5,M18 The child's condition should be stable and good before operation is begun.

Before intervention, care must be taken to distinguish the neonates or very young infants with isolated severe congenital valvar aortic stenosis from those whose anomaly is part of the spectrum of hypoplastic left heart physiology. When the anomaly is hypoplastic left heart physiology class III (see Table 48-1 in Chapter 48), the Norwood operation rather than aortic valvotomy is indicated; simple aortic valvotomy is futile.R8 The criteria for using the more extensive operation are (1) mitral valve area less than 4.75 cm2 · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ; (2) LV inflow dimension less than 25 mm; (3) small LV, evidenced by a ratio between the apex-to-base dimension of the LV and that of the right ventricle of less than 0.8; or (4) transverse cavitary and aortic "anular" dimension of 6 mm or less.B28,L3,L9,P3,R8

In the Congenital Heart Surgeons multi-institutional study of decision making based on 362 neonates, greater intermediate-term survival was obtained by a strategy of an initial Norwood procedure vs. two-ventricle strategy if the arch was small, LV dysfunction was present, or LV outflow tract was small, particularly when less than 4 mm.H9 Colan and colleagues have also developed and subsequently revalidated a scoring algorithm for decision making in neonates with aortic stenosis and a mitral valve *z* value of greater than −2.C17

In those patients in whom aortic valvotomy alone is indicated, the decision to use percutaneous balloon aortic valvotomy (see Special Situations and Controversies later in this section) or surgical valvotomy remains controversial. Surgical valvotomy may be accomplished by closed transventricular valvotomy,T6,T7 open surgical valvotomy with CPB, or using hypothermic or normothermic circulatory arrest. The preference is for surgical valvotomy using CPB, as well as more sophisticated methods of myocardial management than have been generally used. However, a large trial may be the only way to determine comparative outcomes in this complex setting.F8

## *Older Infants and Children*

Severe congenital valvar aortic stenosis is an indication for operation in older infants and children. Symptoms of angina or syncope always indicate severe stenosis and thus are indications for operation.D16 Conversely, severe stenosis requiring operation frequently occurs without symptoms, but in such circumstances there will usually be physical signs,H13 particularly in the pulse and behavior of the second heart sound. Also, the ECG will usually show an LV hypertrophy pattern; an ECG that shows severe hypertrophy (important ST-T depression) is an indication for operation even if the gradient is less than 50 mmHg.

Mild congenital aortic stenosis is not an indication for operation. Because of the natural history, these patients require long-term periodic noninvasive reevaluation and invasive study and operation if indicated.

Older infants and children with moderate stenosis are a controversial group. Many recommend operation,B7,C18,E5,M29 and others recommend periodic reevaluation of LVaortic gradient,C16,E6,F13,W1 subendocardial oxygen requirement,K16,L10 or valve area. Those against possibly premature operation argue that (1) sudden death is rare in children whose systolic gradient is 50 to 75 mmHg, (2) operation and probable valve replacement will still be necessary, and (3) valve replacement cannot be delayed by early operation. Therefore, operation usually is not recommended in this group, but is advised if stenosis becomes severe on repeated noninvasive follow-up.

#### Reoperation

When restenosis becomes severe or when symptoms develop with moderate restenosis, reoperation is indicated. Initially, dysplastic valve cusps should not be a contraindication to reoperation, because in a number of patients the cusps have been more normal in appearance at reoperation than in early life.K7 Although repeat valvotomy or valve replacement is usually required, subvalvar stenosis may have also developed and must not be overlooked. Important subvalvar stenosis is often associated with a small "anulus," as well as some supravalvar narrowing. In this case a Konno operation, aortic root replacement operation, or Ross-Konno operation may be advisable.

## SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

#### Technique of Operation

Periodic enthusiasm for closed transventricular aortic valvotomy in critically ill neonates and young infants is motivated by high early mortality in this group.T7 Closed transventricular dilatations have been performed with Hegar dilators and balloon catheters designed for percutaneous use.B25,T7 Considering the early mortality, need for reintervention, and amount of valvar regurgitation produced, however, no convincing evidence indicates that this method is as good as or superior to the techniques described under Technique of Operation earlier in this section.P3

A few groups have preferred to perform valvotomy under inflow stasis at normothermia or mild hypothermia.C23 Operation under these circumstances is a semiopen one, and forceful stretching or tearing of the valve may result if exposure is not ideal. In children, the method can be used safely, but 7 (26%; CL 17%-37%) of 27 patients followed up to 15 years by Stewart and colleagues had moderate or severe aortic valve regurgitation.S28 Sink and colleagues reported two (25%; CL 9%-50%) hospital deaths among eight infants, six of whom were neonates.S14

Ilbawi and colleagues reported use of extended aortic valvuloplasty in which the commissurotomy incision is extended into the aortic wall around the cusp insertion, mobilizing the valve cusp attachment at the commissures and freeing the aortic insertion of the rudimentary commissure.I1 They showed reduced aortic valve gradients compared with standard aortic valvotomy at 1.7 years after operation. The method has possible merit, but has not had wide application. Kadri and colleagues, as well as Tolan and colleagues, have described similar operations in which the raphe or fused commissure of the larger cusp of a bicuspid aortic valve is incised, and a triangular piece of pericardium is folded and inserted between the free edges of the incised raphe.K1,T5 Autologous or bovine pericardium is attached to the free edges of the incised raphe and vertically to the aortic wall.K1,T5 This procedure produces a tricuspid valve and restores the deficient intercusp triangle, preventing cusp prolapse. Experience with this and other cusp reconstruction procedures (see "Cusp Reconstruction" under Technique of Operation earlier in this section) is limited, so caution should be used in applying these methods until more is known about their efficacy in palliating aortic valve stenosis.

## Percutaneous Balloon Aortic Valvotomy in Neonates, Infants, and Children

Percutaneous balloon aortic valvotomy for severe aortic stenosis in neonates was described by Rupprath and Neuhaus in 1985 and Lababidi and Weinhaus in 1986.L1,R13 A large experience with this technique has accumulated since then, well summarized in the neonatal group by Zeevi and colleagues from Boston Children's Hospital.Z1 They found no difference when the results were compared with those of surgical valvotomy in a previous era. Similar results have been reported by others.K4,O1,W10 New technology may improve results still further.B5,R14

In the Congenital Heart Surgeons multi-institutional study, 110 neonates for whom the strategy for management was biventricular repair were treated by either surgical (*n* = 28) or percutaneous balloon (*n* = 82) aortic valvotomy.M10 Propensity score adjustment (see "Clinical Studies with Nonrandomly Assigned Treatment" in Section I of Chapter 6) was used to account for procedure selection bias and achieve comparability of patient characteristics. Timerelated survival to age 5 years was similar after surgical and percutaneous balloon aortic valvotomy, as was risk of reintervention.

Moore and colleagues studied midterm results of balloon dilatation of congenital aortic stenosis performed at Boston Children's Hospital in 148 children, all more than 1 month old.M27 Mortality was 0.7% and was successful in 87% of patients, with average peak gradient reduction of 56% ± 20%. At 8 years postoperatively, 95% were alive, but only 50% were free of another intervention (surgical or repeat balloon aortic valvotomy). Aortic valve regurgitation of grade 3 or higher occurred immediately after the procedure in 13% (CL 10%-16%) and was a major factor in determining another intervention.

Gatzoulis and colleagues compared results of balloon aortic valvotomy in 34 children (8 neonates) and surgical valvotomy in 17 children (7 neonates) treated between 1988 and 1993.G4 Results were equivalent. Two deaths occurred in each group, attributable to small LVs. Peak gradient reduction was equivalent.

Shim and colleagues showed that repeat balloon aortic valvotomy is an effective palliative procedure for children with aortic valve stenosis.S10 Repeat balloon aortic valvotomy provided immediate gradient reduction comparable with the results reported with initial balloon valvotomy, with no increased risk of developing aortic regurgitation.

Hawkins and colleagues followed 60 patients for 1 to 110 months after balloon aortic valvotomy.H7 Operation was required in 23 patients (38%), and aortic valve operation was required in 5% to 7% of patients per year after balloon aortic valvotomy. Aortic valve regurgitation was the predominant indication. Aortic valve repair (valvotomy) was possible in 9 of 23 patients requiring operation after balloon aortic valvotomy. Aortic valve replacement was required in the remaining 14 patients.

Sandhu and colleagues showed that balloon aortic valvotomy can be effective in young adults with congenital aortic stenosis.S1 Of 15 patients aged 16 to 24 years having balloon aortic valvotomy, three required aortic valve replacement for high residual gradient or severe aortic valve regurgitation. Immediate reduction of the pressure gradient by 55% persisted for an average of 1.5 years. Equivalent results were found in 70 children.

Beneficial results of balloon aortic valvotomy in adult patients, especially those with degenerative aortic stenosis, are not long lasting, and restenosis occurs in most patients within 6 months. Wang and colleagues reviewed results of balloon aortic valvotomy in adults, including results from two large registries.W2 They concluded that long-term survival for adults after balloon aortic valvotomy is similar to the natural history of untreated severe aortic stenosis. Survival for patients having balloon valvotomy alone at 3 years was less than 25%, vs. almost 90% for those having balloon aortic valvotomy followed by aortic valve replacement. Balloon aortic valvotomy is reserved only for those patients who are not candidates for aortic valve replacement because of comorbid illness or advanced age. Balloon aortic valvotomy has not been effective in reducing risk of noncardiac surgery or acting as a bridge to future aortic valve replacement (see Special Situations and Controversies in Chapter 12).

Even with these data, it remains difficult to evaluate balloon aortic valvotomy and determine its effectiveness compared with surgical valvotomy. Immediate, early, and probably midterm results appear to be equivalent to operation in the neonate and child and perhaps in the young adult with congenital aortic stenosis. Long-term results are not currently available. Balloon aortic valvotomy is not effective treatment for adult patients, especially when aortic stenosis is the degenerative type. Application of percutaneous balloon aortic valvotomy seems to be determined by local preference at present.

# **Section II Congential Discrete Subvalvar Aortic Stenosis**

#### DEFINITION

Congenital discrete subvalvar aortic stenosis is an obstruction beneath the aortic valve caused by either a short, localized, fibrous or fibromuscular ridge or a longer diffuse fibrous tunnel. "Diffuse subvalvar aortic stenosis" is a phrase best not used to avoid confusion; it was originally used to distinguish what is now termed *hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy* (HOCM) from congenital aortic stenosis (see Chapter 19).K13

Subvalvar aortic stenosis may also be a part of other cardiac anomalies. In these situations, the obstruction may be fibromuscular and indistinguishable from the entity discussed here or may consist of a localized muscular bar or shelf (e.g., in coarctation or aortic arch interruption with VSD) or abnormalities of the mitral valve. In other words, subvalvar aortic stenosis, as well as valvar stenosis, may be part of the spectrum of hypoplastic left heart physiology.

## HISTORICAL NOTE

The first description of discrete subvalvar stenosis is attributed to Chevers in 1842.C8 In 1956, Brock and Fleming from Guys Hospital in London published an early report of diagnosing the condition during life using transventricular puncture to measure LV pressure.B21 The catheter was then advanced across the aortic valve from below and the level of obstruction demonstrated. Brock reported results of transventricular dilatation in 1959.B20 Spencer and colleagues published the first substantial report of treatment using CPB in 1960.S18 The lesion was illustrated clearly in patients operated on at the Mayo Clinic between 1956 and 1960.E4,E5

The long fibrous tunnel form of the stenosis was described by Spencer and was later reemphasized by Reis and Morrow and colleagues.R7 Its effective treatment under difficult circumstances became possible with the introduction of aortoventriculoplasty by Rastan and Koncz, and independently by Konno and colleagues in 1975.K15,R2,R3 Complete relief of subvalvar stenosis without sacrifice of the aortic valve became possible with the introduction of the modified Konno operation in 1978 (see Technique of Operation later in this section). The aortoseptal approach was introduced by Vouhe and colleagues in 1984.V5 An alternative form of treatment, LV-aortic conduit, was developed about the same time.C21,N5

## MORPHOLOGY

#### Left Ventricular Outflow Tract

## *Localized Subvalvar Aortic Stenosis*

The localized form of discrete subvalvar aortic stenosis may be fibrous or fibromuscular. The *fibrous* form involves a spectrum of pathology varying from a discrete short fibrous ridge, a thicker but still discrete fibromuscular shelf, to a long fibrous tunnel. When a fibrous ridge is firmly adherent to a hypertrophied septum anteriorly and to the left, the condition is termed *discrete fibromuscular stenosis.*K12,N4

Whether isolated, localized, or only muscular, subvalvar stenosis occurring as an entity separate from HOCM is controversial.

An obstructing localized circumferential fibrous shelf or ridge may be situated at any level between the nadir of the aortic cusps and the free edge of the anterior mitral leaflet, as well as anywhere along the aortic-mitral anulus. An immediately subvalvar fibrous ridge may be adherent to the base of the aortic cusps (only the right or all threeF3), but more often it is separated from the cusps by several millimeters. Such a high (distal) ridge tends to be narrow, and unless there

is severe LV hypertrophy, the remainder of the outflow beneath it remains relatively normal.K12 A low (proximal) fibrous ridge may be attached almost at the hinge line of the anterior mitral leaflet, but most frequently it occupies an intermediate position well above this and several millimeters below the aortic valve (Fig. 47-15). Usually the ridge is 2 to 3 mm thick and is more prominent anteriorly and laterally than posteriorly on the aortic-mitral anulus. The ridge may be present as a complete fibrous diaphragm, however, and the stenotic orifice may be central and circular or eccentric and slitlike. The aortic-mitral anulus is longer than normal in hearts with discrete subvalvar aortic stenosis, and on average, the diameter of the aortic valve anulus is smaller than normal.R12 The muscular ventricular septum beneath the right aortic cusp shows a variable degree of hypertrophy and prominence, and in severe cases may contribute importantly to the stenosis.

## *Tunnel Subvalvar Aortic Stenosis*

Much less common, tunnel stenosis presents as a circumferential irregular zone of fibrosis commencing at or close to the LV-aortic junction ("anulus") and extending downward for 10 to 30 mm.M3,R7,S18 Tunnel stenosis has varying degrees of severity, and its spectrum blends into localized subvalvar aortic stenosis. In its most severe form the form that requires a special surgical procedure—the stenotic tunnel is long and the diameter of the aortic anulus small, even though aortic valve cusps are normally formed. In patients with less severe disease, the tunnel may be shorter and aortic anulus normal in size; morphology then resembles localized fibromuscular discrete subvalvar aortic stenosis.K12 These gradations explain the differing prevalences in reported series. Fibrous stenosis is sufficiently long to justify the term *tunnel* in about one fifth of cases of congenital subvalvar aortic stenosis; the full-blown entity with anular hypoplasia is rare.

## Aortic Valve

The aortic valve is usually tricuspid and either entirely normal or has some diffuse cusp thickening. Trivial or mild aortic regurgitation is present in about two thirds of patients. The aortic valve, however, may be bicuspid, and congenital commissural fusion may produce varying degrees of valvar stenosis. The valve may have been damaged by endocarditis, a complication of subvalvar stenosis,M28,M32 which can result in severe regurgitation. Rarely, the subaortic membrane may be infected. Bases of valve cusps are thick when a high-lying fibrous ridge is continuous with them.

Infrequently, supravalvar as well as valvar stenosis coexists with the subvalvar narrowing. This combination is at the mild end of the spectrum of hypoplastic left heart physiology.

#### Left Ventricle

The LV is usually concentrically hypertrophied. Subendocardial ischemia, and probably fibrosis, occur in subvalvar aortic stenosis as well as in congenital valvar stenosis.C4 Rarely, there may be excessive hypertrophy of the septum (vs. thickening of the posterior LV wall) and muscle fiber disorientation histologically.B15,M3 This histology complicates the distinction in a few patients between discrete subvalvar aortic stenosis and HOCM.

Roberts and his group have noted coronary artery luminal narrowing due to structural wall changes of intramural coronary arteries in both humans and dogs with fibrous subvalvar aortic stenosis.M3,M32 These changes have not been observed in valvar aortic stenosis.

## Coexisting Cardiac Anomalies

Discrete subvalvar aortic stenosis occurs as an isolated anomaly in only about half to two thirds of patients coming to operation.C5,H3,K12 Coexisting anomalies include a VSD that is frequently large,L4,M2,N4 and the fibromuscular obstruction is then often located immediately below (upstream to) the VSD. When there is aortic arch interruption and patent ductus arteriosus or occasionally coarctation, localized muscular subvalvar stenosis may be associated with a subpulmonary VSD.F9,V1 Valvar or infundibular pulmonary stenosisN2 and occasionally tetralogy of Fallot, atrial septal defect, aortopulmonary window, sinus of Valsalva aneurysm, and aneurysm of the membranous ventricular septum may also coexist, occurring more frequently in pediatric surgical patients.

The complex relationship between VSD and discrete subvalvar aortic stenosis is further evidenced by stenosis developing after spontaneous closure or narrowing of the VSD.C12 Typical discrete subvalvar aortic stenosis may also develop both before and after repair of a complete atrioventricular (AV) septal defect, repair of coarctation, LV-to-aorta internal rerouting in double outlet right ventricle or transposition with VSD, and other forms of congenital cardiac anomalies.B6,G14,K2,T4

## Other Types of Discrete Subvalvar Aortic Stenosis

Localized subvalvar aortic stenosis may be caused by morphology and mechanisms other than those just described. In an autopsy series that included complex congenital heart disease, Freedom and colleagues found the typical fibrous or fibromuscular variety to be the least common in infancy.F9 Mitral valve anomalies involving accessory tissue or leaflet malposition (including that found in AV septal defects) may be a cause of obstructionE2,G12,K19 and may occur in the absence of functional abnormality of the mitral valve or other cardiac anomalies.M7 Localized muscular obstructions related to abnormal infundibular development or malalignment are frequent and often associated with a VSD and aortic coarctation or interruption.S13 A developmental complex described by Shone and associates consists of a parachute mitral valve and LV outflow tract obstruction that usually includes localized fibromuscular subaortic stenosis.S11 Discrete muscular subvalvar aortic stenosis may develop after pulmonary trunk banding for VSD.F6

## CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

#### Symptoms

Symptoms of congenital subvalvar aortic stenosis are similar to those of the valvar variety. About 25% of patients requiring operation are asymptomatic despite presence of important obstruction.

#### Signs

A systolic ejection murmur is heard, but a click is rare. There is an unimpressive aortic diastolic murmur in 65% of patients. It is secondary either to (1) cusp thickening with or without adherence of the fibrous ridge to the cusps or (2) effects of eddy currents produced by the subvalvar stenosis upon aortic valve closure.

When severe stenosis is present, the pulse is slow rising, the second heart sound is single or paradoxically split, a third and occasionally fourth heart sound are audible, and a middiastolic murmur may be heard at the apex, usually in association with a fibrotic obstruction that limits anterior mitral leaflet movement.K12 It is important to recognize, particularly in children, that one or more of these signs may be minimal or absent despite severe obstruction.

Occasionally, aortic regurgitation may be caused by severe congenital cusp deformities or infective endocarditis. When endocarditis occurs on the aortic valve, signs of regurgitation produced by cusp destruction may be less than expected because a tight fibrous stenosis beneath the valve may limit aortic runoff. Moreover, vegetations on the fibrous shelf itself may increase subaortic obstruction.M32

![](_page_17_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 47-16** Two-dimensional echocardiogram in localized discrete subvalvar aortic stenosis. Fibromuscular ridge is observed narrowing left ventricular outflow tract below aortic valve.

## Chest Radiography

The ascending aorta is not usually dilated in the chest radiograph, and valvar calcification is absent. The LV is usually enlarged.

## Electrocardiography

The ECG usually shows severe LV hypertrophy.

## Echocardiography

Two-dimensional echocardiography can be diagnostic, accurately demonstrating and outlining the obstructing shelfC12,M3,W5 (Fig. 47-16). The technique is so sensitive that it can demonstrate a subvalvar discrete lesion before a gradient develops. Color flow Doppler imaging sufficiently defines the gradient across the obstruction to allow a definitive decision regarding operation. Siggrusson and colleagues suggested that the angle formed by the septum and aorta (aortoseptal angle) may have prognostic value in patients with discrete subaortic stenosis,S12 because it is steeper in patients with subaortic stenosis than in normal persons. They suggested this anatomic feature may be causative in development of this condition. M-mode echocardiography is helpful in differentiating this lesion from HOCM.B15,M3

#### Cardiac Catheterization and Cineangiography

Cardiac catheterization shows a systolic pressure gradient below the valve on withdrawal of the catheter across the LV outflow tract. When the fibrous ridge is immediately beneath the valve, the gradient may be apparent at valve level. Postectopic pressure pulse response is normal, and the aortic pulse contour does not show an accessory wave; these features distinguish the lesion from HOCM.

Angiography supports the definitive diagnosis.H3,K12,M3,N4 The tilted left anterior oblique (LAO) view provides good visualization of the fibrous ridge because it overcomes the foreshortening of the LV outflow tract region present in the conventional LAO projection (Figs. 47-17 through 47-19). Level and thickness of obstruction can be accurately defined in this manner, and additional valvar stenosis and regurgitation also can be evaluated.

## Summary

In discrete subvalvar aortic stenosis, features characteristic of HOCM are usually absent. Rarely, however, particularly in severe forms of fibrous subvalvar aortic stenosis,B15 including the tunnel variety,M3 there may be abnormal systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral leaflet and an abnormal postectopic response. These signs indicate either a particularly prominent anterior muscular shelf or, in patients who also show an abnormal septal to posterior wall thickness ratio on echocardiography (with disorientation of the muscular pattern of hypertrophy histologically), associated HOCM.

#### NATURAL HISTORY

Discrete subaortic stenosis is present in 8% to 30% of patients with congenital LV outflow tract obstruction.B18,K5,K11,M13,N4

The striking paucity of operations for discrete subvalvar aortic stenosis in the first year of life indicates the difference in life history of patients with congenital subvalvar aortic stenosis compared with patients with valvar stenosis. Typical discrete subvalvar aortic stenosis is rarely a cause of important obstruction in infancy.F9,H5,N4,S16 Rather, obstruction is often absent in early life and then becomes evident and progressively more severe in childhood or young adulthood.C11,F10,L8,S7 The subvalvar gradient has first appeared several years after an early study in infancy before VSD and coarctation repair. Also, the lesion appears infrequently after age 30, suggesting that survival beyond this time is rare without surgery or that the lesion gradually takes on the appearance of HOCM.K16

Pyle and colleagues provided further support for these concepts in their study of fibrous subaortic stenosis in Newfoundland dogs.P9 In these animals, subaortic stenosis was never present at birth but was important by 12 weeks of age. Evidence also shows that stenosis might be an inherited trait. A familial occurrence has been reported in humans.G1,L4,M3 Reports of serial cardiac catheterizations indicate that discrete subvalvar aortic stenosis progresses quite rapidly,F10,F14,H3,M24,N4 probably more rapidly than valvar stenosis. Such features probably explain why, in published surgical series in which ages of patients are listed, the youngest patients operated on are age 3 to 6 years and surgery is uncommon beyond age 20.C5,H3,K5,K12,L13,M3,S18

Aortic regurgitation, often associated with discrete subvalvar aortic stenosis, is progressive and caused by cusp thickening from poststenotic turbulence.N4 Cusp thickening most likely explains the frequency of endocarditis before and after surgical excision of the membrane.F5,M28,M32,S30

#### TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

## Resection of Localized Subvalvar Aortic Stenosis

Preparation for operation for congenital subvalvar aortic stenosis in children is accomplished as described for valvotomy in Section I. Fig. 47-20 shows anatomic relationships of the subaortic fibromuscular ridge.

A transverse aortotomy is made (Fig. 47-21, *A*). The aortic cusps are retracted and the subvalvar fibrous ridge exposed. Beginning beneath the nadir of the right coronary cusp, a vertical incision is made through the ridge and into the underlying muscle, with depth of incision proportional to estimated septal thickness (Fig. 47-21, *B*). A second incision parallel to the first is made through the ridge below the commissure between right and left aortic valve cusps. Excision of the fibromuscular ridge begins by carrying a vertical incision circumferentially between the parallel incisions

Anterior (septal) margin of outflow tract shows irregular encroachment by obstructing fibromuscular tissue.

**Figure 47-20** Anatomic relations of left ventricular outflow tract in subvalvar aortic stenosis. In this view, heart is bisected; anterior aspect is on left and posterior aspect on right. Inset shows subaortic ridge and left bundle branch of specialized conduction system below the surface of the ventricular septum, with nadir of right coronary cusp marking leftward limit of conduction system. Deep incision of ventricular septum is possible to the left of the midpoint of right coronary cusp.

(Fig. 47-21, *C*), removing fibrous tissue and myocardium deep into the ventricular septum until the mitral apparatus is encountered at the leftward extremity of the LV outflow tract. In this process, care is taken not to penetrate the ventricular septum and produce a VSD. As the dissection is carried down over the anterior mitral leaflet, only the fibrous ridge is removed, shaving it off the leaflet or mitral-aortic anulus with the knife or a Freer septum elevator (Fig. 47-21, *D*). Dissection is carried rightward as far as the mitral leaflet and mitral-aortic anulus extend.

Returning anteriorly, only the fibrous ridge is shaved off the muscular septum to the right of the nadir of the right coronary cusp using a knife or septum elevator (see Fig. 47-21, *D*). The ridge excision is carried rightward over the membranous septum. This technique preserves the integrity of the underlying bundle of His and cores out the entire subvalvar stenosis as a single mass. When the fibromuscular ridge is attached to the undersurface of the belly of one or more of the aortic cusps, it is carefully shaved away from the cusp tissue.

The procedure is not considered complete unless a generous amount of muscle has been removed leftward of the nadir of the right coronary cusp. If only the fibrous component has been enucleated,G2 a deep trough of muscle is cut from the ventricular septum anteriorly. The trough is centered beneath the commissure between the right and left aortic valve cusps as in the operation for HOCM (see Technique of Operation in Chapter 19). This step is of value even when the fibrous ridge is immediately subvalvar, because the ventricular septum is always hypertrophied.

Yacoub and colleagues propose mobilization of the left and right fibrous trigones along with extensive resection of all components of the subvalvular fibrous ring.Y1 Their proposition is based on the concept that the aortic and mitral orifices interact, with the fibrous trigones acting as a hinge mechanism for movement of the subaortic curtain and anterior mitral leaflet during the cardiac cycle. The incision to resect the fibrous ring is extended laterally at the location of the left and right fibrous trigones to excise this fibrous tissue in continuity with the obstructing ring. Resection of the left fibrous trigone carries the risk of creating an opening to the outside of the heart or into the anterior mitral leaflet, and injury to the conduction system could occur during resection of the right fibrous trigone. The technique was used in 57 consecutive patients operated on over the course of 25 years without these complications occurring. Pressure gradient over the LV outflow tract after the repair ranged from 0 to 30 mmHg (mean 8 mmHg), and no change in gradient was observed on follow-up assessment.

After determining that the ventricular septum has not been perforated and aortic valve cusps have not been damaged, the aortotomy is closed and the remainder of the procedure accomplished as described under Technique of Operation in Section I for valvotomy.

#### Ross-Konno Procedure

Aortic valve replacement may be required in some older children or adults when important aortic valve regurgitation coexists with severe subaortic stenosis. Modification of the Ross and Konno procedures is used in these patients (Ross-Konno procedure). CPB is established using either two cannulae for venous uptake (with venae cavae tourniquets) or a single two-stage cannula, with the atrial uptake placed deep in the atrium at the inferior vena cava (see "Preparation for Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2). Oxygenated blood is returned through a cannula in the ascending aorta. The aorta is occluded and cold cardioplegia administered through a cannula in the coronary sinus (see "Technique of Retrograde Infusion" in Chapter 3), directly into the coronary ostia, or both. The ascending aorta is divided and aortic valve excised. The coronary ostia are mobilized with a rim of sinus aorta, and the noncoronary sinus aorta is removed (see Chapter 12). The pulmonary trunk is removed from the right ventricular (RV) outflow tract in the usual manner for a Ross procedure (see "Autograft Pulmonary

![](_page_20_Figure_2.jpeg)

Broken lines indicate proposed incision points. **C,** Scalpel is used to make two incisions through fibromuscular ridge, with one below the commissure between right and left aortic valve cusps and the other parallel to first incision and beneath the nadir of right coronary cusp.

Valve" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 12). A slightly longer portion of the RV outflow tract below the pulmonary valve may be removed (Fig. 47-22, *A*). A short incision is made through the fibrous tissue of the aortic valve attachment at the nadir of the right coronary sinus into the ventricular septum, as in the Konno procedure (Fig. 47-22, *B*). This incision is not as deep into the septum as in the Konno procedure, however, and should not extend beyond the medial papillary muscle (Lancisi) of the tricuspid valve to avoid injury to the first septal branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The fibromuscular subaortic ridge is excised and septal myocardium shaved from the left side to reduce thickness of the hypertrophied ventricular septum in order to widen the LV outflow tract and completely relieve the obstruction (Fig. 47-22, *C*). The pulmonary autograft is then attached to the LV outflow tract (Fig. 47-22, *D*). The lengthened tongue of the attached RV outflow tract is inserted to the depth of the incision in the

Aorta is divided and aortic valve excised. Coronary arteries are mobilized with a button of sinus aorta. Rest of sinus aorta is removed. Pulmonary trunk is divided at its bifurcation and removed from right ventricular outflow tract. An extension of the anterior wall of right ventricular outflow tract may be included to fill defect in ventricular septum created by the Konno incision. **B,** An incision is made into ventricular septum (Konno) at the midpoint of right coronary sinus of Valsalva. This incision is not nearly as deep into ventricular septum as in the classic Konno operation, and ordinarily would not pass the depth of the medial papillary muscle (Lancisi) of the tricuspid valve to avoid injury to first septal branch of left anterior descending coronary artery. **C,** Subaortic obstructing ridge is cut away from ventricular septum on left side.

ventricular septum. If no extra length of RV outflow tract has been removed, the pulmonary autograft is simply inserted deeply into the LV outflow tract. The operation is completed as described for the Ross procedure (see "Autograft Pulmonary Valve" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 12).

#### Repair of Tunnel Stenosis by Aortoventriculoplasty (Konno Operation)

When a tunnel type of subaortic stenosis coexists with hypoplasia and narrowing of the LV-aortic junction, aortoventriculoplasty is a reasonable procedure, using the modification described by Misbach and Ebert and colleagues and others.K15,M23,R2,R3

The preliminaries and preparations for CPB are identical to those described earlier for congenital valvar aortic stenosis (see "Preparation for Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2). CPB is established using two caval cannulae and caval taping, because the RV will be opened. The aorta is occluded, cold cardioplegic solution is infused, and perfusate temperature is stabilized at 20°C to 25°C. Through a small oblique right atriotomy incision, the pump-oxygenator sump sucker is placed across a naturally occurring or surgically created foramen ovale.

Before establishing CPB, position of the right coronary artery must be accurately noted, and a marking stitch placed leftward from this to indicate the RV incision site. A vertical aortotomy is made beginning about 10 mm downstream to the level of the right coronary artery (Fig. 47-23, *A*). The incision is carried well to the left of the right coronary artery and onto the RV over the junction of the contiguous portions of right and left coronary cusps.D9 The right ventriculotomy may be made first to visualize the pulmonary valve cusps, because these lie near the point of entry of the incision into the RV. After the RV is opened, the scissors are positioned with one blade in the LV through the aortotomy and one in the RV through the ventriculotomy; a scissors cut is made to the left side of the nadir of the right coronary cusp (see Fig. 47-23, *A*). This incision is carried far enough into the two ventricles to gain access below (or upstream to) the tunnel stenosis. The newly created and enlarged anulus is sized, and an appropriately sized mechanical valve prosthesis is chosen. A double-velour collagen or gel-coated polyester graft is fashioned to form an oval-shaped patch. Beginning at the inferior angle of the incision in the ventricular septum, this patch is sewn into place from the RV side out to beyond the aortic anulus and posteriorly through it. A triangular patch of polyester is attached to the primary aortic patch with the anteriorly placed valve stitches (Fig. 47-23, *B*). Horizontal mattress sutures in the anterior aspect of the prosthesis are passed through the patch. The remainder of the polyester patch is sutured into place to enlarge and close the aortotomy (Fig. 47-23, *C*).

The triangular polyester patch is used to close the RV opening (see Fig. 47-23, *C*). The patch must be wide enough to enlarge the RV outflow tract as compensation for projection of the enlarged LV outflow tract into the RV outflow tract. Particular care is taken to anchor the patch at the junction of RV and aorta so that hemostasis is secure in that area.

The left atrial suction device is removed from across the foramen ovale. The foramen is closed, then the right atrium. The remainder of the operation is carried out in the usual manner (see "Completing Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2).

#### Aortoventriculoplasty by "Mini" Aortic Root Replacement

Enlarging the subvalvar and valvar area of the LV outflow tract can also be accomplished using biological material, either an ascending aorta valved allograft or a pulmonary artery valved autograft.C13,C14 The operation is begun in the same manner as the Konno operation, extending the incision into the ventricular septum as far toward the apex as required by the extent of subaortic stenosis; incision into the aorta is kept as short as possible. The aorta is then transected just downstream to the distal extent of the vertical incision, and the coronary ostia with generous buttons of surrounding sinus wall are removed from the aorta. The remnant of aortic root and valve cusps are then excised, leaving a fringe of aortic wall attached to the LV-aortic junction. The V-shaped defect in the ventricular septum is filled in with a polyester patch. This reconstructs and enlarges that portion of the LV outflow tract to which the aortic valved allograft (or pulmonary valved autograft) is attached proximally. The graft is sewn into place, and the coronary buttons are implanted. Finally, the opening in the anterior RV wall is closed with a patch, using a triangular piece of pericardium sutured into the incision and distally onto the anterior aspect of the graft.

The anterior mitral leaflet may be left in place on an aortic valved allograft and used to fill in the ventricular septum. However, this dictates the orientation of the valved cylinder, which may be disadvantageous because the curvature of the aorta is brought anteriorly and to the right. This problem can be overcome by using an aortic allograft with attached anterior mitral leaflet to widen the LV outflow tract posteriorly into the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve, as suggested by Milsom and Doty.M22 This places the allograft in anatomic position for treating the complex but localized subvalvar aortic stenosis.

#### Modified Konno Operation

The modified Konno operation, originally described in the first edition of this book, is effective in patients with difficult and complex localized subaortic stenosis or tunnel stenosis when the aortic anulus and valve are normal. This procedure has also been found to be useful in other patients.C19,D5

Preparations for operation and establishment of CPB are exactly as described for the Konno operation (see "Repair of Tunnel Stenosis by Aortoventriculoplasty [Konno Operation]" earlier in this section). The aorta is occluded, cold cardioplegic solution infused, and a suction device placed across the foramen ovale (see "Cold Cardioplegia, Controlled Aortic Root Reperfusion, and [When Needed] Warm Cardioplegic Induction" in Chapter 3). Because the Konno operation usually would not be done with a normal-sized anulus and valve, a transverse aortotomy is made just as for the operation for aortic valvotomy (see Section I of this chapter) or resection of discrete subaortic stenosis as described earlier in this section (Fig. 47-24, *A*). When it has been determined that the usual procedures will not enlarge the LV outflow tract sufficiently, the RV is opened through a transverse incision about 2 cm inferior (upstream) to the level of the pulmonary valve cusps. A right-angled clamp is passed

**Figure 47-23** Aortoventriculoplasty (Konno operation) and aortic valve replacement. **A,** Vertical aortotomy is directed slightly rightward of the commissure between left and right coronary cusps of aortic valve. As incision is being made, orifice of right coronary artery is visualized, and incision passes clearly leftward of this. Right ventricle (RV) is opened with an oblique incision, pulmonary valve is located, and the two incisions are joined. Before or after excising aortic valve, an incision is made into base of the right coronary cusp just to the left of its nadir. This incision is extended into ventricular septum and toward apex of left ventricle. It is leftward of conduction system. **B,** Patch of collagen-coated polyester is cut into a diamond shape and attached to ventricular septum. A second triangular-shaped patch is fashioned for closing RV outflow tract. This patch and a prosthetic valve are attached to the primary patch at the level of the aortic anulus. A single suture line will suffice for this portion of the reconstruction. Prosthetic valve is attached directly to aortic anulus.

from the aortotomy through the aortic valve and into the left side of the LV outflow tract and positioned 1 cm or so upstream to the valve. The tip of the clamp can be palpated through the ventricular septum, and at that point an incision is made in the septum from the RV side (Fig. 47-24, *B*). It is extended inferiorly for about 1 cm, parallel to the LV outflow tract and thus at an angle to the RV outflow tract. The incision through the ventricular septum is now extended superiorly with great care to keep it clearly upstream to the aortic valve (Fig. 47-24, *C*). Hypertrophied myocardium of the ventricular septum is removed to thin it out and relieve obstruction. As described for the Konno operation, an oval patch is trimmed from a double-velour collagen-coated polyester graft. This is sewn into place so as to enlarge the LV outflow tract (Fig. 47-24, *D*). The right ventriculotomy and aortotomy are closed with continuous sutures (Fig. 47-24, *E*).

## Valve-Preserving Technique for Enlarging Left Ventricular Outflow Tract and Mitral Anulus

Jonas and colleagues have described an operation for enlarging the LV outflow tract and mitral anulus in patients with tunnel subaortic stenosis, often as a component of Shone syndrome and therefore associated with mitral stenosis and hypoplasia of the mitral anulus.J4 The aortic valve, if normal, is preserved. The operation consists of an incision from the aorta through the commissure between the left and noncoronary cusps of the aortic valve. The incision is extended into the roof of the left atrium and across the anulus of the mitral valve. The mitral valve is removed and replaced with a mechanical prosthesis. A triangular patch is used to enlarge the mitral anulus and close the left atrium. The aorta is reclosed, preserving the aortic valve. Some regurgitation of the aortic valve may occur, but this is not necessarily negative, because it serves to hasten growth of the aortic anulus.

## RESULTS

#### Early (Hospital) Death

Hospital mortality for repair of *localized* subvalvar aortic stenosis is low but has not quite approached zero. In a combined series of 314 patients compiled from the literature, with operation performed primarily in an earlier era, mortality was 4.8% (CL 3.5%-6.4%).B7,C5,C9,C18,H3,K5,K12,L13,M13,N4,R7,S18

Extensive operations, such as aortoventriculoplasty by the Konno or Rastan technique, have a higher mortality.S3 In older children and young adults, aortoventriculoplasty has been performed with hospital mortalities of 5% to 15%.B12,D9,M23,R1

Although experience is limited, results for the Ross-Konno procedure have been good. Reddy and colleagues, Daenen and colleagues, and Brown and colleagues all report mortalities under 10% for series of 11 to 14 patients.B26,D1,R5 The operation can be successfully accomplished even in neonates.C1,V2

#### Time-Related Survival

About 85% to 95% of heterogeneous groups of children and young adults coming to operation for discrete subvalvar aortic stenosis are alive 15 years later.A6,B23,M31,N6,S7 Early and late deaths are virtually all related to residual LV outflow tract obstruction or subsequent efforts to relieve it, except for the few patients who die with infective endocarditis.

## Incremental Risk Factors for Premature Death

Absence of formal multivariable analysis of a sizable and representative group of patients undergoing appropriate surgical treatment handicaps the effort to identify incremental risk factors in patients with subvalvar aortic stenosis.

However, the *nature of the morphology* is clearly the dominant risk factor. The tunnel form of subvalvar aortic stenosis

![](_page_25_Figure_2.jpeg)

and small aortic anulus increase the risk of premature death. Increased risk in the early hazard phase after operation is related to more extensive operations required for optimal therapy. Increase in the later hazard phase is related to the tendency of patients with these complex morphologies to have persistent stenosis or develop restenosis that requires complex reoperations.

Morphologic risk factors can be eliminated by using an appropriate but extensive surgical procedure as the initial operation and by making it safe and durable by optimal myocardial management and improved techniques.

## Complications

Complications of the resection procedure are rare with current techniques, but include complete heart block, iatrogenic VSD, hemorrhage, and injury to the mitral valve. Reddy and colleagues reported that 1 of 11 patients (9%; CL 1.5%-28%) required a permanent pacemaker after aortoventriculoplasty.R5

## Functional Status

Functional status of surviving patients is generally good.B11 Of 38 surviving and traced patients in the UAB experience, 31 (82%; CL 73%-88%) were in NYHA functional class I and six (16%; CL 6%-24%) in NYHA class II. Whitmer and colleagues have shown objective evidence of improved exercise tolerance.W7

#### Hemodynamic Status

Most patients, including those with the less severe forms of tunnel stenosis, have an excellent hemodynamic result late (10 years) postoperatively. The operation usually results in a dramatic immediate gradient reduction, which is sustained or improved over the subsequent 10 years. In a few patients, gradient is mildly increased 5 to 10 years postoperatively compared with measurements in the operating room, but these data are difficult to interpret because of the variability of postrepair operating room measurements.

Sreeram and colleagues suggested that intraoperative echocardiography provides better morphologic information about obstructive lesions of the LV outflow tract and enables immediate assessment of the adequacy of operative repair.S19 Kuralay and colleagues suggested that use of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography in adult patients allows optimal resection of the obstruction and reduces complications such as complete heart block and VSD.K18 Results from simple resection are less good in patients with severe tunnel stenosis.M31 Wright and colleagues found that in six patients, mean LV-aortic gradient was reduced from 102 to 72 mmHg.W11 This was a smaller reduction in gradient (30 ± 17 mmHg) than was achieved in patients with discrete subvalvar aortic stenosis (52 ± 40 mmHg) (*P* for difference < .05). The advantages of the Konno or modified Konno procedure in this setting are clear.

## Recurrence and Reoperation

Stewart and colleagues found that about half of their patients having operations for localized and diffuse forms of subvalvar aortic stenosis required reoperation, some as long as 17 years after the initial procedure.S27 The hazard function for reoperation increased at 5 years. Serraf and colleagues analyzed longterm results including risk factors for recurrence and reoperation in 160 patients followed for a median of 13.3 years.S7 Freedom from reoperation at 15 years was 85%. Recurrence and reoperation were most influenced by coarctation of the aorta and immediate postoperative LV outflow tract gradient.

Brauner and colleagues followed 75 patients an average of 6.7 years after operation for subvalvar aortic stenosis.B17 They found 18 recurrences in 15 patients (20%). The linearized hazard of recurrence and reoperation was 3.8% per patient-year. When patients had a preoperative LV outflow tract gradient greater than 40 mmHg, risk of reoperation was sevenfold higher, suggesting that early intervention or more extensive operation may prevent recurrence, reoperation, and secondary progressive aortic valve disease. In discussing these findings, Freedom conjectured that the problem of recurrence may be more complex and somehow related to abnormal cellular response in the LV outflow tract.F7 Recalling earlier work of Ferrans and colleagues in which at least five cell layers are present in resected subvalvar fibrous rings, Freedom called for better understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of mechanical stress and genetic regulation of the endothelial surface of the LV outflow tract in subvalvar aortic stenosis.F7,F4

Recurrent discrete subvalvar stenosis is usually indistinguishable morphologically from the primary disease, although its recurrent rather than persistent nature has been documented.A6 This entity of recurrent discrete subvalvar stenosis is to be clearly distinguished from persistent subvalvar stenosis after an inadequate initial operation, although their effect and treatment are the same.

#### Aortic Regurgitation

Some investigators have suggested that aortic regurgitation may progress after a satisfactory operation.C9 Typically, however, aortic regurgitation remains trivial or mild unless endocarditis occurs.H3,K12 Serraf and colleagues found that relief of subvalvar aortic stenosis improved the degree of aortic regurgitation in 86% of patients (CL 80%-91%) with preoperative aortic regurgitation.S7

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Because obstruction from localized congenital subvalvar aortic stenosis tends to progress rather rapidly, and because the propensity for sudden death when it becomes severe is presumably the same as in severe congenital valvar aortic stenosis, operation is advisable whenever the stenosis is moderate (LV-aortic gradient > 50 mmHg) or severe. When the stenosis is severe (gradient > 100 mmHg), operation without delay is indicated. Resection of the subvalvar obstruction is usually the initial procedure of choice.

When the diagnosis has been made but obstruction is mild (LV-aortic gradient less than 50 mmHg), reevaluation with echocardiography is indicated every 6 months because rapid progression can occur. However, some evidence indicates that intervention at an earlier age and at a lower gradient (30 mmHg) may improve late results, depending on the extent of relief of obstruction at the initial operation.P4,R9

When discrete subvalvar stenosis is long (tunnel stenosis), and perhaps particularly when it is recurrent, simple resection is usually not effective. In these circumstances, an initial modified Konno operation is indicated.

When there are multiple levels of LV outflow tract obstruction or major associated cardiac anomalies, the general indications previously described pertain, but each patient must be considered with respect to individual morphology and circumstances. The Ross-Konno aortoventriculoplasty is the most generally applicable procedure, because the autograft may grow, and if it does it is the preferred technique in young patients. Either the Konno procedure or the "mini" aortic root replacement may also be used.

## SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

## Type of Operation

Simple resection of a discrete subaortic membrane (or shelf) has been recommended by some as equivalent to membrane resection plus transaortic myectomy in terms of likelihood of restenosis.A5,M15,S26 However, Lupinetti and colleagues and Barkhordarian and colleaguesB2 found that adding septal myectomy to resection of discrete subvalvar aortic stenosis reduced the frequency of reoperation.L16

## Aortoseptal Approach for Tunnel Stenosis

The modified Konno procedure provides only a limited exposure of the subvalvar area. Vouhe and colleagues have used an "aortoseptal approach" similar to the Konno operation, but without the need to replace the aortic valve.V4,V5 A longitudinal incision in the aorta is carried obliquely down toward the top of the adjacent portions of right and left aortic cusps. A roughly transverse incision is made in the RV infundibulum, beginning at a point just over this. The aortic and RV incisions come together just over the top of the left anterior fibrous trigone. The aortic "anulus" is now divided through the trigone, going exactly between adjacent extremities of left and right cusps; this can be done without damaging the cusps. This incision is carried well into the ventricular septum, as in the Konno procedure, opening the LV outflow tract widely. After resecting obstructing tissue, the septal incision is closed, the left anterior fibrous trigone reconstructed, and the RV and aortic incisions closed. The authors also describe widening the LV outflow tract with a polyester patch in closing the septal incision, as in the modified Konno procedure. The aortic valve is replaced if it is part of the obstructing process or if it is regurgitant.

## Left Ventricular–Aortic Conduit

The LV-aortic conduit (apicoaortic conduit) operation has enjoyed some popularity in the past.B8,C22 Norwood and colleagues reported a hospital mortality of 22% (CL 8%-45%) with use of this technique in infants.N6 Complications both early and late postoperatively are common, and 4 (24%; CL 12%-39%) of 17 hospital survivors reported by Brown and colleagues required reoperation, as did 7 (78%; CL 55%-92%) of 9 hospital survivors reported by Di Donato and colleagues.B24,D10 Currently, few indications exist for the procedure in cases of congenital aortic stenosis. Cooley and colleagues revived interest in apicoaortic conduits with a report of its use in seven patients with complex LV outflow tract obstruction.C20 They used a transthoracic approach to avoid redo sternotomy and compromise to coronary arteries, the conduction system, and other valves. Two patients died of respiratory insufficiency (29%; CL 10%-55%). The others survived and were improved by operation.

## **Section III Congenital Supravalvar Aortic Stenosis**

## DEFINITION

Congenital supravalvar aortic stenosis is an obstruction caused by localized or diffuse narrowing of the aortic lumen commencing immediately above the aortic valve.

#### HISTORICAL NOTE

The first description of supravalvar aortic stenosis is attributed to Mencarelli in 1930.M16 It was seldom recognized, however, until Denie and Verheugt emphasized in 1958 that supravalvar stenosis could be differentiated from other varieties of aortic stenosis by retrograde arterial catheterization.D7 In 1959, Morrow and colleagues pointed out the usefulness of angiography in diagnosis.M30

In 1961, Williams, Barratt-Boyes, and Lowe described the association of supravalvar aortic stenosis with unusual "elfin" facies and mental retardation,W8 a syndrome that was soon confirmed by others.B9,F2 This constellation of signs and symptoms has since been referred to as *Williams syndrome* or *elfin facies syndrome*. In 1964, Beuren and colleagues reported 10 cases of this syndrome, all associated with multiple peripheral pulmonary artery stenoses.B10 Watson and Bourassa and Campeau had also noted this association a year earlier.B16,W3 The similarity between the facies of patients with supravalvar aortic stenosis and severe infantile hypercalcemia was noted in 1963 by Hooft and colleagues and Black and Bonham Carter.B13,H12 Garcia and colleagues reported the first patient with Williams syndrome and a documented history of infantile hypercalcemia.G3 The occurrence of a familial form of supravalvar stenosis without elfin facies was reported by Sissman and colleagues in 1959.S15 Nakanishi and colleagues reported supravalvular aortic stenosis in monozygotic twins without phenotypic features of Williams syndrome.N1

Successful operation for supravalvar stenosis using patch graft enlargement of the noncoronary sinus of Valsalva was reported by McGoon and colleagues in 1961,M14 the first patient being operated on in 1956. Before this publication, successful procedures using a similar technique had been performed.G13,S24,W8 In 1960, Hara and colleagues successfully performed an excision and end-to-end aortic anastomosis in a patient with supravalvar aortic stenosis,H2 as did Chard and Cartmill.C6 Hancock satisfactorily relieved the stenosis by excising the intimal ridge without patch enlargement.H1 Neither of these procedures is currently recommended.

Most surgeons have placed the patch into the noncoronary sinus of Valsalva,C24,D2,M14,S24 but in Williams and colleagues' original report, it was placed into the right sinus to relieve any narrowing between the right cusp and aortic wall.W8 Doty and colleagues recommended using a double-flanged patch that extends into both noncoronary and right sinuses, incising the stenosing ring at points 180 degrees apart. Resecting the remaining stenotic ring above the left coronary sinus may be performed to enhance the repair.D14,H4 Their report introduced the concept of more anatomic repair of the aortic root and led to a number of modifications of the classic operations for supravalvar aortic stenosis. Subsequent modification of their extended aortoplasty techniqueD13 employed incision in the left coronary sinus and repositioning of the commissure between left and right coronary cusps of the aortic valve to achieve a more anatomic repair. Steinberg and colleagues proposed a modification of extended aortoplasty in which an additional separate incision is made across the sinutubular junction into the left coronary sinus of Valsalva to the right of the left coronary ostium.S25 This incision is closed around an oval-shaped prosthetic patch, and the primary Y-shaped incision is closed with a pantaloon-shaped patch.

Brom introduced an even more symmetric aortoplasty, enlarging all three sinuses of Valsalva by a three-patch technique. The first patient was operated on using this method in 1978, but the technique was not published until 1988.B22 The aorta is transected distal to the obstruction and incisions made into each of the three sinuses. Pericardial patches are inserted into each of the aortic sinuses to relieve the obstruction while retaining normal geometric relationships of the aortic root.

Myers and Waldhausen and colleaguesM33 described a technique of repair that is symmetric and obviates need for prosthetic patch material. The aorta is divided distal to the obstruction, and incisions are made into each aortic sinus. Distally, three incisions are made in the ascending aorta corresponding to the position of the commissures of the aortic valve. The aorta is mobilized sufficiently to advance the ascending aorta into the incisions in the aortic root.

## MORPHOGENESIS AND MORPHOLOGY

## Supravalvar Stenosis

#### *Morphogenesis*

The vascular pathology of supravalvar aortic stenosis and Williams syndrome results from mutations involving the elastin gene on chromosome 7q11.23.K10,L12,T1 These mutations include intragenic deletions, translocations, and complete deletion of the elastin gene, suggesting that a quantitative reduction in elastin during vascular development is pathogenically important. Point mutations of the elastin gene (ELN) are especially important in supravalvar aortic stenosis. Stamm and colleagues found Williams syndrome in 61% of patients treated operatively for supravalvar aortic stenosis, and more recently the clinical diagnosis was supported by the chromosome 7q11.23 abnormality.S20,S21

#### *Morphology*

Stenosis may be localized or diffuse.P5 Most often the narrowing is *localized* to the supravalvar area of the aorta just above or at the most superior level of the attachments of the valve commissures.D7,W8 Narrowing of the aorta at this point is usually apparent externally; in association with some dilatation of the sinuses of Valsalva and absence of poststenotic dilatation, this produces an hourglass appearance. In addition, variable intimal thickening in the form of an internal shelf increases the stenosis and may obstruct or even close the ostium of the left main coronary artery (see "Coronary Arteries" later in this section).

Less often, the narrowing is *diffuse*, extending throughout the length of the ascending aorta and even beyond into the arch and into the origins of brachiocephalic arteries.N3

## Other Aortic Lesions

Supravalvar aortic stenosis should be considered a complex anomaly of the aortic root. Too often the surgeon focuses attention on only the defect at the sinus rim; narrowing and thickening of the sinus rim are fundamental to the morphology, but this defect involves more anomalies. Thickening of the aortic media and intimal hyperplasia reduces aortic circumference at the sinus rim. The morphologic process may not be circumferential but may involve only the sinus rim over one or two sinuses. The sinus of Valsalva beneath the thick and short sinus rim may be abnormal or hypoplastic. Ostia of the coronary arteries may be obstructed not only by the overhanging thick sinus rim, but also by an aortic cusp that becomes bound down or fused to the aorta at the sinus rim.

The aortic valve cusps are reported to be thickened in about 30% of patients with supravalvar aortic stenosis.D14 True valvar stenosis resulting from leaflet fusion is rare.R4 The aortic valves are actually involved in every case, because the relationships of the commissures are distorted as they are drawn close together by the shortened and thickened sinus rim. This distortion produces a characteristic buckling of the free edge of the aortic cusp. The free edge of the aortic cusp has normal length in most young patients. It buckles as it accommodates to the shortened space at the sinus rim. The buckled aortic cusps become part of the obstruction within a space too small to accommodate them properly. Thickening of the edges of the aortic cusps, however, is eventually produced by turbulent blood flow from stenosis at the sinus rim. The thickened valve cusps then become an even more important part of the stenosing process.

The aortic anulus may occasionally be hypoplastic.K9 Subvalvar stenosis of the LV outflow tract may also be part of this total deformity of the aortic root.D6,K9 McElhinney and colleagues focused attention on the fact that supravalvar aortic stenosis involves not only the supravalvar aorta but the entire aortic root in the 36 patients who were operated on consecutively over 6 years.M12 Procedures were required on the aortic valve in 39%, which agrees closely with the series reported by Delius and colleagues.D6 In that series, resection of the subvalvar LV outflow tract was performed in 11 patients, and two patients underwent procedures on the coronary arteries. Four patients had aortic root deformity so severe that the entire root was replaced with a pulmonary autograft (Ross procedure). The authors compared their series to six others and found similar high frequency of associated pathology and LV outflow tract procedures.

Bicuspid aortic valve is common (6 of 15 patients, 40% in the series of Delius and colleaguesD6).

#### Coronary Arteries

The aortic valve cusp free edges near the aortic wall may become adherent to the intimal shelf, producing stenosis at the entry into the sinus of Valsalva, thereby obstructing coronary flow. This is more common in the left sinusD7,P5,R4 but can occur in the right.W8 When extreme, the proliferative process of the intimal ridge may extend into and narrow or even obstruct the ostium of the left coronary sinus.M6,T3 Stamm and colleagues found partial adhesion of the leaflets to the stenosing ridge in 54% of patients with supravalvar aortic stenosis.S22 In 30%, the valve leaflets were thickened and less mobile than normal. The sinuses of Valsalva were enlarged in 75% of cases. Coronary angiography demonstrated evidence of coronary ostial stenosis in 45%. The authors concluded that the entire valvular apparatus is always affected in patients with supravalvar aortic stenosis.

In the absence of obstruction to inflow into the sinus of Valsalva or of ostial stenosis, the coronary arteries are exposed to a high pressure and show dilatation, tortuosity, medial hypertrophy,N3 and early onset of arteriosclerosis.

## Other Cardiac Anomalies

The most common associated anomaly consists of multiple stenoses in the peripheral pulmonary arteries,B10 which may be severe enough to produce right ventricular hypertension and hypertrophy. Pulmonary valve stenosis occurs infrequently.B16 Diffuse hypoplasia of the pulmonary trunk may be associated with diffuse hypoplasia of the aorta,M11,S4,S29 with both arteries showing marked wall thickening and fibromuscular dysplasia histologically in association with disorganization and replacement of the elastic tissue of the media. These patients usually give a familial history, and sudden death in infancy is common.

Less common anomalies include stenosis of the origins of subclavian and carotid and rarely other major systemic arteries, coarctation of the aorta (with or without patent ductus arteriosus), and VSD. Mitral regurgitation occurs rarely, although the mitral valve may be thickened and redundant.B4 The patient reported by Denie and Verheugt in 1958 had Marfan syndrome,D7 which has been noted subsequently in about 5% of patients with supravalvar aortic stenosis.P5

## CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

#### Symptoms

Symptoms rarely develop in infancy, but appear frequently in childhood, and may appear as late as the second or third decade. They are similar to those of other types of congenital aortic stenosis, although angina may occur more often because of early-onset coronary arteriosclerosis.

#### Signs

Auscultatory findings are similar to those of congenital valvar aortic stenosis, and the correct diagnosis may not be possible from physical signs. An ejection click is absent, however, and the murmur and thrill tend to be situated higher than in valvar stenosis. An aortic diastolic murmur is uncommon.L15 Blood pressure may be lower in the left arm than in the right,C24,K9,W8 resulting from stenosis at the origin of the left subclavian artery or from a jet effect.F11,G11 Similarly, the left carotid pulse may be diminished.L15

A diagnostic clinical feature may be elfin facies (Fig. 47-25), combined with reduced intelligence quotient and

![](_page_29_Picture_13.jpeg)

**Figure 47-25** Photograph of four children with elfin facies and supravalvar congenital aortic stenosis reported from GLH in 1961. Appearance is characterized by depressed nasal bridge with anteverted nares, thick lips, mandibular recession, short palpebral fissures, and medial eyebrow flare. Dental malocclusion is present. (From Williams and colleagues.W8)

failure to thrive.W8 These retarded children are characteristically small, friendly, and loquacious. Each component of the syndrome varies in severity, however, and the supravalvar stenosis may be mild or occasionally absent in patients with the typical facies.J6 The disease in this form is always sporadic and the facies identical to severe infantile hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia has been documented in less than 5% of these infants, although it is more common when the elfin facies is not present.M5 Less than half of patients with congenital supravalvar aortic stenosis have elfin facies and mental retardation. In the remainder without elfin facies, the disease may be sporadic or familial.

## Echocardiography

Diagnosis and definition of severity can be made with twodimensional echocardiography and color flow Doppler examination (Fig. 47-26).

## Cardiac Catheterization and Angiography

The site of pressure change can be localized on withdrawal of a catheter from LV to aorta. Morphology of the supravalvar stenosis can be outlined on angiography (Fig. 47-26, *C*, and Fig. 47-27), and coexisting anomalies can be identified (Fig. 47-28). For these last reasons, cardiac catheterization and angiocardiography are usually indicated.

Left coronary artery appears near stenosed sinus rim *(arrow).* **C,** Left ventriculogram and aortogram in long-axial position shows stenosis of aorta at sinus rim and close proximity of coronary arteries to the stenosing process.

## NATURAL HISTORY

The supravalvar form is the least common type of congenital aortic stenosis. Genders are equally affected.

In infants with elfin facies, mental retardation, and combined congenital supravalvar aortic stenosis and pulmonary stenoses of the diffuse variety, sudden death is common early in life.S29 Sudden death can occur in all age groups, presumably from severe LV outflow tract obstruction and coronary artery disease.

Progression of supravalvar aortic stenosis may be more rapid and severe than in congenital valvar aortic stenosis.G8,W9 Because the lesion is uncommon in adults, most untreated patients probably die before reaching adult life.P1 Death before adult life is particularly likely to occur in those with elfin facies, because they constitute only 11% of adults but 60% of children with the anomaly. Some of the children with elfin facies and the severe form of infantile hypercalcemia die from complications of hypercalcemia. However, a longitudinal study by Hickey and colleagues indicates a more favorable prognosis for children with moderate (mean LV outflow tract systolic gradient 30 mmHg) supravalvar aortic stenosis. Many such children, particularly those with Williams syndrome, show gradual regression of gradient without intervention.H10

Kitchiner and colleagues followed 81 patients with supravalvar aortic stenosis from 1 to 29 years (median 8.3 years); 40 patients (49%) had Williams syndrome, 19 (23%) had additional levels of LV outflow tract obstruction, and 47 (58%) had surgical intervention, 20% in the first year after diagnosis.K14 The data indicated that 88% of the patients would be operated on within 30 years. Predicted survival at 30 years after presentation was 66%.

## TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

#### Repair of Localized Type

#### *Classic Repair*

The external hourglass deformity of the aorta is usually less prominent than the internal narrowing caused by the thick ridge of the sinutubular junction (Fig. 47-29, *A*). The operation is begun exactly as described for the procedure of valvotomy for congenital valvar aortic stenosis in Section I of this chapter. After occluding the aorta and infusing cold cardioplegic solution, the aortotomy is made.

The aorta is opened above the valve and the incision carried into the noncoronary sinus of Valsalva. The aortic valve and subvalvar areas are examined to exclude obstruction at those levels. The intimal shelf is resected (Fig. 47-29, *B*), in part to ensure adequate inflow into the sinuses of Valsalva. A diamond-shaped patch of pericardium or collagen-coated knitted polyester or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is then incorporated into the incision with a running polypropylene suture (Fig. 47-29, *C*). The patch must be of sufficient size to enlarge the aortic diameter to normal. The remainder of the procedure is completed as usual (see "Completing Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2).

Pressure is measured in the LV and ascending aorta to determine whether there is any residual gradient across the repair. Intraoperative echocardiography with color flow Doppler examination should be done to assess the degree of turbulence over the repair and determine whether aortic valve regurgitation is present.

## *Extended Aortoplasty (Doty)*

The operation is performed on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) using a single two-stage venous uptake cannula, with oxygenated blood returned to a cannula in the ascending aorta (see "Preparation for Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2). The aorta is occluded and cold cardioplegia infused through a cannula in the coronary sinus (see "Technique of Retrograde Infusion" in Chapter 3). A vent catheter is placed in the right superior pulmonary vein.

An oblique incision is made in the aorta, extending it across the obstructing ridge at the sinutubular junction and into the middle of the noncoronary sinus. The primary incision is also extended to the left to cross the sinutubular junction into the right sinus of Valsalva just anterior to the commissure between the left and right coronary cusps of the aortic valve (Fig. 47-30, *A*). The incisions into the aortic root are nearly directly opposite each other at the sinutubular junction, allowing the aorta to be divided into almost equal portions. The anterior portion of the aortic root that contains the origin of the right coronary artery may move forward (anterior) to widen the space at the sinutubular junction. Buckling of the aortic valve leaflets is relieved as the halves of the aorta are separated anteriorly and posteriorly. The thick ridge of the supravalvar stenosis located above the left coronary sinus is excised (Fig. 47-30, *B*). A crimped tubular polyester graft whose diameter approximates that of the ascending aorta is used for reconstruction. About half of the circumference of the graft is used, and the length should be sufficient to place enough graft into the aortotomy to prevent the anterior portion of the aortic root from being pulled down into the plane of the aorta. A wedge is removed from the graft to accommodate the portion of the aorta containing the right coronary artery. The resulting two limbs of the graft are used to widen both the right and noncoronary sinuses of Valsalva (see Fig. 47-30, *B*) partially closing the aortotomy; the distal end of the graft fills the aortotomy in the ascending aorta.

Entrapment of the left coronary cusp of the aortic valve may be treated not only by resection of the supravalvar thickened rim but also by incision into the left sinus of Valsalva to the left of the left coronary ostium (Fig. 47-30, *C*). This incision mobilizes the commissure between the left and the right coronary cusps and allows the commissure to be moved anteriorly for greater symmetry of the position of the three commissures. The pantaloon-shaped patch is attached to the adventitia of the aorta behind the commissure between the left and right cusps at the anular level. The commissure is attached directly to the patch to achieve equal distance between the three commissures at the sinus rim (see Fig. 47-30, *C*).

Although this operation represents a more symmetric form of repair of supravalvar aortic stenosis than the classic onepatch repair, accurate restoration of the dimensions at the sinutubular junction relative to the aortic anulus is difficult to accomplish.

#### *Three-Patch Repair (Brom)*

The operation is performed on CPB using a single two-stage venous uptake cannula and an arterial cannula in the ascending aorta (see "Preparation for Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2). The aorta is occluded and cold cardioplegia infused (see "Cold Cardioplegia, Controlled Aortic Root Reperfusion, and [When Needed] Warm Cardioplegic Induction" in Chapter 3).

The aorta is divided above the sinutubular junction. Three longitudinal incisions are made through the area of stenosis into the aortic root (Fig. 47-31, *A*). The first is placed in the middle of the noncoronary sinus of Valsalva. The other two are determined by position of the coronary arteries. Incision into the left coronary sinus is usually to the right of the left coronary ostium, and incision into the right sinus is usually to the left of the right coronary ostium. The incisions end about halfway into the sinus aorta, but may go deeper if necessary to achieve good separation of the edges of the aorta at the stenosing ridge. Three triangular patches of autologous pericardium are inserted (Fig. 47-31, *B*). Width of the patch at the sinutubular junction should restore correct dimensions. The diameter at the sinutubular junction should be 10% to 15% less than the diameter at the ventriculoaortic junction ("anulus"). Larger patches achieve a greater diameter but carry the risk of reducing the coaptation area of the aortic valve by lateral displacement of commissural attachments of the valve, possibly resulting in aortic regurgitation. The reconstructed aortic root is anastomosed to the ascending aorta.

## *Sliding Aortoplasty (Myers-Waldhausen)*

The operation is performed on CPB. The aorta is divided above the supravalvar obstruction. Three longitudinal incisions are made through the area of stenosis into the three sinuses of Valsalva as described for the "Three-Patch Repair (Brom)" in the preceding text. Three incisions are made into the ascending aorta distally and correspond exactly to the commissures of the aortic valve (Fig. 47-32, *A*). The ascending aorta is mobilized extensively to allow it to be displaced inferiorly so as to slide the flaps of the ascending aorta into the incisions in the aortic root in a "V-Y" pattern. A continuous stitch of monofilament suture is started at the nadir of each incision in the sinus aorta. The corresponding flap of ascending aorta is attached to the edges of the incision in the sinus aorta by sewing from the nadir to the top of the commissural attachment of the aortic valve (Fig. 47-32, *B*). The diameter of the aortic root at the sinutubular junction will be determined by the diameter of the ascending aorta and should approximate normal dimensions (see "Dimensions of Normal Cardiac and Great Artery Pathways" in Chapter 1). No prosthetic material is employed in this repair.

#### Repair of Diffuse Type

The operation proceeds as described for the localized type, except that the skin incision is carried about 2 cm more superiorly than usual. The femoral artery is exposed for arterial cannulation. Origins of the brachiocephalic, left common carotid, and left subclavian arteries and the transverse portion

**Figure 47-30** Repair of supravalvar aortic stenosis by extended aortoplasty (Doty). **A,** Oblique incision is made in aorta extending across supravalvar ridge into middle of noncoronary sinus of Valsalva. A second incision is made as an inverted "Y" into right sinus, just anterior to commissure between left and right coronary cusps. This divides the stenosing ring at two points almost directly opposite on circumference of ring. **B,** Supravalvar ridge is removed from above left coronary sinus of Valsalva. A patch is fashioned from a tubular polyester graft approximately the diameter of aorta. A wedge is removed to create two limbs on the patch and accommodate position of right coronary ostium (pantaloon patch). Patch is attached to edges of aortotomy in right and noncoronary sinuses of Valsalva and to primary incision in aorta. Sufficient length of graft must be placed into aortotomy to allow portion of aorta containing right coronary ostium to separate anteriorly from primary aortic incision.

of the aortic arch are dissected below and above the left brachiocephalic vein.

CPB is established with arterial inflow to the patient through the femoral artery, and body temperature is taken to 18°C. The operating table is placed with the patient in moderate Trendelenburg position. The aorta is occluded while cold cardioplegia is infused. Aortic reconstruction is done with hypothermic circulatory arrest (see Section IV of Chapter 2).

A longitudinal incision is made in the ascending aorta and carried well down into one or two sinuses of Valsalva, as in repair of the localized form. Any intimal ridge above each sinus of Valsalva is excised as described for the localized type. The incision is carried up the ascending aorta, which is usually thick walled and has a small lumen, and around onto the aortic arch, then if necessary into the upper descending thoracic aorta (Fig. 47-33, *A*). Incisions are made across any stenosis present at the origin of the brachiocephalic and left common carotid arteries, and intimal proliferations dissected away. Thickened interna and media is dissected away from the aortic adventitia by endarterectomy (Fig. 47-33, *B*). A patch of double-velour collagen-coated polyester or PTFE is

**C,** Greater symmetry of the repair may be accomplished by a third incision into left coronary sinus of Valsalva just posterior to commissure between right and left sinuses. This incision mobilizes the commissure so that it can move anteriorly to achieve better spacing between commissures of aortic valve and to achieve better configuration of left cusp. Pantaloon patch is attached to adventitia of aorta behind commissure at level of "anulus." Commissure is attached directly to inside of patch. **Figure 47-30, cont'd**

Width of patches at the top should restore correct dimensions of the sinutubular junction, or 10% to 15% less than the diameter of the ventriculoaortic junction ("anulus"). These patches are attached to aorta by continuous stitches of fine polypropylene suture. Ends of aorta are reanastomosed.

Three incisions are made in proximal aorta through the stenosing ring into sinuses of Valsalva (see Fig. 47-31). Three incisions are made into distal ascending aorta at points corresponding exactly to position of commissures of aortic valve. Ascending aorta is mobilized to allow it to be displaced inferiorly, sliding the flaps of ascending aorta into the incisions in aortic root in "V-Y" fashion. **B,** Continuous stitch of fine polypropylene suture is started at nadir of each incision in aortic root. Corresponding flap of ascending aorta is attached to edges of incision in aortic sinus by sewing from nadir to top of commissural attachment of aortic valve.

fashioned to an appropriate size and shape (Fig. 47-33, *C*). In young patients, an allograft of ascending aorta and arch can be used, as in the Norwood operation. Beginning distally, the patch is sutured into place with continuous 4-0 or 5-0 polypropylene. An ear or projection is fashioned into the patch to go across the orifices of the left common carotid and brachiocephalic arteries. Once the arch reconstruction suture lines are into the ascending aorta proximal to origin of the brachiocephalic artery, CPB is reestablished.

A right-angled cannula is inserted through a purse-string suture into the superior vena cava. The vena cava is occluded between the cannula and the right atrium, the cannula is attached to the arterial tubing, and retrograde cerebral perfusion is begun at about 25 mmHg pressure. When air and blood have been flushed out, perfusion through the systemic arterial cannula is reestablished, air is extruded from beneath the patch graft, and the clamp is repositioned on the ascending aorta just proximal to the brachiocephalic artery. Reconstruction of the ascending aorta is continued into the aortic root, attaching the patch to the edges of the aortotomy. Rewarming is accomplished during reconstruction of the ascending aorta and aortic root.

#### RESULTS

## Early (Hospital) Death

Primary repair of isolated *localized* congenital supravalvar aortic stenosis has a low hospital mortality. Early risks are greater in patients with *diffuse* congenital supravalvar aortic stenosis. Sharma and colleagues reported the total experience with operative treatment of supravalvar aortic stenosis at the Texas Heart Institute,S9 an experience that spanned 29 years and involved 73 patients. Twenty-four patients (32%) had isolated localized supravalvar aortic stenosis and were treated by patch aortoplasty. The results were good, with only one death (4%; CL 0.5%-13%).

## Time-Related Survival

Late survival is good. In analyses of 30 to 100 patients, 10-year survival after repair was 88% to 98%, with 20-year survival of 60% to 90%.B27,H8,S21 Late mortality is more common with complex forms of the anomaly.S9

#### Functional and Hemodynamic Status

Most patients are without symptoms.M17,S5 Results of treating supravalvar aortic stenosis indicate that pressure gradients from LV to aorta are largely relieved by classic patch aortoplasty for the localized form of the defect.K9,R4,W4 Keane and colleagues reported that pressure gradients remaining after that operation ranged from 4 to 55 mmHg (mean 27 mmHg).K9 Good long-term relief of pressure gradients were observed in the Mayo Clinic experience.R4 Pressure gradient measured intraoperatively after extended patch aortoplasty ranged from 0 to 35 mmHg.D14 Delius and colleagues reported results in the original cohort of 15 patients followed for 10 to 20 years after extended aortoplasty operation.D6 The mean immediate postoperative gradient was 20 mmHg (range 0-50 mmHg), and the long-term mean gradient was 32 mmHg (range 6-96 mmHg). A residual gradient is usually caused by overlooked coexisting valvar or subvalvar stenosis.R4

## Reoperation

Long-term follow-up data on recurrent or residual stenosis requiring reoperation are limited. Of Kitchiner and colleagues' experience with 81 patients followed 1 to 29 years (median 8.3 years), 47 had surgical intervention.K14 Of those surviving operation, 74% had trivial or mild stenosis at follow-up. Sharma and colleagues reported that 16 of their 73 patients required a second operation during the follow-up period that extended to 22 years.S9 Brown and colleagues reported that reoperation was required in 14% of 101 patients at a median follow-up of 9.4 years.B27

Freedom from reoperation was 69% at 11 years in the study of Delius and colleagues.D6 Bicuspid aortic valve was a risk factor for reoperation. These data suggest that operations for supravalvar aortic stenosis provide effective long-term relief of the pressure gradient over the sinus rim. The operations are only palliative, however, and many patients will eventually require other operations.

Two studies compare results among the various methods of operative treatment for supravalvar aortic stenosis. Hazekamp and colleagues compared the results of Brom's three-patch technique in 13 patients with 16 patients having other types of repair (14 classic, 1 extended aortoplasty, 1 two-patch repair) for supravalvar aortic stenosis.H8 No differences in outcome could be demonstrated among the various techniques. All decreased aortic gradient. Mean pressure gradient was less than 10 mmHg in all but four patients, two of whom had the diffuse form of supravalvar aortic stenosis. Two patients required later aortic valve replacement at 2 and 16 years after the initial operation. Stamm and colleagues reviewed 41 years of surgical experience with congenital supravalvar aortic stenosis in 75 patients.S21 A single patch in the noncoronary sinus was used in 34 patients, an extended aortoplasty to two sinuses of Valsalva in 35 patients, and three-sinus reconstruction in six patients. Multiple-sinus reconstructions (two or three) resulted in superior hemodynamics (lower gradients) and were associated with fewer reoperations (*P* = .007).S21 The only independent risk factor for reoperation was type of operation (*P* < .001): risk was higher when a single sinus repair was used (approximately 50% by 15 years) compared with two-sinus repair (approximately 15% by 15 years). Similar findings in support of multisinus aortoplasty were reported by Kaushal and colleagues.K6

No long-term data are available for the sliding aortoplasty, but the method may retain more of the elastic properties of the aortic root than other repair methods. However, this technique is not suitable for patients with diffuse disease.S6

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Operation is advisable in patients with localized or diffuse congenital supravalvar aortic stenosis when peak pressure gradient across the stenosis is 50 mmHg or more. Because of the progressive nature of supravalvar stenosis, operation should be performed without delay at whatever age the criteria for surgery are met.

It can be inferred from the experience reported by Sharma and colleagues that about one third of patients have a simple anomaly that can be treated with a simple operation.S9 However, nearly half (45% in Sharma and colleagues' experience) have a localized form of supravalvar aortic stenosis plus another obstructive lesion of the LV outflow tract that requires patch aortoplasty plus aortic valvotomy, aortic valve replacement, or subvalvar resection. Therefore, about half of patients with supravalvar aortic stenosis classified as having only localized lesions actually have a complex LV outflow tract anomaly.

Patients with a diffuse form of the defect or with associated cardiac anomalies or infection do less well, with results commensurate with severity and complexity of the defects. Therefore, coexisting diffuse right and left pulmonary arterial stenoses should probably not be approached surgically, because the stenoses usually extend into branches. The possibility of their improvement by percutaneous balloon dilatationD12 and the tendency for their physiologic effect to decrease as patients age indicate that, in general, their presence should not be a contraindication to surgical relief of supravalvar aortic stenosis.

## SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

## Choice of Patch Material

Inserting a patch of prosthetic material or pericardium to enlarge the aortic diameter, combined with resection of the intimal shelf, is a safe and effective procedure.M14,R4 Theoretically, a false aneurysm may develop at the edge of a polyester onlay patch, similar to when a polyester patch is used in repair of coarctation (see "Late Aneurysm Formation" in Section I of Chapter 48). Polyester graft may also stimulate overgrowth of fibrous tissue (pannus). Pericardium is a more desirable material but might be constrictive, although it does not seem to constrict when applied in the aorta. Tanning with a short exposure to glutaraldehyde may reduce the tendency of pericardium to constrict and makes handling easier during the repair. Glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine pericardium may also have a place in this repair if autologous pericardium is not available. PTFE graft may also be useful.

Al-Halees and colleagues reported using autologous pulmonary artery for the patch in an extended aortoplasty.A1 The pulmonary trunk above the valve and below the bifurcation was removed and fashioned to provide a pantaloon-shaped patch for reconstructing two aortic sinuses and extending the aorta after resecting the obstructing rim. They suggested that this patch material would grow with the patient.
