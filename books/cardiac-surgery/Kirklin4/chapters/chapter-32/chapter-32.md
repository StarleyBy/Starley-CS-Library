#### DEFINITION

Classic (or typical) cor triatriatum, or *cor triatriatum sinister,* is a rare congenital cardiac anomaly in which the pulmonary veins typically enter a "proximal" left atrial chamber separated from the "distal" left atrial chamber by a partition in which there are one or more restrictive ostia.1 In the Congenital Heart Surgery Nomenclature and Database Project, cor triatriatum is classified as a pulmonary venous anomaly, with subclassifications as described in Box 32-1.

## HISTORICAL NOTE

Cor triatriatum was apparently first described in 1868 by Church.C2 The name *cor triatriatum* was applied to the malformation by Borst in 1905.B3 The angiographic diagnosis seems first to have been made at Mayo Clinic and described by Miller and colleagues in 1964.M3 Echocardiographic diagnosis of this cardiac anomaly was described by Ostman-Smith and colleagues in 1984 and by Wolf in 1986.O3,W2 The first surgical correction is believed to have been performed by Vineberg and Gialloreto in 1956; the second by Lewis and colleagues followed shortly thereafter.L1,V5

## MORPHOLOGY

It is unfortunate that cor triatriatum was first defined as "an abnormal septum in the left auricle"C2 and has been described as resulting in a "subdivided left atrium,"R1,T1 because these terms obscure surgically important concepts about cor triatriatum.

# Morphology of Classic Cor Triatriatum

Typically, the proximal (common pulmonary venous) chamber is somewhat larger than the distal (left atrial) chamber. The common wall partitioning them ("diaphragm" or "membrane"), which may have one or more openings (apertures), is usually thick and fibromuscular (Fig. 32-1). The aperture is typically two dimensional, meaning it has no length, but occasionally it is three dimensional, exhibiting a tubular or tunnel-like configuration.M1,R1

The proximal chamber contains all pulmonary vein connections and is usually thick-walled, whereas the distal chamber always contains the left atrial appendage, leads into the mitral valve, and is thin-walled (Fig. 32-2). Despite high pressure in the proximal chamber, the pulmonary veins are not dilated. Entry of the right pulmonary veins into the proximal chamber usually bears the same relationship to the right atrium and superior vena cava as in the normal heart (Fig. 32-3).

The right ventricle is usually enlarged, but this enlargement depends on the presence and degree of left-to-right shunting at the atrial level. The left ventricle is usually normal in size or small. The fossa ovalis may be in the septum between the proximal chamber and right atrium, but occasionally it is in the septum between the distal chamber and right atrium.N1 The foramen ovale is usually patent and stretched.

## Relationship of Cor Triatriatum to Partial and Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection

In classic cor triatriatum, the right and left pulmonary veins can be considered as not joining the left atrium but rather as entering a chamber, generally posterior and a little superior or medial to the left atrium, that is analogous to the common pulmonary venous sinus found in many patients with total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC; see

*Cor triatriatum dexter* is a term used to describe the partially divided right atrium present in some cardiac malformations. This condition is considered in the chapter on tricuspid atresia (see Morphology in Chapter 41) and is unrelated to cor triatriatum sinister.

Chapter 31). Indeed, Van Praagh and Corsini did not use the term *proximal left atrial chamber,* but called it the *common pulmonary vein chamber of cor triatriatum*. V2 Marin-Garcia and colleagues used similar terminology.M1

From an embryologic standpoint, the confluence of the pulmonary veins is completely incorporated into the left atrium in a normal heart, is not incorporated into the left atrium in TAPVC, and is partially incorporated into the left atrium in cor triatriatum. Just as TAPVC does not always involve all pulmonary veins connecting to a single pulmonary venous sinus (i.e., mixed TAPVC), cor triatriatum does not always involve all pulmonary veins draining to the proximal chamber. There are several examples of cor triatriatum in which some of the pulmonary veins drain to the

proximal chamber, and the remainder have classic anomalous drainage.

Partial anomalous left pulmonary venous connection (from left upper lobe only or from entire left lung) may connect to a left vertical vein that connects to the left brachiocephalic vein, with all other pulmonary veins entering the proximal chamber.R1,S3,V2 Partial anomalous venous connection may consist of all left pulmonary veins connecting to the coronary sinus, with the proximal chamber receiving only the right pulmonary veins and connecting through the usual small orifice into the distal left atrial chamber.G1 Comparisons to partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection (PAPVC) also exist. In these examples, some pulmonary veins connect to the proximal chamber, and the remainder connect normally to the left atrium.

In "partial" cor triatriatum, the right pulmonary veins alone may connect to the proximal chamber, with the left pulmonary veins connecting normally to the left atrium.T1 Other unusual variants have been documented. The proximal chamber, receiving all pulmonary veins, may have an imperforate portion between it and a typical distal chamber and instead connect to the *right* atrium, whereas the right and left atria are in communication through a coronary sinus atrial septal defect, with the coronary sinus itself being completely unroofed (see Chapter 33). In another example, all pulmonary veins may fail to join an otherwise typical proximal chamber separated from the distal chamber by a perforated partition, and instead connect to a common pulmonary venous sinus behind the heart that may connect to the coronary sinus, superior vena cava, or infradiaphragmatically.K3,V6

# Relationship of Cor Triatriatum to a Left Superior Vena Cava

A left superior vena cava coexists with cor triatriatum considerably more frequently than with other types of congenital heart disease.A5,G1,O2 One proposed pathogenesis of cor triatriatum is impingement of a left superior vena cava on the developing left atrium.G2 Ascuitto and colleagues reported cases in which a persistent left superior vena cava joining a dilated coronary sinus impinged on the posterior wall of the left atrium and divided it into two chambers, both of which had defects that communicated with the right atrium.A6 It seems clear that a relationship exists between these two anomalies, at least in some patients.

# Associated Anomalies

In addition to PAPVC and unroofed coronary sinus with a left superior vena cava joining the left atrium, other associated anomalies include ventricular septal defect, coarctation of the aorta, atrioventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, and (rarely) asplenia and polysplenia.M1

## CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

Infants with classic cor triatriatum, with a small aperture between the proximal and distal chambers, usually present with evidence of low cardiac output, including pallor, tachypnea, poor peripheral pulses, and growth failure.W1 When there is associated left-to-right shunting due to connection of the proximal chamber to the right atrium or because of associated PAPVC, evidence of pulmonary overcirculation and venous obstruction may be present in the chest radiograph, and right ventricular enlargement is prominent. In children and young adults, the classic presentation is with signs and symptoms of pulmonary venous hypertension. However, like mitral stenosis, cor triatriatum may present with less classic symptoms.S3

Diagnosis is usually made by echocardiographyM5,S2 (Fig. 32-4). Transesophageal echocardiography has also proven useful in selected cases.M4 Recently, three-dimensional echocardiography has been used to identify complex morphology in cor triatriatum.A5,B1 Magnetic resonance imaging with three-dimensional reconstruction provides excellent

delineation of both simple and complex morphology in cor triatriatum and is the imaging study of choice if standard two-dimensional echocardiography is not definitive.L2 Cardiac catheterization and cineangiographic studies are no longer considered necessary unless major associated cardiac anomalies are suspected. However, further evidence may be obtained from selective cineangiographic studies and pressure measurements in the proximal and distal chambers. If the catheter cannot be manipulated into the proximal and distal chambers from the right atrium, sometimes an arterial catheter can be advanced into the left ventricle and retrogradely across the mitral valve and into the distal and then proximal chamber.V1 Gradients of 20 to 25 mmHg have been demonstrated between the two chambers.V1

#### NATURAL HISTORY

Natural history depends on the effective size of the aperture in the partition between the proximal and distal chambers. When it is small, the infant becomes critically ill during the early months of life, with signs of pulmonary venous obstruction (Fig. 32-5, *A*). Without surgical treatment, such patients die at that young age.J1,O1,P1,W1 If the aperture is larger, the patient presents in childhood or young adulthood with the signs, symptoms, and prognosis of mitral stenosis.B2

In most patients, the aperture is severely restrictive, and approximately 75% of persons born with classic cor triatriatum die in infancy. However, when the proximal chamber communicates with the right atrium through a fossa ovalis atrial septal defect, the prognosis is better because the proximal chamber decompresses into the right atrium (Fig. 32-5, *B*). These patients present with signs of a large left-to-right shunt and generally survive longer than those with an obstructive aperture. Rarely, cor triatriatum may be discovered in an adult.A2,M1,M2,M3 Delay in diagnosis may be accounted for by a lesser degree of obstruction by the partition or by a unilateral pulmonary venous obstruction.K1

# TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

## Classic Cor Triatriatum

Treatment of cor triatriatum is primarily by operation. In small infants, approach through the right atrium is preferable. In older patients, especially when the proximal chamber is

![](_page_4_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 32-5** Morphology of cor triatriatum. **A,** Cor triatriatum with patent foramen ovale below obstructing partition. Proximal chamber is separated from distal chamber by an obstructing partition. Partition is attached to the atrial septum medially and immediately below left inferior pulmonary vein laterally. The lateral attachment is also closely related to the mitral valve. Left atrial appendage is in the distal chamber. Clinical presentation is that of pulmonary venous obstruction (like mitral valve stenosis) when the aperture in the partition is small. Distal chamber communicates with right atrium through foramen ovale, but left-to-right shunt is small. **B,** Cor triatriatum with patent foramen ovale above obstructing partition, through which the proximal chamber may communicate with the right atrium. Clinical presentation in this situation is that of a large left-to-right shunt or may mimic total anomalous pulmonary venous connection. Right ventricle may be enlarged.

enlarged and no other cardiac anomalies exist, approach through an incision in the right side of this chamber is recommended.

After usual preparations, moderately hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) using two venous cannulae is established (see Section III of Chapter 2). Alternatively, hypothermic circulatory arrest may be employed according to surgeon preference. Cold cardioplegia is established as usual after clamping the aorta (see "Cold Cardioplegia, Controlled Aortic Root Reperfusion, and [When Needed] Warm Cardioplegic Induction" in Chapter 3).

When the approach is through the proximal chamber, a vertical incision is made in the chamber anterior to the right pulmonary veins (Fig. 32-6, *A*) exactly as for mitral valve surgery (see Technique of Operation in Chapter 11). After insertion of an appropriately sized Richardson retractor or similar instrument, the diaphragm is exposed and apertures in it identified. A preliminary incision out from the apertures improves exposure for the definitive excision (Fig. 32-6, *B*). Orifices of the pulmonary veins on both sides are located. Position of the atrial septum is also identified, if necessary, by opening the right atrium and inserting a curved clamp to displace the atrial septum into either the distal or proximal chamber. Most of the partition between these chambers is then excised to make as large an opening as possible (Fig. 32-6, *C*). This procedure is usually easily and quickly done.

When an approach through the right atrium is used, its free wall is incised as in atrial septal defect closure. The right side of the atrial septum is examined and the fossa ovalis identified. If a foramen ovale or atrial septal defect is present, this is enlarged by incision to gain access into the left-sided chamber with which it communicates, either proximal or distal. If there is no atrial septal defect, the septum primum within the fossa ovalis is incised. The partition between the proximal and distal chambers is then identified. In Fig. 32-7, the exposure provided by an atrial septal incision leading into the proximal chamber is shown (Fig. 32-7, *A*). The partition is easy to identify and expose by this approach (Fig. 32-7, *B*). The procedure described for the left-side approach is carried out and the opening in the atrial septum closed with a pericardial patch (Fig. 32-7, *C*). The cardiotomy is closed, the heart having been filled with blood or saline solution before the last few sutures were placed. The remainder of the operation is completed in the usual fashion (see "Completing Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2).

In the rare case in which there is a specific contraindication to CPB, percutaneous balloon dilatation is possible using a double balloon technique similar to that proposed for mitral valve stenosis.K2 Relief of symptoms is good, but follow-up is too short (3 months) to establish confidence in this treatment.

#### Atypical Cor Triatriatum

As noted earlier under Morphology, patients occasionally present for treatment with atypical forms of cor triatriatum, or other important cardiac anomalies may coexist. A persistent left superior vena cava may be present, connecting to the coronary sinus or directly to the upper left atrium, with "unroofing" of the coronary sinus.V3 Because almost any number of specific combinations may be encountered, the general surgical approach is described rather than a detailed description of each possible combination.

Before operation, the surgeon must determine with reasonable certainty the connections and drainage of all pulmonary and systemic veins, including the possible presence and connection of a left superior vena cava. The possible presence

of both a confluence of all (or some of) the pulmonary veins behind the heart *and* a proximal left atrial chamber should be investigated. The possible connections, through apertures in the wall, of the proximal chambers with both the distal chamber *and* right atrium are determined. Initially, the largest "atrial" chamber appearing on the right side of the heart should be opened. If this is not the right atrium, the right atrium often should be opened subsequently to complete a thorough examination of the morphologic details, all of which must be verified at operation. The repair itself is usually some combination of the repair of typical cor triatriatum, PAPVC and TAPVC (see Technique of Operation in Chapters 30 and 31), and unroofed coronary sinus syndrome (see Chapter 33).

Hospital deaths are uncommon after repair of *classic* cor triatriatum. Those that occur are in critically ill infants and should be considered to be related to inadequate myocardial management.R2 Seven separate single-institution retrospective studies constitute a combined total of 96 surgical cases of classic cor triatriatum with six early deaths (6.2%; CL 4.1%-9.4%)A3,A4,C1,G3,R2,S1,V4 (Table 32-1).

Atypical cor triatriatum can also be successfully repaired. Many of the studies documented in Table 32-1 report successful repairs in patients in this more complex subset but also emphasize that mortality is higher than for classic cor triatriatum.

Standard cardiopulmonary bypass, two venous uptake cannulae, and caval tourniquets are usually employed, although a short period of hypothermic circulatory arrest may provide the best exposure in a neonate or small infant. Foramen ovale (atrial septal defect) is enlarged by excision of atrial septum to provide access to proximal and distal chambers. **B,** Obstructing partition is seen as atrial septum is excised. A retractor placed anteriorly on the septum provides exposure for identifying the left inferior pulmonary vein and mitral valve. **C,** Obstructing partition is completely excised.

survival was 96% at 5 years and 88% at 15 years. The association of pulmonary vein stenosis with cor triatriatum reinforces the interrelationship between cor triatriatum and TAPVC (see "Pulmonary Vein Stenosis" under Reoperation and the Development of Pulmonary Venous Obstruction in Chapter 31). Another unfavorable late event is restenosis of the orifice between the proximal chamber and left atrium.J1 This may be the result of an inadequate original operation in which the common wall between the two chambers was incompletely resected. Most follow-up studies suggest that essentially all patients are either described as asymptomatic or are documented to be in New York Heart Association functional class I.A1,A4,R2,S1

## INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Classic cor triatriatum with a restrictive aperture in the partition between the proximal and distal chambers is an urgent indication for operation, because 75% of patients with such malformations die in infancy. When older patients present with chronic symptoms, operation is also urgently indicated.

In atypical cor triatriatum, when the proximal chamber opens into the right atrium, a restrictive opening or no opening is present between the proximal and distal chambers, and only a small patent foramen ovale exists between the right atrium and distal chamber, physiologic instability will be present. A large left-to-right shunt combined with restricted left atrial and left ventricular inflow produces severe symptoms during the early months of life, and operation is urgently indicated.
