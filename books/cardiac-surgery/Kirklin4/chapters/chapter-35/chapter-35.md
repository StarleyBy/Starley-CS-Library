### **Section I Primary Ventricular Septal Defect**

#### DEFINITION

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a hole or multiple holes in the interventricular septum. This chapter discusses VSDs that occur as the primary lesion, recognizing that hearts with primary VSDs may have minor coexisting morphologic abnormalities.O9

VSD may be part of another major cardiovascular anomaly, such as tetralogy of Fallot (see Chapter 38), complete atrioventricular (AV) septal defect (see Chapter 34), anatomically corrected malposition of the great arteries (see Chapter 57), truncus arteriosus (see Chapter 43), tricuspid atresia (see Chapter 41), sinus of Valsalva aneurysm (see Chapter 36), and interrupted aortic arch (see Chapter 48). VSDs also may be acquired, as discussed in Chapters 9 and 17.

#### HISTORICAL NOTE

In 1954, Lillehei, Varco, and colleagues at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis began to repair VSDs using normothermic, low-flow, controlled cross-circulation based on the so-called azygos flow principle,A17,C16 with an adult human as the oxygenator (see Historical Note in Section II of Chapter 2).W4 This was the beginning of the era of cardiac surgery using *cardiopulmonary bypass* (CPB), a term coined by Cooley a few years later. Five of the first eight patients were in their first year of life, and only two (40%; CL 14%- 71%) of the five died, a tribute to surgical skill, lack of cardiac ischemia (the aorta was not clamped), and quality of their human oxygenator. The dramatic weight gain of the surgically cured infants with large VSDs was documented. Three older patients, aged 4, 5, and 5 years, also survived, one of whom had multiple VSDs.

In 1956, DuShane and colleagues reported 20 patients who had undergone intracardiac repair of large VSDs with a mechanical pump-oxygenator at the Mayo Clinic beginning in March 1955.D11 Normothermic flow of 70 mL · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (about 2.1 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ) was used, along with a pump-sucker system to return intracardiac blood to the machine. Duration of CPB varied from 10 to 45 minutes. Four (20%; CL 10%-33%) of the 20 patients died in hospital, a mortality considered low in that era.

Truex described the location of the specialized conduction tissue in hearts with VSD.T12 In a more detailed study, Lev expanded on this topic,L9 and his work was the basis on which

Key: *VSD,* Ventricular septal defect.

Kirklin and DuShane developed a surgical technique that avoided producing heart block during VSD repair.C9,K20

Lillehei showed the feasibility of an atrial approach to VSD in 1957.S26 The technique of hypothermic circulatory arrest, with rewarming by a pump-oxygenator, was applied successfully to infants with VSD by Okamoto.O4 Kirklin and DuShane (1961) and Sloan's group (1967) reported the feasibility of primary repair of VSD in infants.K13,S11

Barratt-Boyes and colleagues (1969-1971) found that routine primary repair of VSD in sick, small infants was superior to pulmonary artery banding.B4

#### MORPHOLOGY

Although this chapter considers VSD that occurs as the primary lesion, the method of morphologic description is applied in other chapters to VSDs that are part of other major cardiac malformations. The morphologic classification described here represents an attempt to simplify VSD classification by encompassing all variations of the lesion while conforming to other systems of classification (Table 35-1). This classification conforms generally with the consensus of the Congenital Heart Surgery Nomenclature and Database ProjectJ1 and includes many of the concepts of Anderson and Wilcox.A13,A14

#### Size

VSDs are highly variable in size, and their division into size groups is arbitrary but useful. The echocardiographic criteria for VSD size are discussed in "Two-Dimensional Echocardiography" under Clinical Features and Diagnostic Criteria.

*Large VSDs* are approximately the size of the aortic orifice or larger. They offer little resistance to flow, and thus their VSD resistance index is less than 20 units  $\cdot$  m² in situations in which the calculation of the index is valid. H13,S3 Right ventricular (RV) systolic pressure approximates left ventricular (LV) pressure, and the pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio ( $\dot{Q}p/\dot{Q}s$ ) is increased to a degree dependent on the level of pulmonary vascular resistance (Rp).

Moderate-sized VSDs, although still restrictive, are of sufficient size to raise RV systolic pressure to approximately half LV pressure and Qp/Qs to 2.0 or greater.

Small VSDs are of insufficient size to raise RV systolic pressure, and  $\dot{Q}p/\dot{Q}s$  is not increased above 1.75. Small VSDs have a VSD resistance index greater than 20 units · m<sup>2</sup>. H13 Multiple small defects behave in aggregate as a large defect.

## Location in Septum and Relationship to Conduction System

VSDs can occur in all portions of the ventricular septum<sup>2</sup> (Fig. 35-1). VSDs with entirely muscular borders (muscular VSDs) may occupy several areas of the ventricular septum; other VSDs have one or several nonmuscular borders consisting of spaces or structures against which they are juxtaposed (Table 35-2). These nonmuscular borders may be a semilunar valve, an AV valve, or the crux cordis (intersection of the posterior aspect of the interventricular septum and AV junction). Some VSDs in the periphery of the ventricular septum are bordered by the ventricular free wall, but such VSDs are conventionally considered to be muscular. VSDs in the category of subarterial may be (1) juxta-aortic, (2) juxtapulmonary, (3) juxta-arterial (bordered by both pulmonary and aortic valves), or (4) juxtatruncal (bordered by the valve of a common arterial trunk). Subarterial VSDs are typically associated with some degree of overriding of the related arterial trunk, and the margin of the VSD is actually a space over which is a semilunar valve(s). A9

Many VSDs are associated with malalignment of portions of the ventricular septum or atrial septum relative to the interventricular septum, in which case an AV valve usually overrides the VSD. Malalignment VSD terminology results from two-dimensional (2D) echocardiographic examination of the heart regarding alignment of the trabecular and the outlet (conal) septum. In some cardiac anomalies, the aorta seems displaced relative to the VSD. The malalignment is referred to as *anterior* when the outlet septum appears anterior to the trabecular septum, with the VSD interposed. Tetralogy of Fallot-type defects are considered anterior malalignment types, with the aorta "overriding" the VSD (see Fig. 35-18, C). Malalignment is posterior when the outlet septum appears posterior to the trabecular septum in anomalies such as interrupted aortic arch and severe coarctation of the aorta. There may also be a rotational malalignment in anomalies characterized under the broad category of Taussig-Bing heart.

Anatomic location of the VSD determines its relation to the conduction system.

VSDs may also be characterized according to their commitment to the great arteries (Lev and colleagues<sup>L10</sup>): subartic, subpulmonary, doubly committed, and noncommitted.

Front of right ventricle, right atrium, and tricuspid valve have been removed. Shown are (1) doubly committed subarterial (juxta-arterial) VSD; (2) a perimembranous (conoventricular) VSD, which is juxta-aortic and juxtatricuspid; (3) an inlet septal VSD, which is juxtatricuspid and juxtamitral and, in this instance, juxtacrucial, a defect generally associated with atrial and ventricular septal malalignment and overriding tricuspid valve; and (4, 5, 6) trabecular VSDs. In positions 5 and 6, VSDs tend to be small and multiple, and when most of this trabeculated area and midmuscular septum are peppered with holes, the term Swiss cheese defect is used. Position 5 would be classified muscular, outlet type; position 6 is muscular, apical.

VSD resistance index =  $\frac{P_{LV} (peak) - P_{RV} (peak) \times BSA}{\dot{Q}p - \dot{Q}s}$ 

where BSA is body surface area,  $P_{LV}$  is left ventricular systolic pressure,  $P_{RV}$  is right ventricular systolic pressure,  $Q_P$  is pulmonary blood flow, and  $Q_S$  is systemic blood flow.

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>2</sup>The location is described in words that are relevant to the RV aspect of the VSD (see "Right Ventricle" under Cardiac Chambers and Major Vessels in Chapter 1), because most reparative procedures are performed from that aspect.

**Figure 35-2** Perimembranous ventricular septal defect *(VSD)* viewed from right ventricle. VSD borders anteroseptal commissure of tricuspid valve (juxtatricuspid) and has anterior extension to VSD and midportion of muscular septum. Key: *InfS,* Infundibular (outlet) septum; *PV,* pulmonary valve; *TV,* tricuspid valve.

This type of characterization—which is relational, not morphologic—preferably is restricted to hearts with double outlet ventricles, because its use in other situations has resulted in considerable confusion.

All these features of the location of VSDs should be included in descriptions of these defects.

#### *Perimembranous Ventricular Septal Defect*

Approximately 80% of patients operated on for primary VSD have a perimembranous VSD.S14,S16,V3 These defects could be called *junctional VSDs* because they are in the junctional area between the trabecular (sinus) and outlet (conal) portions of the ventricular septum (Fig. 35-2) and usually appear to be between the posterior and anterior divisions of the trabecula septomarginalis (septal band). Thus, these VSDs are between the outlet (conus) and inlet (ventricular) portions of the *right* ventricle, but characteristically they are in the outlet portion of the *left* ventricle.

Perimembranous VSDs are often associated with anomalies of the outlet septumO9 and other adjacent structures, although when small, they may be truly isolated anomalies. Some perimembranous VSDs are *juxtatricuspid* (abutting the tricuspid valve), *juxtamitral,* and *juxta-aortic*. B5 These perimembranous VSDs are also conoventricular (conotruncal)S15 (Fig. 35-3). Such defects abut the commissural area between the noncoronary and right coronary cusps of the aortic valve. Others are only juxtatricuspid (Fig. 35-4), and in hearts with these as well as in hearts with perimembranous VSDs, the bundle of His passes along the posteroinferior border of the defect.B5,K16,L5,S15 Some perimembranous VSDs abut none of these valvar structures and are separated from the tricuspid anulus posteriorly by a band of muscle that is part of the posterior division of the trabecula septomarginalis joining with the ventriculoinfundibular fold. The bundle of His is not in this muscular band but is in its usual position more posteriorly. Technically, although this type of defect is located in a perimembranous position, it is better classified as *muscular inlet–type VSD* because all borders are muscle.

Arrows indicate areas of tricuspid-mitral continuity, and defect borders tricuspid valve; it is juxtatricuspid, juxtamitral, and juxta-aortic. This defect, viewed from RV, lies far to the right in aortic margin of ventricular septum and thus is beneath the commissure between noncoronary and right coronary cusps. Defect is perimembranous, and no muscle is between it and anterior septal tricuspid commissure. Conal septum is hypoplastic but not malaligned. Key: *AO,* Aorta; *LV,* left ventricle; *MV,* mitral valve; *NC,* noncoronary cusp; *PV,* pulmonary valve; *RC,* right coronary cusp; *TV,* tricuspid valve. (From Soto and colleagues.S16)

VSDs have also been described in the past as *typically high, infracristal, membranous,* or *perimembranous,* without the original specific description.B5,B7,S14,S15

As already indicated, the AV node and penetrating portion of the bundle of His are in their normal position in hearts with perimembranous VSDs. As the bundle penetrates the fibrous right trigone of the central fibrous body at the base of the noncoronary cusp of the aortic valve, it lies along the posteroinferior border of perimembranous and inlet-type VSDs. As the bundle continues along the inferior border of the VSD (at times slightly to the left or right of the free edge), the left bundle branch fascicles emerge from the branching portion. Only the right bundle branch remains when the bundle reaches the level of the muscle of Lancisi.

Abnormalities of the ventricular portion of the membranous septum are often associated with perimembranous VSDs. The membranous septum may be absent or nearly so, and then the right trigone (beneath the nadir of the noncoronary aortic valve cusp) and base of the septal and anterior leaflets of the tricuspid valve are exposed and form the posteroinferior rim of the VSD (see Fig. 35-3). The bundle of His, as it penetrates the fibrous right trigone at the base of the noncoronary cusp, is intimately related to the posteroinferior angle of such a defect. This is associated with a deficiency in the posterior limb of the trabecula septomarginalis.K27 Rarely the ventricular portion of the membranous septum may be well developed, thickened, and perforated by one or many holes, forming an *aneurysm of the membranous septum* that bulges toward the right in systole. This so-called aneurysm is simulated on angiography by the much more common tethered anterior leaflet and the involved and usually fused chordae. Accessory fibrous tissue not part

**Figure 35-4** Perimembranous ventricular septal defect *(VSD)* of moderate size. **A,** VSD in region of anteroseptal commissure of tricuspid valve, viewed from right ventricle. VSD extends inferiorly beneath septal leaflet of tricuspid valve and abuts commissural area between anterior and septal tricuspid leaflets (juxtatricuspid) and remnant of membranous septum. Numerous tricuspid chordae and papillary muscles *(arrows)* are present. **B,** Same defect viewed from left ventricle. VSD lies below noncoronary cusp of aortic valve and is not juxta-aortic.

of the tricuspid valve mechanism may lie along the posterior or superior margin of the defect. This phenomenon is most marked in the *flap valve VSD*.

Not surprisingly, in hearts with perimembranous VSDs, still other adjacent structures may be abnormal. The medial papillary muscle characteristically joins the anteroinferior angle of the defect and receives chordae from adjacent portions of the tricuspid anterior and septal leaflets. These chordae may be increased in number and abnormally positioned around the edges of a perimembranous VSD, attached to the posterior edge, superior edge (Fig. 35-5), or most often anterior edge.U1 A thick leash of chordae joining the center of the anterior edge of a large defect may produce an appearance on angiography or even at operation of a double defect. Chordae from the anterior leaflet may attach to all three margins, and the anterior leaflet then limits the shunt from left to right through the defect, as well as hinder its repair.

Close association of some perimembranous VSDs with the commissure between anterior and septal tricuspid leaflets sometimes results in adherence of leaflet tissue to edges of the defect and shunting directly from LV into right atriumB13,L8 (Fig. 35-6). This so-called LV–right atrial defect,G6,P5,S18 which constitutes fewer than 5% of perimembranous VSDs in this region, rarely involves the AV septum. Adherence of tricuspid leaflet and chordal tissue is also an important mechanism of spontaneous closure of these VSDs.

#### *Ventricular Septal Defect in Right Ventricular Outlet (Doubly Committed Subarterial Ventricular Septal Defect)*

Some 5% to 10% of patients treated operatively have a single VSD, usually of moderate or large size, within the outlet portion of the RV. VSDs in this location are also in the outlet portion of the LV and, in contrast to perimembranous VSDs, are more beneath the right aortic cusp than the commissure between it and the noncoronary cusp. In the past, these have also been termed *conal, infundibular, supracristal,*

and *intracristal* defects. The complex morphology of the ventricular septum in the outlet portion of the RV and many controversies concerning the term "outlet septum" support use of a simple descriptive terminology for this group of VSDs.

VSDs in this general location are bordered in part by a space over which lie the pulmonary and aortic valvesS15 (Fig. 35-7). As such, these VSDs are subarterial. VSDs of this type are more common in Asians than in white or black races.T5 Subarterial VSDs may be circular, diamond shaped, or oval with the long axis lying transversely (Fig. 35-8). When viewed from the LV aspect, these defects are in the outflow portion of the ventricular septum (see Fig. 35-7, *B*), beneath the right coronary cusp (or commissure between it and the left cusp). The aortic and pulmonary valve cusps are separated by only a thin rim of fibrous tissue. The right aortic cusp and (less often) noncoronary cusp may prolapse into the upper margin of the defect, with or without aortic regurgitation (see Section II later in this chapter).

The posteroinferior margin of RV outlet VSDs is usually well separated from the tricuspid valve anulus by a band of muscle and is consequently well above the bundle of His. Occasionally, however, a particularly large confluent VSD may be both subarterial and perimembranous (Fig. 35-9). The conduction system is related to such a VSD as it is to other perimembranous defects. This particular type of VSD is sometimes associated with severe overriding of the aorta, and the cardiac anomaly is then termed *double outlet right ventricle* (DORV) *with doubly committed VSD*. The same type of VSD may also be seen in double outlet left ventricle (DOLV), in which the pulmonary artery severely overrides the VSD.

Morphology of these subarterial VSDs has been well elucidated by 2D echocardiography and color Doppler examinations.G11,S4 Despite the potential confusion of using Lev's *relational* terminology in a morphologic sense, in the echocardiographic literature, subarterial defects are usually referred to as *doubly committed VSDs*. Thus, it is useful to

**Figure 35-5** Perimembranous ventricular septal defect *(VSD)* associated with anomalous leaflet tissue. **A,** VSD viewed from right ventricle. Note chordal attachment *(arrow)* of anterior tricuspid leaflet to anterosuperior margin of defect. Normal position of infundibular (outlet) septum between two limbs of trabecula septomarginalis (septal band) is well seen. **B,** Same defect viewed from right atrium. VSD is partly obscured by tricuspid leaflet tissue, but its extent is indicated by dashed line. **C,** Same defect viewed from left ventricle. VSD is immediately beneath aortic valve (juxta-aortic), and its extent is indicated by dashed line. Abnormal tricuspid valve attachments are obvious and on an angiocardiogram are indistinguishable from an aneurysm of the membranous ventricular septum.

combine morphologic and echocardiographic descriptions to characterize these VSDs occurring in the RV outlet as *doubly committed subarterial VSDs*. Echocardiography has demonstrated that aortic and pulmonary valves are frequently at the same level in the presence of subarterial (or doubly committed) VSDs, rather than the pulmonary valve being elevated above (cephalad to) or offset relative to the aortic valve, seemingly by the RV infundibulum.G11 This description often provides a diagnostic tool useful in both echocardiography and angiography, along with the finding that the outlet septum appears to be absent and the subpulmonary infundibulum deficient. Echocardiography has also demonstrated the frequently associated prolapse of an aortic cusp and aortic regurgitation present in up to half of patients with this type of VSD.S4 Aortic cusp prolapse may nearly close the VSD during diastole. At times the fibrous raphe between the arterial valves is displaced relative to the ventricular septum, resulting in overriding of one arterial valve and narrowing of the other.G11

Some VSDs in the RV outlet are only *juxta-aortic* and abut the nadir of the right coronary cusp. The cusp typically prolapses through this type of VSD, and aortic regurgitation frequently develops.S16 Rarely, VSDs in the RV outlet are only juxtapulmonary and lie far to the left.

Some defects in the outlet portion of the septum have *muscular* borders and lie in the substance of the infundibular septum (muscular VSD, outlet type), with a muscle bridge of infundibular septum superior to the defect. The superior muscular bridge may be malaligned and displaced leftward into the aortic outflow tract (posterior malalignment type of VSD), producing muscular subaortic stenosis that lies above the VSD.M11 This anomaly occasionally occurs in association with interrupted aortic arch and with coarctation,A10,D4,F4 although perimembranous VSDs are more common in both settings.

#### *Inlet Septal Ventricular Septal Defect*

Five percent or less of surgical patients have *inlet septal VSD* (or *AV septal type* or *AV canal type* of VSD).N4 This defect involves the RV *inlet septum* beneath the tricuspid septal leaflet and LV *outlet septum*. Its posterior margin is formed by the exposed AV valve anulus (juxtatricuspid), and its

anterior margin is muscular and crescentic (Fig. 35-10). Superiorly, inlet septal defects usually extend to the membranous septum. The AV septum is intact, in contrast to the situation in hearts with AV canal septal defects (see Morphology in Chapter 34). The anterior (septal) mitral leaflet occasionally may be cleft, either partially or completely, with associated mitral regurgitation. Rarely, VSDs in the inlet portion of the septum extend completely to the crux cordis and thus are also *juxtacrucial* in position. The tricuspid valve is overriding and usually straddling.

In inlet septal VSDs, the AV node lies more laterally and anteriorly along the tricuspid anulus than normal and at the point at which the tricuspid anulus meets the underlying ventricular septum, because of straddling of the tricuspid valve.H17 The bundle of His lies along the *posteroinferior* rim of the inlet septal VSD, slightly on the LV side, as in juxtatricuspid VSDs.

A *muscular VSD* can occur in the inlet portion of the ventricular septum beneath the tricuspid septal leaflet (Fig. 35-11). The posterior margin of such a defect is separated from the tricuspid ring by muscle. A muscular VSD must be distinguished from the inlet septal type of VSD because the conducting tissue runs superior and anterior to a muscular defect.

#### *Muscular Ventricular Septal Defect*

VSDs in other locations are generally muscular VSDs. Such defects are frequently multiple and may be associated with perimembranous or subarterial VSDs. Single or multiple muscular defects in the trabecular septum are more common

in infants requiring operative treatment than in older children.

Muscular defects can occur anywhere in the ventricular septum (see Fig. 35-1). Those in the middle portion of the trabecular septum are the most common (Fig. 35-12) and may be overlaid by the trabecula septomarginalis; thus, even when single on the LV side, these defects have at least two openings on the RV side. Anterior muscular defects are usually multiple and most often in the apical and outlet portions of the septum. They may extend all along the anterior part of the septum from apex to outlet septum. Typically there are more openings on the RV than LV side.

A particularly important group of patients are those with *Swiss cheese defects* (Fig. 35-13), many defects of variable size, not only along the anterior portion of the septum but throughout the midportion as well. These defects often pass obliquely through the septum to appear on both sides of the trabecula septomarginalis or in the anterior part of the septum. They may be associated with large or small perimembranous or subarterial defects. Major associated cardiac anomalies are common, especially severe coarctation of the aorta.

The bundle of His is not closely related to the borders of any muscular VSD.

#### *Confluent Ventricular Septal Defect*

Some unusually large, single confluent VSDs involve more than one area of the septum. Rarely a confluent VSD may involve most of the septum (Fig. 35-14), but hearts with such defects should not be classified as having a single ventricle.

#### *Ventricular Septal Defect with Straddling or Overriding Tricuspid Valve*

In rare instances, tricuspid valve chordae may *straddle* the ventricular septum in association with a large inlet septal defect resembling an inlet septal–type VSD but extending to the crux cordisL12,M10,R3 (Fig. 35-15). The tricuspid valve usually *overrides* both ventricles. When overriding is severe, the tricuspid anulus is usually very large, and many chordae from it are attached to the LV side of the septum (a combination of straddling and overriding).B8 The atrial septum is malaligned relative to the ventricular septum. The RV is often hypoplastic. The tricuspid valve may be regurgitant.

#### Associated Lesions

Nearly half of patients undergoing surgical treatment for a primary VSD have an associated cardiac anomaly.B10,G9 A moderate-sized or large *patent ductus arteriosus* (PDA) is

present in about 6% of patients of all ages, but about 25% of infants in heart failure. VSD occurs in combination with moderate or severe *coarctation of the aorta* in about 5% of patients. This combination is also much more common among infants with large VSD coming to operation younger than age 3 months.

Congenital *aortic stenosis* occurs in about 2% of patients requiring operation for VSD. Subvalvar stenosis is more common than valvarL4 and may also occur in association with infundibular pulmonary stenosis. *Subvalvar stenosis* can be due to (1) a discrete fibromuscular bar lying inferior (caudad or upstream) to the VSD; (2) a discrete fibromuscular bar located distal (downstream) to the VSD, often consisting of displacement of infundibular septal muscle into the LV outflow tract (posterior malalignment), and often associated with aortic coarctation and interrupted archA10,D6,M14 (see "Morphology" in Sections I and II of Chapter 48); (3) pulmonary artery bandingF3; and (4) excrescences of AV valvar tissue.N2

Congenital *mitral valve disease* occurs in about 2% of patients.B10 One of the *pulmonary arteries* may be absent or severely stenotic. Severe peripheral pulmonary artery stenoses occur rarely.

Although *atrial septal defects* in general are not considered major associated anomalies, they may coexist with a large VSD in small infants and may be important lesions.

Severe positional cardiac anomalies (e.g., isolated dextrocardia, situs inversus totalis) are *uncommon* in patients with VSD.

#### Pulmonary Vascular Disease

The classic description of the pathology of hypertensive pulmonary vascular disease is that of Heath and EdwardsH4 (Box 35-1).

Rp in patients with large VSD (and those with large PDA) is positively correlated with histologic severity of the hypertensive pulmonary vascular disease, classified by Heath and **Box 35-1** Heath-Edwards Classification of Pulmonary Vascular Disease Pathology

#### **Grade 1**

Medial hypertrophy without intimal proliferation

#### **Grade 2**

Medial hypertrophy with cellular intimal reaction

#### **Grade 3**

Medial hypertrophy with intimal fibrosis and possibly early generalized vascular dilatation

#### **Grade 4**

Generalized vascular dilatation, areas of vascular occlusion by intimal fibrosis, and plexiform lesions

#### **Grade 5**

Other dilatation plexiform lesions such as cavernous and angiomatoid lesions

#### **Grade 6**

Necrotizing arteritis in addition to characteristics of grade 5 changes

colleaguesH5 (Fig. 35-16). A close positive correlation also exists between lowest Rp at rest or with isoproterenol infusion and Heath-Edwards grade of vascular disease. Heath-Edwards grades above 3 were not found in patients with Rp index less than 7 units · m2 , whereas those with Rp greater than 8.5 units · m2 showed changes characteristic of grade 4 or greater.B17 Similarly, Fried and colleagues found a rather close negative correlation (*P* = .001) between magnitude of left-to-right shunt and Heath-Edwards grade in infants and children coming to VSD repair.F5 Variability in these mattersB17 is not unexpected because Heath-Edwards classification is based on the most severe lesion seen, regardless of its frequency. As noted by Wagenvoort and colleaguesW1,W2 and Yamaki and Tezuka,Y3 grading should include assessment of the number of vessels affected. In addition, calculation of Rp is open to errors.H12

Hislop and colleagues provide a different view of hypertensive pulmonary vascular disease in infants with large VSD.H10 Other investigators had noted earlier that intimal proliferation (and thus Heath-Edwards changes of grade 2 or greater) rarely develops in patients with large VSD until 1 or 2 years of age,D2,W1 despite infants occasionally having severely elevated Rp. Hislop and colleagues found that infants dying at 3 to 6 months of age with large VSD and high (>8 units · m2 ) Rp with intermittent right-to-left shunting have marked medial hypertrophy affecting both large and small pulmonary

![](_page_12_Figure_4.jpeg)

**Figure 35-16** Probability of hypertensive pulmonary vascular disease (HPDV) greater than grade 2 in patients with ventricular septal defect, given total pulmonary resistance index (units · m2 ). Dotted lines enclose 70% confidence limits (*P* = .07). (From Heath and colleagues.H5)

arteries, including those less than 200 µm in diameter.H10 The usual number of intraacinar vessels was present. By contrast, these investigators found that infants 3 to 10 months of age with large VSDs dying with a history of large Qp and heart failure and normal or slightly elevated Rp have medial hypertrophy affecting mainly arteries larger than 200 µm. The intraacinar vessels were fewer than usual, so-called lessened arterial density. These histologic features have been shown by Rabinovitch and colleagues to correlate with pulmonary hemodynamic findings after repair of VSDs.R1 Fried and colleagues have emphasized that Heath-Edwards grade and arterial density are the best correlates of fall in pulmonary artery pressure after repair.F5

Histologic reversibility of pulmonary vascular disease after closure of VSD has not been documented. Favorable results in infants may be from an increase in arterial density as growth proceeds. Presumably, pulmonary vascular disease of Heath-Edwards grade 3 or greater severity is not reversible.

#### CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

#### Clinical Findings

In infants, signs and symptoms of heart failure include tachypnea and liver enlargement, often associated with poor feeding and growth failure, and physical findings of a precordial pansystolic or more abbreviated systolic murmur and a hyperactive heart. These findings suggest the diagnosis of a large VSD. An apical diastolic murmur suggests large flow across the mitral valve during diastole, the result of a large Qp . Cardiomegaly and evidence of large Qp are seen on the chest radiograph (Fig. 35-17). The electrocardiogram (ECG) usually shows biventricular hypertrophy. In older patients with large VSD, the history is often nonspecific, but

![](_page_12_Figure_11.jpeg)

**Figure 35-17** Chest radiographs of children with ventricular septal defect (VSD). **A,** Large VSD in 11-year-old girl with large left-to-right shunt, severe pulmonary hypertension, and low pulmonary vascular resistance. Cardiac enlargement and increased pulmonary vascularity are evident. Pulmonary trunk is enlarged and aortic arch small. Examination revealed an overactive heart with a systolic thrill and a loud (grade 4), long systolic murmur extending from lower left sternal border to apex and an apical diastolic murmur. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed evidence of left ventricular overwork. **B,** Large VSD in 10-year-old girl with severe pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary/systemic flow ratio of 1.2, and pulmonary vascular resistance of 11 units · m2 . Cardiac size is normal, but pulmonary trunk is enlarged. Pulmonary vascularity is not increased. Examination revealed a quiet heart, no thrill, a soft (grade 2) systolic murmur, and no apical diastolic murmur; closure of pulmonic valve was loud and palpable. ECG demonstrated right ventricular hypertrophy without evidence of left ventricular overwork. (From Kirklin and DuShane.K14)

examination also shows evidence of LV and RV enlargement and a systolic murmur usually best heard in the third and fourth left interspaces. In patients with doubly committed subarterial VSDs, the systolic murmur is maximal in the second and third interspaces, and in defects shunting mainly into the right atrium, in the fourth and fifth interspaces.

A high Rp from severe pulmonary vascular disease changes the hemodynamic state and clinical findings in patients with large VSDs. A large left-to-right shunt is no longer present because output resistances of the two pathways for LV emptying are similar, and the shunt is bidirectional and of about equal magnitude in both directions. The heart is not enlarged or hyperactive. A systolic murmur (produced by the large flow across the VSD) is soft or absent, and no apical diastolic murmur is heard. The pulmonary component of the second sound at the base is loud and sometimes palpable. Chest radiography reflects these features (see Fig. 35-17). ECG shows severe RV hypertrophy rather than combined ventricular hypertrophy, and evidence of LV volume overload. When pulmonary vascular disease is even more advanced, cyanosis develops *(Eisenmenger complex)* because the shunt across the VSD becomes right to left as RV output resistance through the pulmonary vascular bed becomes higher than that through the VSD and aorta.

Patients with *small* VSDs have small shunts and often no abnormal signs or symptoms other than a pansystolic murmur. Chest radiography and ECG both may be normal. When the defect is *moderate* in size, the LV is mildly or moderately enlarged (shown by physical examination, chest radiography, and ECG), and the volume of the RV is increased.

When there is associated *pulmonary or aortic stenosis,* diagnostic features are changed. Thus, with important pulmonary stenosis, Qp is reduced, and the shunt may even be right to left. RV hypertrophy is increased. With important aortic stenosis, the load on the LV is increased, and if the obstruction is cephalad to the VSD, left-to-right shunt is also greater, resulting in more than the expected degree of LV hypertrophy on ECG. Coarctation of the aorta may also produce these features in older children.

#### Two-Dimensional Echocardiography

Two-dimensional echocardiography imaging of the VSD with color Doppler flow evaluation of shunt flow by proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA)K28 has changed traditional views about preoperative studies. Thus, cardiac catheterization and cineangiography are not necessary before closure of primary VSDs when (1) the clinical syndrome in neonates and infants indicates a large Qp/Q s; (2) noninvasive imaging clearly defines the morphology, including that of the aortic arch and ductus arteriosus; and (3) the surgeon is experienced in surgical identification and repair of congenital heart disease.C2

For identifying a large single perimembranous VSD, combined 2D echocardiography and Doppler flow interrogation is highly reliable in combination with clinical criteriaB9,O10 (Fig. 35-18). Echocardiography adds to anatomic clarification, particularly in the case of doubly committed subarterial VSDs.G11 Particularly for small VSDs and multiple muscular defects, 2D Doppler color flow echocardiographic imaging increases the sensitivity of echocardiographyL18 (Fig. 35-18, *A* and *B*). However, and particularly in the presence of a single large VSD, multiple muscular defects can go undetected even with refined techniques of echocardiography.L18 Because perimembranous VSDs are infrequently (<3%C8) accompanied by additional muscular VSDs, this does not contraindicate proceeding to repair in infants without cardiac catheterization. Malalignment VSD is diagnosed by 2D echocardiography by the appearance of the alignment of the RV trabecular septum with the outlet septum. Malalignment may be *anterior* as in tetralogy of Fallot (Fig. 35-18, *C*), *posterior* as in interrupted aortic arch, or *rotational* as in Taussig-Bing heart.

Size of a VSD is generally categorized echocardiographically as small, moderate, or large for purposes of decisions regarding surgery (see Morphology and Indications for Operation later in this chapter).H16 A *large* defect has a diameter of 75% or greater of the aortic anulus and lowvelocity flow by Doppler, measuring no more than 1 m · s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . A *moderate* defect has a diameter of 33% to 75% of the aortic anulus and flow velocity of 1 to 4 m · s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , indicating moderate flow restriction. (By the modified Bernoulli equation, gradient across the defect is calculated by multiplying velocity squared times 4.) A *small* defect has a diameter less than 33% of the aortic anulus and a flow velocity of 4 m · s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> or greater. When considering Rp, it is important to note that as resistance (or obstructions in the RV outflow tract) increases, flow velocity across the VSD decreases.

#### Other Noninvasive Diagnostic Methods

Other noninvasive imaging modalities may come into use. At present, only magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown promise to provide accurate information about the morphology of all types of VSDs.B1 Dynamic three-dimensional echocardiographic reconstructions may refine ability to image and portray VSDs spacially.T3

#### Cardiac Catheterization

When surgical intervention is under consideration in older children, cardiac catheterization and angiography are generally indicated to assess Rp and precisely identify location, size, and number of VSDs and any associated anomalies. Furthermore, preoperative sizing of VSDs is often important in arriving at management decisions. Sizing can be especially difficult when the VSD is associated with another lesion such as coarctation or pulmonary stenosis. The most reliable way to size the defect is to measure its diameter either by 2D color flow Doppler echocardiography or cineangiography. With cineangiography, the VSD must be accurately profiled and the measurement either corrected to allow for magnification or compared with aortic root diameter. In applying this method to perimembranous VSDs, the defect is smaller in a cranially tilted left anterior oblique (LAO) projection than in the conventional LAO position.

Cardiac catheterization should include both right-sided and left-sided heart studies, the latter mainly to obtain LV angiograms. Basic data obtained at cardiac catheterization should include oxygen consumption (V O2 ); systolic, diastolic, and mean pulmonary arterial, pulmonary artery wedge, and systemic arterial pressures; oxygen content and saturation in right atrial, pulmonary arterial, aortic, or peripheral arterial blood and, when possible, left atrial blood. Pulmonary (Qp ) and systemic (Qs ) blood flows and Qp/Q s

are calculated<sup>3</sup> with Rp (Table 35-3). When left atrial (or pulmonary arterial wedge) pressure is not available, only total pulmonary resistance (TPR)<sup>4</sup> can be calculated. Rp in absolute units × body surface area is of more value in predicting operability than is the ratio of resistances in pulmonary and systemic circuits. When Rp is elevated, further information concerning operability should be obtained by assessing response to exercise and to isoproterenol (see Indications for Operation later in this chapter).

#### Angiography

Angiographic assessment of VSD is best performed using biplane techniques in appropriate projections. B2,E4 Whereas cardiologists and radiologists carry primary responsibility for these studies, appreciation of their findings and limitations is

#### **NATURAL HISTORY**

#### Spontaneous Closure

VSDs tend to close spontaneously. <sup>E6</sup> This is relevant to decisions about operation and explains, for the most part, the infrequency with which large VSDs are encountered in adults. <sup>C17</sup> Spontaneous closure can be complete by 1 year of

**Figure 35-19** Line drawings of angiographic projections for assessment of ventricular septal defect *(VSD)*. **A,** Interrelationships of left ventricle (LV) and aortic root *(thick line)* with right ventricle (RV) and pulmonary trunk *(thin line)* in 40-degree right anterior oblique *(RAO)*, 50-degree left anterior oblique *(LAO)*, and 40-degree cranially tilted *(CR. LAO)* projections. RAO view profiles infundibular (conal) and high anterior portions of RV outlet septum below and in front of right coronary sinus and profiles atrioventricular (AV) septum beneath noncoronary sinus of aortic root. Both LAO views profile apical trabecular portion of septum. LAO view also partly profiles RV outlet septum but superimposes it on LV outflow tract and aortic root. CR. LAO projection views RV outlet septum en face and superimposes it on LV. Because orientation shows a horizontally lying heart, LAO view depicts full length (cranial to caudal) of apical and anterior trabecular portion of ventricular septum and AV valve anuli *(interrupted lines)*, whereas CR. LAO view depicts full length of sinus portion of trabecular septum from base to apex. **B,** Both cranially tilted *(CR. LAO)* and conventional LAO views are required for a complete assessment of sinus septum. Basal (inlet) *(O, x)* VSDs are separated from more apical *(o)* VSDs by CR. LAO projection, whereas high *(x)* VSDs are separated from low *(O)* VSDs by LAO view. **C,** Anatomic and hemodynamic features of VSDs shown by LV angiograms. LAO diagrams show a compromise between conventional and cranially tilted options. LV and aorta are shown by thick lines, RV and pulmonary trunk by thin lines, and AV valves and nonprofiled VSDs by interrupted lines. **C1,** Perimembranous VSD. LAO view profiles VSD just beneath parietal band (ventriculoinfundibular fold) at upper margin of inlet septum. Flow enters base of RV above tricuspid valve, filling base before reaching infundibulum. Tricuspid valve is well seen in diastole, and lower margin of defect can be accurately related to tricuspid anulus in LAO. RAO view does not profile defect unless it extends into outlet septum. Note intact AV septum beneath noncoronary sinus of aortic root. Shunt enters RV infundibulum, crossing but not interrupting intact superior margin of LV, indicating intact conal and high anterior septal regions. **C2,** Doubly committed subarterial VSD (labeled *conal septal VSD*). LAO view shows an intact septum from aortic valve to apex. RV sinus usually fills only faintly by diastolic mixing from infundibular region, and tricuspid valve may not be seen. Defect is superimposed on aortic root. RAO view profiles defect beneath contiguous parts of aortic and pulmonary valves. Systolic streaming through RV infundibulum to pulmonary trunk is well shown, with some mixing to more anterior part of RV in diastole, but high anterior septal region is intact.

![](_page_16_Figure_2.jpeg)

**C3,** Inlet septal VSD (labeled *basal muscular VSD*). VSD is adjacent to tricuspid valve (AV septal type) or separated from it by a rim of muscle (muscular VSD). These two types of VSDs are not readily distinguished radiologically. In LAO view, defect is profiled between AV valves, replacing full height of basal septum (conventional LAO view), perhaps extending into adjacent middle portion of ventricular septum but not into apical region (cranially tilted LAO view). Contrast medium streams directly into base of RV sinus in systole, providing a good depiction of tricuspid orifice in diastole. Separate AV valves are present, in contrast to the finding in a complete AV septal defect (see Chapter 34). In RAO view, VSD is not profiled. Intact AV septum distinguishes this defect from a true AV septal defect. Note intact conal and high anterior septal regions. **C4,** Muscular, trabecular VSD (labeled *mid-muscular VSD*). LAO views show an intact inlet septum and no extension into apical region, although a small additional defect is seen in diastole, closing in systole. Some of the contrast medium streams directly into RV outflow during systole. Height of defect from floor of ventricle (bottom of AV valve) is appreciated in LAO view, and separation from basal and apical regions in cranially tilted LAO view. RAO features are as in parts **C1** and **C3. C5,** Multiple muscular anterior and apical VSDs. Muscular VSDs in these regions frequently coexist and, if numerous, form a continuous series throughout trabeculated septum from high in RV infundibulum to apical sinus septum. For clarity, only highest and lowest are shown here. In LAO view, intact basal and middle septal regions are profiled. Apical defects are profiled, but high anterior defects are superimposed on LV outflow region. Contrast medium tends to stream to RV outflow tract without filling basal parts. In RAO view, high anterior defects are profiled, interrupting superior margin of LV anterior to intact outlet septum. More defects are open in diastole than in systole.

*Continued*

age, or the defect may have only narrowed by then, with complete closure taking considerably longer. An inverse relation exists between the probability of eventual spontaneous closure and age at which the patient is observedA6,B10,H13,K24 (Fig. 35-21). About 80% of patients with large VSDs seen at age 1 month experience eventual spontaneous closure, as do about 60% of those seen at age 3 months, about 50% of those seen at age 6 months, and about 25% of those seen at age 12 months. This decreasing tendency for spontaneous closure of a VSD as the patient grows older has also been confirmed by Beerman and colleagues,B6 and spontaneous closure has been documented to occur in only one patient between age 21 and 31 years.H19 Onat and colleagues studied 106 children with VSD and concluded that these patients should be followed closely through adolescence because the defects may decrease in diameter, shunt flow may diminish, and spontaneous closure may be expected in 23% of patients.O8

The mechanism of narrowing or closure of perimembranous VSDs is usually adherence of tricuspid leaflet or chordal tissue to the edges of the VSD.C1,S30 Closure has erroneously been related to echocardiographic diagnosis of aneurysm of the membranous septum.R2 Aneurysm of the membranous septum is usually considered benign and functionally reduces the size of the VSD. It has the potential consequence of promoting tricuspid regurgitation and RV outflow tract obstruction and is a nidus for infective endocarditis.Y5

Perimembranous VSDs, as well as VSDs that are juxtaaortic and inlet VSDs of the AV septal type, are less likely to

**Figure 35-21** Probability of eventual spontaneous closure of a large ventricular septal defect *(VSD)* according to age at which patient is observed. Dotted lines enclose 70% confidence limits. Specific ratios, with 70% confidence limits, reported by Hoffman and Rudolph<sup>H13</sup> and Keith and colleagues<sup>K7</sup> are shown centered on mean or assumed ages of patients in their reports. *P* for age < .0001.

close than juxtatricuspid or subarterial muscular VSDs.<sup>C1</sup> Perimembranous VSD with LV-to-right atrial shunt (Gerbode defect) in infancy is also associated with less chance of spontaneous closure.<sup>K8,K21,S19,W6</sup>

Inferences about the tendency toward spontaneous closure seem to be in disagreement with the results of some studies. Hoffman and Rudolph's data (one of the sources for Fig. 35-21) indicate that 80% of infants aged 6 weeks with large VSDs will experience spontaneous closure or reduction in size of the VSD. H13 Rowe found that none of 11 infants (mean age 46 days) with a VSD 80% or greater in diameter than that of the aorta showed subsequent reduction in size during the period of observation. R8 These apparent discrepancies may be explained by lack of information about location or size of VSDs.

#### Pulmonary Vascular Disease

A large VSD exposes the patient to risk of developing increased Rp from hypertensive pulmonary vascular disease, which tends to worsen with age. Thus, the proportion of patients with large VSDs who have severely elevated Rp is directly related to age (Fig. 35-22). The statement that some infants younger than 2 years of age with large VSDs have severely elevated Rp is doubted by some, but its occurrence is well documented.

Some infants and children with severely elevated Rp have not undergone the usual fall in Rp a few weeks to a few months after birth. Others have undergone this decrease,  $^{\rm J6}$  but later in the first 2 years of life, they have developed a rapid increase in Rp.  $^{\rm H14}$ 

Some infants with large VSDs and most of those with moderate-sized VSDs have normal or mildly elevated Rp and retain this through the first decade of life. Then, if their VSD is still large, more severe pulmonary vascular changes may or may not develop as they age. In infants with small VSDs, pulmonary vascular disease does not develop. K14

#### Infective Endocarditis

Infective endocarditis is rare in patients with VSD, occurring at a rate of about 0.15% to 0.3% per year. C1,C21,G7,S9 Its prevalence is greater in males and individuals older than 20 years of age. Infective endocarditis is more common in small and moderate VSDs than in large VSDs. Often a pulmonary process is the presenting feature, presumably developing from emboli secondary to right-sided bacterial vegetations or bacteria carried to the lungs by left-to-right-directed flow through the VSD. Prognosis with modern antibiotic treatment regimens is good.

#### Premature Death

Past experience and reports in the literature indicate that without surgical treatment, about 9% of infants with *large* VSDs die from them in the first year of life. Death may result from heart failure, which may develop very early but usually occurs at about age 2 to 3 months, presumably because at that time the left-to-right shunt increases as the medial hypertrophy present in the small pulmonary arteries at birth regresses. Death may also result from recurrent pulmonary infections, often viral in origin, secondary to pulmonary edema from high pulmonary venous pressure. Death is most likely to occur in those infants with large VSDs who have associated conditions of major anatomic or functional importance, such as PDA, coarctation of the aorta, or large atrial septal defect.

After the age of 1 year, few if any patients die of their VSD until the second decade of life. By then, many patients whose VSDs have remained large have pulmonary vascular disease and ultimately die with complications of Eisenmenger complex<sup>C15</sup> (Fig. 35-23). These include hemoptysis, polycythemia, cerebral abscess or infarction, and right-sided heart failure.

Patients with *small* VSDs die very rarely as a result of bacterial endocarditis. However, in common with patients with larger VSDs, some of these patients may develop disturbed systolic function and increased compliance in both ventricles. Oll

Note that fatalities begin to occur in the second decade of life, about half the patients were dead by age 35, and a few survived until 50 years of age. (Modified from Clarkson and colleagues. C15)

#### Clinical Course

Patients with small VSDs rarely have symptoms related to the defect. Those with large VSDs may have symptoms of intractable heart failure in the first few months of life, with poor peripheral pulses, inability to feed, sweating, and chronic pulmonary edema. About half the patients coming to operation in the first 2 years of life do so because of intractable heart failure. During early life, rapid and labored respiration and recurrent pulmonary infections may occur secondary to high pulmonary venous pressure and chronic pulmonary edema. Lobes of the lung may become chronically hyperinflated because of pressure of the large and tense pulmonary arteries on the bronchi, preventing complete escape of air during expiration. O2 All this causes many babies with large VSDs to be small and physically underdeveloped. Symptomatic patients who fail to respond well to medical management are at particular risk of dying in the first year of life. Some babies who survive through the first year of life with large VSDs have controlled heart failure and failure to thrive in the second year of life as well.

Children and young adults with large VSDs are usually symptomatic and tend to be small in both height and weight. As pulmonary vascular disease develops, symptoms may regress.

#### Development of Aortic Regurgitation

See Section II: Ventricular Septal Defect and Aortic Regurgitation

#### Development of Infundibular Pulmonary Stenosis

A small proportion (5%-10%) of patients with large VSDs and large left-to-right shunt in infancy develop infundibular pulmonary stenosis. <sup>G3,H15</sup> The mild and moderate infundibular pulmonary stenoses in patients operated on for primary VSD,

as well as some of the more important pulmonary stenoses, probably develop in this way. Stenosis may become severe enough to produce shunt reversal and cyanosis, and the condition then can properly be termed *tetralogy of Fallot* (see Chapter 38). Those who undergo the transformation probably are born with a mild degree of anterior displacement of the infundibular septum and its extensions.

#### **TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION**

VSDs are repaired either through the right atrium, RV, or in special circumstances, LV or pulmonary trunk. K15 Currently, RV and LV approaches are rarely used. Repair is done on conventional CPB at 20°C to 28°C, with direct caval cannulation and brief periods of low flow perfusion or (rarely) total circulatory arrest (see Sections III and IV of Chapter 2). For infants weighing less than about 3 kg, a single venous cannula may be used, and the repair is performed during hypothermic circulatory arrest (see Section IV of Chapter 2). Cold cardioplegia is used in all cases.

After the usual anesthetic and surgical preparations (see Chapter 4), a median sternotomy is made. Presence of anomalies of pulmonary or systemic venous return is determined. It should be known from preoperative study whether the ductus arteriosus is open or closed. An open ductus during open cardiotomy, particularly during hypothermic circulatory arrest, allows air to enter the aorta and later migrate to the brain; during CPB an open ductus increases intracardiac return and overdistends the pulmonary circulation. A patent ductus is ligated from the anterior approach, usually during cooling. In neonates and infants undergoing hypothermic circulatory arrest, the ductus is ligated as a routine procedure.

#### Repair of Perimembranous Ventricular Septal Defect

After CPB (with or without circulatory arrest) has been established, the aorta is occluded, cold cardioplegic solution injected, and the right atrium opened obliquely. A suction device is placed across the naturally present or surgically created foramen ovale (Fig. 35-24). Before repair is started, the defect is carefully examined to establish that all margins can be seen and reached. In rare circumstances in which this is not possible because of chordal arrangement, an incision is made to disconnect a portion of the tricuspid valve from the anulus, and the VSD is exposed through the resulting aperture. Particular attention is directed toward determining whether the VSD is juxtatricuspid, in which case it abuts the tricuspid valve in the region of the commissure between septal and anterior leaflets. If the VSD has a bar of muscle of varying width between it and the tricuspid valve, it is not juxtatricuspid. Relationship of the bundle of His to the posterior and inferior margins of the defect must be clearly understood (see Morphology earlier in this section) to accomplish a safe repair (Fig. 35-24, A).

In older infants and children, the VSD is repaired with a polyester patch sewn in place with continuous polypropylene sutures (Fig. 35-24, *B*), a technique confirmed to be entirely adequate in such patients. In neonates and small infants, the technique may not be adequate because of the delicate nature and friability of the structures. In these patients, the patch may be sewn into place using a combination of continuous and interrupted pledgeted mattress sutures or, alternatively,

![](_page_21_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 35-24** Repair of perimembranous ventricular septal defect *(VSD)* from right atrium, continuous suture technique. **A,** Right atriotomy is parallel to atrioventricular groove from right atrial appendage toward inferior vena cava. Stay sutures are placed to expose tricuspid orifice. Superior edge of VSD is not visible because of overlying anterior leaflet of tricuspid valve. Atrioventricular node lies within triangle of Koch, with bundle of His penetrating to ventricular septum at posterior angle of VSD, where it is particularly vulnerable to injury. **B,** Repair of VSD is started at junction of septal with anterior leaflets of tricuspid valve. A pledget-reinforced 4-0 polypropylene suture is placed as a mattress stitch through tricuspid anulus, with pledget on atrial side of tricuspid valve. Suture is passed through a knitted double-velour polyester patch trimmed to slightly larger than size of VSD. Alternative patch material could be pericardium or polytetrafluoroethylene. **C,** Continuous stitches are placed along right side of superior rim of defect to approximate patch to ventricular septum. Simultaneous traction on suture and on patch exposes next area to be stitched and provides good visibility. Aortic valve is located to left side of septum in this area (ventriculoinfundibular fold) and must be protected from inclusion of cusp tissue in suture line. Opposite end of suture is then passed through septal leaflet of tricuspid valve as a continuous mattress stitch working inferiorly. Bundle of His crosses beneath this portion of suture line. Stitches must not penetrate tricuspid anulus or into atrial myocardium, to preserve integrity of conduction system.

employing exclusively interrupted mattress sutures reinforced with small pledgets.

A ventricular approach may be used when the VSD cannot be well visualized from the right atrium. An RV approach is performed through a transverse incision. The patch is sewn into place with continuous or interrupted sutures (Fig. 35-25). Technique of repair and sequence for suturing shown in Fig. 35-25 are slightly different from those shown for the atrial approach. Suturing begins at the transition point between the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve and the

![](_page_22_Picture_2.jpeg)

**D,** At a point 5 to 7 mm below inferior margin of VSD, suture line is transitioned from septal leaflet onto ventricular septum. Stitching continues along inferior rim of VSD, with stitches placed 5 to 7 mm below rim until reaching muscle of Lancisi. An alternative technique uses interrupted pledgeted mattress sutures for very thin portions of the septal leaflet and posteroinferior edge of defect (conduction system) to facilitate secure suture placement while avoiding conduction system. Remainder of suture line employs a continuous suture technique. **E,** Suture line may come to edge of VSD anterior to muscle of Lancisi and is continued until meeting previously completed superior suture line. Suture ends are joined to complete repair. Alternatively, repair may begin at point described here as end point.D8 Initial suture line proceeds along superior edge of defect to junction of anterior and septal leaflet of tricuspid valve. Second part of suture line is carried along septum inferiorly, 5 to 7 mm below edge of defect, transitions to septal leaflet, then proceeds as a continuous mattress stitch along septal leaflet superiorly to join other end of suture to complete repair. Key: *Ao,* Aorta; *IVC,* inferior vena cava; *SVC,* superior vena cava. **Figure 35-24, cont'd**

ventricular septum, 5 to 7 mm below the edge of the septal defect. This critical point is given attention by all experienced surgeons.D8

Usual de-airing procedures are performed, and the remainder of the operation is completed as usual.

#### Repair of Doubly Committed Subarterial Ventricular Septal Defect

Transverse incision in the RV infundibulum is the classic approach for repair of doubly committed subarterial VSDsD4 (Fig. 35-26). These defects should always be closed with a patch to reduce the possibility of distorting the semilunar valves. A continuous stitch technique is employed. When pledgeted sutures are used, they are placed from just above the pulmonary valve leaflets, and pledgets come to lie in the pulmonary valve sinuses. Care is taken not to damage the left main coronary artery. An approach through the pulmonary trunk is also convenient for repairing doubly committed subarterial VSDs.

#### Repair of Inlet Septal Ventricular Septal Defect

Inlet septal (AV septal type) VSD is most easily repaired through the right atrium (see Technique of Operation in Chapter 34). Such defects are always repaired with a patch. The defect lies beneath the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve, and care is taken to avoid damage to the leaflet or its chordae and to tailor the patch such that it is not too bulky beneath the leaflet. One method of avoiding damage to the leaflet and improving exposure is to temporarily detach the base of the septal leaflet and a portion of the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve and retract the leaflet anteriorly.H20

#### Repair of Muscular Ventricular Septal Defect

A right-sided approach is used for repair of muscular VSDs. Left ventriculotomy provides excellent exposure,A1 and although it has been reported not to be disadvantageous in infants,M6,S13 it can produce ventricular aneurysm and important LV dysfunction early and late postoperatively.G12 Therefore, use of left ventriculotomy is not recommended. Defects in the lower part of the muscular septum may be obscured by trabeculations and thus difficult to visualize, resulting in incomplete closure. Wollenek and colleagues found that an apical left ventriculotomy was a useful approach in 23 patients, and in follow-up over 3 to 18 years (mean 11 years), echocardiography showed no residual VSD, normal LV shortening, no regional wall motion abnormality, and small LV aneurysm in only two patients.W8

Single or multiple muscular defects in the inlet and trabecular septum (see Figs. 35-1 and 35-12) are approached through the right atrium. When a single defect is slitlike or oval, direct suture (often in part at least with pledgeted mattress sutures) is satisfactory, but when it is large and circular, a patch is used. A cluster of defects can be closed with a single patch or individually.

Division of RV trabeculations can aid exposure of the defects, which may be difficult to close because of multiple

sites of jet penetration. A heavy traction stitch passed through the defect and back through the left side of the defect may improve exposure. A single patch of autologous pericardium supported by pledget-reinforced sutures covering an extensive portion of the trabecular septum is useful when there are multiple defects.S25 Kitagawa and colleagues described resection of trabeculations to expose the defect and attaching an oversized patch to the left side of the ventricular septum by sutures passed through the septum from the left side.K18 They also described placing pledget-supported sutures through the rim of an anterior muscular defect, passing the sutures to the outside and tying down on the epicardial surface.5

When a muscular VSD coexists with a perimembranous VSD, a single patch may be used to avoid damaging the bundle of His.

Stitches are passed through a patch (knitted double-velour polyester, polytetrafluoroethylene, or pericardium) that is slightly larger than VSD. Each stitch in this area must be placed with aortic valve in view to avoid damaging its cusps. Cardioplegic solution may be infused into aortic root for better visualization of aortic valve while placing stitches in this area. **D,** Remainder of defect is closed by placing stitches through rim of VSD and through patch.

are also approached through the right atrium.S7 The defect is converted into a single LV orifice by detaching the lower end of the trabecula septomarginalis and moderator band from the septum and retracting them (see Fig. 35-12). The VSD is closed with a patch. The trabecula septomarginalis then falls back into place.

Multiple defects in the anterior portion of the septum may be closed through a high transverse ventriculotomy. At times, VSDs may be considered too numerous to close individually; these VSDs are simply compressed and often totally closed by interrupted mattress sutures between a felt strip on the anterior ventricular wall (away from the left anterior descending coronary artery) and pledgets inside the RV and inferior to the VSDs.B14 This repair may be done from the right atrium or through a right ventriculotomy.

Apical muscular VSDs can be exposed through the right atrium and tricuspid valve or through a low vertical right ventriculotomy.S25 This can be extended around the apex for a short distance onto the posterior wall.

The rare Swiss cheese septum, with features resembling ventricular noncompaction (spongy ventricular septum) and defects involving all components of the ventricular septum, may not be correctable through the right side. Its repair requires an LV approach, and a patch over the entire muscular septum may be necessary. An associated perimembranous defect should be repaired through the right atrium because its repair from the LV side increases risk of heart block. Incisions into both ventricles are avoided whenever possible. Great care is used in making and closing the left ventriculotomy incision so as not to damage coronary artery branches. A continuous mattress suture over fine polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) felt strips plus an over-and-over stitch give a secure closure. Mace and colleagues used a right atrial approach and inserted a single large patch to cover the right side of the trabecular septum, adding several intermediate fixation stitches to prevent septal bulging.M1 Regardless of the approach employed, these patients often have poor LV function after repair and may ultimately require transplantation for heart failure.K18 This group of patients may be better served by pulmonary trunk banding with the hope that some of these defects may close as a result of ventricular hypertrophy.S6

Although it is important to avoid residual shunts, multiple incisions and a prolonged search for a few small additional muscular VSDs are generally not advisable. Preoperative echocardiography should accurately delineate the size as well as position of all the defects.

#### Closure of Associated Patent Ductus Arteriosus

Dissection of the ductus arteriosus is done after establishing CPB; this reduces the risk of hemorrhage should an error in dissection occur because of exposure, which can be difficult. After establishing CPB with the perfusate temperature at about 34°C, with caval tapes still unsnugged (so the heart will not distend) and right atrial pressure at zero, the ductus is dissected. The heart must continue to beat; otherwise a large shunt will rapidly overdistend the right side of the heart and lungs as it steals from the systemic and cerebral circulation. If the heart does fibrillate, CPB flow is immediately reduced while the dissection is rapidly completed. With downward traction on the pulmonary trunkK17 (see Technique of Operation in Chapter 37), the ductus can usually be seen through its pericardial reflection and surrounding adventitial tissue. The left pulmonary artery and undersurface of the aorta—both proximal and distal to the ductus—are clearly identified to prevent these structures from being damaged or ligated after being mistaken for the ductus. The delicate pericardial reflection and adventitial tissue on both sides of the ductus are sharply dissected from it. The adventitia of the ductus itself and of the adjacent pulmonary artery and aorta must not be entered. The recurrent laryngeal nerve is not seen. Only when the dissection is complete, the left pulmonary artery visualized, and the ductus identified with absolute certainty is a right-angled clamp passed behind it to grasp the 2-0 silk ligature. One ligature, tied on the ductus while CPB flow is reduced to lower intravascular pressure, is sufficient to close it. A surgical clip may be used instead. The operation then proceeds as usual.

#### Pulmonary Trunk Banding

Banding of the pulmonary trunk may be performed through a small left anterolateral thoracotomy. However, now that pulmonary trunk banding is reserved for special situations, often to be followed by a Fontan operation (see "Pulmonary Trunk Banding" in Section II of Chapter 41) or use of a valved conduit, avoiding distortion of the pulmonary trunk bifurcation by the band is crucial. To ensure this, placement of the pulmonary trunk band via median sternotomy is the best approach because it permits accurate dissection, placement, and anchoring of the band on both the left and right sides of the pulmonary trunk.

According to *Trusler's rule*, A5,T14 in the case of patients with a two-ventricle circulation, the pulmonary trunk band is marked to a length of 20 mm, plus the number of millimeters corresponding to the child's weight in kilograms, to indicate the ultimate tightness of the band. If the banding is done for a complex cardiac anomaly with mixed circulation, the length is 24 mm plus the child's weight. A 3- to 4-mm-wide tape is used. The preferred material for the band is silicone or silicone-impregnated polyester, which minimizes erosion into the pulmonary trunk and allows easy removal.

When a left anterolateral thoracotomy is used, a small incision is made in the pericardium, generally anterior to the phrenic nerve. When a median sternotomy is used, the pericardium is opened in the midline. To minimize subsequent adhesions, the pericardial incision should be limited to the area needed to expose the great vessels. The pulmonary trunk is separated from the aorta by dissecting close to the *aorta*. A right-angled clamp is passed around and behind the aorta to grasp one end of the band and pull it through. The other end of the band is retrieved by a clamp passed through the transverse sinus. Small angiocatheters are placed in the aorta and left pulmonary artery for pressure monitoring. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may be useful during the procedure to estimate gradient across the band.

With the band now safely around the proximal portion of the pulmonary trunk, the marked points on the band are joined temporarily with a hemoclip to produce the desired circumference. With proper band tightening in patients with a two-ventricle circulation, systolic and mean blood pressures rise, but systemic oxygen saturation should remain at 100%. If systemic oxygen saturation drops below 100%, the Qp/Q s will be less than 1, and the band is too tight. The distal pulmonary artery systolic pressure should be less than 50% of systemic systolic blood pressure. In cases of complete mixing, arterial oxygen saturation will vary with band tightening and should be set at 80% to 85% by pulse oximetry with FIO2 of 50%. This implies a Qp/Q s of about 1 (see "Pulmonary Trunk Banding in Section II of Chapter 41). If bradycardia or cyanosis develops, the band must be slightly loosened by placing a hemoclip more distally and removing the initial clip. If the narrowing is insufficient, as judged by the criteria mentioned earlier, it is tightened by adding a hemoclip more proximally.

When the ideal diameter is obtained, the band is joined by sutures. It is essential that stitches be placed between the band and the pulmonary trunk adventitia to prevent migration of the band. The pericardium is loosely closed to facilitate dissection at subsequent operation.

#### Pulmonary Trunk Debanding

When a pulmonary trunk band has been properly applied for 6 months or less, simple band removal may be all that is necessary. When the band must remain in place longer, reconstruction of the pulmonary trunk is usually required.

The band can almost always be cut and removed without damaging the underlying artery. The tip of the left atrial appendage actually is more likely to be damaged, because it is always adherent to the banded area. Dissection is usually delayed until CPB has been established, when if necessary, CPB flow can be reduced to facilitate exposure and dissection.

The VSD is usually closed after repair of the pulmonary trunk. The pulmonary trunk is usually reconstructed. The most satisfactory technique is local excision of the short, narrowed, scarred segment of artery and reanastomosis of the divided pulmonary trunk using a continuous polypropylene suture.D6 This technique can usually be employed even when the band lies close to the pulmonary valve, by extending the incision vertically into the most anterior sinus between the valve commissures to enlarge the diameter of the proximal end. A similar technique can be used to enlarge an orifice stenosis involving only one branch of the pulmonary trunk. When the pulmonary valve cusps have become excessively thick, their edges may require excision. If an adequate diameter is unobtainable by the technique of excision and endto-end anastomosis, an oval-shaped patch is inserted. To adequately enlarge the stenotic area, the patch (autologous pericardium, bovine pericardium, pulmonary allograft, or thin PTFE) should extend from within the sinus of Valsalva of the pulmonary trunk proximally and across the anastomosis to the distal trunk. Extensive reconstruction (see "Repair of Tetralogy of Fallot with Bifurcation Stenosis of Pulmonary Trunk" in Section I of Chapter 38) is required when the band constricts the origin of the pulmonary arteries.

#### SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

General measures and management of complications described in Chapter 5 are used for postoperative care of patients undergoing repair of primary VSD.

Hemodynamic state typically is good early postoperatively after closure of VSD. In the unusual situation of poor hemodynamic performance, the possibility of residual left-to-right shunting must be considered, particularly if left atrial pressure is considerably higher than right atrial pressure.6 Also, the finding of a considerably higher oxygen content or saturation in blood from the pulmonary artery than that from the right atrium establishes existence of a shunt.V4 Two-dimensional Doppler color flow echocardiography can be used to settle the matter.L18 Although some shunting may occur for 12 to 24 hours after VSD closure with a porous patch, the usual cause of poor hemodynamic state from a left-to-right shunt is patch dehiscence. Thus, if the hemodynamic state is poor or a large left-to-right shunt is present, prompt reoperation is probably indicated. Intraoperative echocardiography at the original operation, if done, will usually have indicated residual shunting,S27 as confirmed by postoperative echocardiography, which may be done transesophageally for greatest resolution and quality of images.

It is prudent to place temporary pacing wires on the RV after VSD repair. Complete AV dissociation is often present for a short time intraoperatively. Even if this resolves promptly to normal sinus rhythm, it is advisable to leave pacing wires in place and have an external pacemaker available while the patient is hospitalized, because AV dissociation may occur temporarily.

#### RESULTS

#### Early (Hospital) Death

Hospital mortality is low for repair of single large VSDs, most of which are now repaired in early infancy. In the current era in experienced centers, hospital mortality for isolated VSD closure is 1% or less.S5 Risk is higher when VSDs are multiple and when major associated cardiac anomalies coexist.

#### Mode of Early Death

The most common mode of death after repair of a primary VSD is acute cardiac failure.R6 This may be related to failure of intraoperative myocardial protection in the face of myocardial dysfunction, often present in sick small patients coming to operation. Occasionally, paroxysms of pulmonary arterial hypertension (see "Pulmonary Hypertensive Crises" under Pulmonary Subsystem in Section I of Chapter 5) precipitate acute cardiac failure.S21 Persisting severe pulmonary dysfunction, often from viral pneumonitis present before operation, characterizes death of a few infants after repair of VSD.

#### Incremental Risk Factors for Hospital Death

Studies of experiences extending back a number of years permit identification of incremental risk factors. With death after repair now less common, risk factors are now more difficult to identify.

Risk of repair has decreased, and thus *early date of operation* is an incremental risk factor.S20,S22,S28 Improvement from an original risk of hospital death of 20% began in the experience at the Mayo Clinic during the early 1960s. This type of improvement has been demonstrated in other centers.C18,R7

In previous eras, *young age* increased the risk of operation.R7,Y4 However, in the current era at experienced centers, this risk factor has been neutralized.J5,S5 Young age may still be an incremental risk factor when major associated anomalies coexist.

*Multiple VSDs* increased risk of operation in the past,F1,F7,K12 but risk has declined considerably in the current era. However, multiple VSDs complicated by additional cardiac anomalies impose a higher risk of hospital death than do uncomplicated ones.R7 This again may not be an immutable risk and may be improved by better myocardial management, avoidance of ventricular incisions, and device closure.S7

When the two ventricles have equal stroke volumes (i.e., no shunts or valvar regurgitation are present), left and right atrial pressures are determined by the relative contractility, distensibility, and volume at zero pressure of the two ventricles.B7 The greater each of these values is for a given ventricle, the better its performance and the lower its end-diastolic and (if the AV valves are not stenotic) atrial pressures tend to be relative to those of the other ventricle. (For a more detailed discussion of these matters, see "Cardiac Output and Its Determinants" in Section I of Chapter 5.) After complete repair of a large VSD through the right atrium in a patient who preoperatively had a large left-to-right shunt and a large Qp/Q s , the atrial pressures are similar, or right is slightly higher than left. When repair is through a right ventriculotomy, right atrial pressure may be 20% to 30% higher than left. Unless repair has been done through a left ventriculotomy and in the absence of other left heart lesions (e.g., aortic stenosis, coarctation), a left atrial pressure considerably greater than right (>6 mm Hg) suggests a residual left-to-right shunt. The high left atrial pressure under such circumstances is related to large LV stroke volume.

Major associated cardiac anomalies increased risk of hospital death in the past and continue to do so to some extent, particularly when they are associated with multiple VSDs. Coexisting PDA and coarctation of the aorta have not increased risk of repair of VSD to the extent that occurs with more serious anomalies such as congenital mitral valve disease. Again, better surgical techniques for managing complex anomalies and current methods of myocardial management (see Chapter 3) may neutralize much of the increased risk formerly imposed by major associated cardiac anomalies.

Neither location of the VSD nor surgical approach affects risk of operation. Previous pulmonary trunk banding and associated lesions (e.g., aortic regurgitation, sinus of Valsalva aneurysm) likewise do not increase surgical risk.

Preoperative PPA and Rp are not determinants of early mortality at present, although they affect late results. B10 This current situation is different from earlier experiences, C4,C15 no doubt because the upper limit of operable Rp is better understood, and perioperative management (including surgical techniques and myocardial management) has improved.

#### Survival

Premature late death occurs in less than 2.5% of patients when Rp is low preoperatively. Presumably, the few deaths in this setting are from arrhythmias, either ventricular fibrillation or sudden development of heart block late postoperatively. Patients with a high Rp preoperatively often die from progression of pulmonary vascular disease.

Repair of VSD during the first 1 or 2 years of life is curative for most patients, resulting in full functional activity and normal or near-normal life expectancy.

#### Physical Development

A prominent feature of the late postoperative course after repair of large VSDs in infants is improved physical development, and an impressive increase in weight may also be seen, as Lillehei and colleagues first showed in 1955. There is a less impressive increase in length and head circumference. Cl4 This improved physical development is usually associated with complete relief of symptoms. Postoperative weight increase also occurs in children in whom a large VSD is repaired later in the first decade of life Cl4 (Fig. 35-27).

These generalizations were refined by Weintraub and Menahem in a definitive study. W5 They confirmed that repair of a large VSD in the first 6 months of life results in nearnormal long-term growth in most patients, so that by age 5 years, weight, length, and head circumference are normal. Low-birth-weight infants were an exception, and catch-up occurred only in their weight.

#### Conduction Disturbances

Conduction disturbances are frequent after repair of VSDs.

#### Right Bundle Branch Block

Right bundle branch block (RBBB) is present late postoperatively in many patients in whom VSDs are repaired via right ventriculotomy. In one series of infants, prevalence was 80% (CL 72%-86%). Based on their studies, Gelband and colleagues concluded that the cause is the ventriculotomy. GE However, Weidman and colleagues at Mayo Clinic reported

![](_page_28_Figure_15.jpeg)

**Figure 35-27** Changes in weight after repair of ventricular septal defect in 96 patients aged 10 years or less, with ratio of pulmonary and systemic pressures greater than 0.45 and ratio of pulmonary and systemic resistances less than 0.75 preoperatively. (From Cartmill and colleagues.<sup>C4</sup>)

that 44% (CL 35%-54%) of 36 patients undergoing repair of perimembranous VSDs through a right atriotomy developed new RBBB. Of Rein and colleagues reported RBBB in 34% (CL 26%-43%) of infants undergoing repair via right atriotomy. Thus, in some patients, RBBB must result from damage to the right bundle by sutures along the inferior border of perimembranous VSDs. In any event, RBBB is less prevalent when the right atrial approach is used for VSD repair. H18,O6 Although an adverse effect on late ventricular function has not been established, at least one study has associated RBBB with increased risk of late diastolic dysfunction. P4

#### Right Bundle Branch Block and Left Anterior Hemiblock

A small proportion of patients develop the ECG pattern of RBBB and left anterior hemiblock after repair of VSD. Prevalence was 8% (CL 4%-14%) in patients repaired through right ventriculotomy and 10% (CL 6%-16%) in another group of 68 patients. Z2 Prevalence was 17% (CL 11%-25%) in Rein and colleagues' patients repaired via right atriotomy and 12% (CL 7%-19%) in Lincoln and colleagues' patients, 72% of whom were repaired through the right atrium. L15 Such a combination of disturbances has not yet proved to be a poor prognostic finding, but concern and some controversy have been expressed. K25,Z2 Wolff and colleagues reported that this combination was associated with important development of late complete heart block and sudden death after repair of tetralogy of Fallot.W7 However, Downing and colleagues, who found this combination in 6% (CL 4%-10%) of 109 patients undergoing repair of isolated VSD, observed no late complications of any kind in patients followed 1 to 10 years.<sup>D9</sup> The controversy may relate in part to heterogeneity<sup>\$24</sup>; that is, RBBB can result from damage to the main right bundle branch during repair, in which case its combination with left anterior hemiblock might be more hazardous than when RBBB results from disruption of a peripheral branch of the right bundle arborization secondary to a right ventriculotomy. K23 Intracardiac recording techniques at cardiac catheterization may distinguish between these two groups and be helpful prognostically. S29

Key: *LVEF,* Left ventricular ejection fraction; *LV,* left ventricle; *Preop,* preoperative; *Postop,* postoperative. (From Cordell and colleagues.<sup>C20</sup>)

#### Ventricular Arrhythmias

Serious ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death late after repair of VSDs have been rare. In a group of children aged 4 to 5 years at repair of the VSD, ventricular premature beats were identified by Holter monitoring late postoperatively in about 40%. H18 All patients were asymptomatic, and no instances of ventricular tachycardia were observed. Prevalence was lower when an atrial rather than a ventricular approach to repair had been used and also in patients who were younger at time of repair.

#### Permanent Heart Block

Occurrence of permanent heart block (complete atrioventricular dissociation, with independent atrial activity not conducted to the ventricles) after repair of single VSD approaches zero with present techniques. Prevalence is slightly higher in patients undergoing repair of multiple VSDs. Inlet VSDs extending posteriorly to the crux, associated with straddling tricuspid valve, also have increased prevalence of heart block after repair.

#### Cardiac Function

Late postoperative cardiac function is essentially normal when repair is done during the first 2 years of life by modern techniques through the right atrium or RV<sup>C20,J2,J3</sup> (Fig. 35-28). Others have found persisting abnormalities of LV size and function after repair of large VSDs at an older age, although all patients were asymptomatic. M5 This information suggests that in general, patients with large VSDs should be operated on before they reach 2 years of age, preferably during the first year of life.

Experience with LV function after left ventriculotomy for repairing VSDs in infants has been sobering; in some patients, cardiac output has been low and left atrial pressure high despite absence of a shunt. False aneurysm has occurred after closure of VSD through a left ventriculotomy.

#### Residual Shunting

Postoperative left-to-right shunts large enough to require reoperation are uncommon when proper techniques are used. In experienced centers, reoperation for residual VSD should be 2% or less. B10,S5

Small but hemodynamically unimportant residual VSDs cannot be entirely ignored; theoretically, the possibility of infective endocarditis at such sites exists. Accurate estimation of their prevalence would require routine postoperative left ventriculography, however, and this has not been done. With near-routine intra- and postoperative assessment of cardiac

repairs by echocardiography, detection of even small residual defects late after operation is uncommon.H3 Among early residual defects of less than 2 mm detected by echocardiography, greater than 80% are undetectable at 1 year.D7

#### Pulmonary Hyperinflation Syndrome

When pulmonary hyperinflation syndrome is present in infants before VSD repair, it usually resolves within 1 to 2 months after repair.O2

#### Surgically Produced Aortic or Tricuspid Regurgitation

As complications of repair of primary VSD, surgically produced aortic and tricuspid regurgitation are rare.

Rarity of surgically induced tricuspid regurgitation is surprising considering how often abnormal chordae are attached around the defect. Aortic valve regurgitation occurring after patch closure of doubly committed subarterial VSD may be a special problem. Tomita and colleagues reported that aortic valve regurgitation was detected by echocardiography in 6 of 23 patients (26%; CL16%-39%) having neither aortic valve prolapse nor regurgitation before operation.T11 Aortic valve regurgitation in these patients was silent and asymptomatic.

#### Pulmonary Hypertension

When severe pulmonary hypertension persists after operation, it may worsen with passage of time and may cause premature late death.D10,F6,H2 About 25% of patients with preoperative pulmonary hypertension and high Rp (at least 10 units · m2 ) die with pulmonary hypertension within 5 years of operationB10 (Fig. 35-29). However, some patients with pulmonary hypertension and elevated Rp late postoperatively have neither progression nor regression of their disease for as long as 20 years, although they have some limitation in exercise tolerance.D10,H1

In general, the younger the child at time of repair, the better are the chances of surviving and having an essentially normal PPA 5 years and more laterC5,D10,H14,L13,M4,S10,Y2 (Fig. 35-30). The lower the Rp at repair, the better the chances of having normal pressure late postoperatively (Fig. 35-31). These two factors, age and preoperative Rp, interact in determining late postoperative PPA.

A more specific correlate of survival and good outcome in patients with important preoperative pulmonary hypertension is preoperative response to infusion of a pulmonary vascular dilator such as isoproterenol.L21,M12,N5 Generally, outcome is good in patients of all ages when preoperative Rp is only mildly or moderately elevated (<8 units · m2 ; see Table 35-3). Outcome is good in patients with severely elevated Rp only

Dashed lines enclose 70% confidence limits. Analysis is based on data of DuShane and Kirklin.D10 Natural history is also shown, with vertical axis the probability of long-term survival and ultimate spontaneous closure of the defect and horizontal axis the age at observation of a patient with a large VSD.

when it drops below 7.0 units · m2 with preoperative infusion of isoproterenol.N5 Sodium nitroprusside infusion or nitric oxide may also be used and has the advantage of not producing tachycardia.

#### Surgical Cure

Combining data on PPA late postoperatively with the proportion of patients dying early and late postoperatively, chances of "surgical cure" (defined as surviving the early postoperative period and being alive late postoperatively with essentially normal PPA) can be estimated for an individual patient (Fig. 35-32). If repair of a large VSD is performed in a patient at 6 months of age, there is at least a 95% chance of surgical cure, unless preoperative Rp is greater than about 8 units · m2 and does not fall to less than 7 units · m2 with infusion of isoproterenol (which is rare at that age). This is supported by studies by Rabinovitch and colleagues, in which it was also found that surgical cure is likely to result in any infant in whom the VSD is repaired before age 6 to 9 months, irrespective of degree of pulmonary vascular disease.R1 In a 2-year-old patient, chances of cure are this good only if preoperative Rp is less than about 5 units · m2 . In a patient operated on for repair of large VSD at age 4 years, chances are that good only if Rp is normal preoperatively (which is unusual). This unfavorable effect of older age has been confirmed by John and colleagues.J4 This finding supports the practice of repair of large defects at least by age 12 months and can be used to predict results of operation in individual patients.

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

In earlier eras, great emphasis was placed on details of calculated Rp and Qp/Q s in determining appropriate timing of surgical intervention or whether continued observation was advisable. In the current era in which hospital mortality after surgical closure of isolated VSD approaches 1% or less, and the majority of infants and children undergo transthoracic echocardiography (without cardiac catheterization) as the definitive diagnostic study, the decision-making process has evolved away from these hemodynamic measurements.

Decisions regarding operation vary somewhat among experienced institutions, but generally relate to size of the defect as assessed echocardiographically (see "Two-Dimensional Echocardiography" under Clinical Features and Diagnostic Criteria), morphologic characteristics related to likelihood of spontaneous closure (see Fig. 35-32), estimated Rp, and presence or absence of Down syndrome.

Infants with an isolated large VSD are rarely truly asymptomatic in the absence of elevated Rp, which results in lower Qp . In addition to overt signs of heart failure or failure to thrive, the experienced pediatric cardiologist will note subtle signs of failure such as isolated tachypnea or decrease in the slope of the growth curve even with adequate feeding. Left atrial enlargement detected echocardiographically supports the presence of LV volume overload secondary to increased Qp . In the presence of a large defect and absence of such symptoms or signs, specific echocardiographic interrogation for signs of elevated Rp or associated obstructive lesions in the RV outflow tract is warranted. In infants with a large VSD and major symptoms of heart failure or failure to thrive, operation is advisable irrespective of age. In the presence of mild symptoms, elective repair of isolated large VSD is advisable during the first 6 months of life or at the time of diagnosis if older. Infants with Down syndrome and large VSD are likely at increased risk for developing pulmonary vascular disease; therefore, operation should be undertaken within the first few months of life.

Infants with a moderate or large perimembranous VSD associated with aneurysm of the membranous system or a VSD partially covered by accessory tricuspid valve tissue have increased likelihood of spontaneous closure, and operation can be deferred for 6 to 12 months in the absence of symptoms, with planned reevaluation for signs of decreasing size. A VSD of moderate size still carries an ongoing risk of pulmonary vascular disease, and surgical closure is recommended by 12 months of age (or at the time of diagnosis if older) unless there are signs of decreasing defect size. Appearance of decreasing flow velocity in the absence of decreasing size suggests increasing Rp, although such findings may appear transiently in the face of bronchiolitis or other self-limited reasons for increased Rp. If increasing Rp is identified, prompt surgical closure is advisable.

Exceptions to this general practice are made for rare infants with Swiss cheese septum, who present a special problem because of higher risk of surgery. In this setting during the first 3 months of life, pulmonary trunk banding may be indicated; when there are no complications from the band, repair of the Swiss cheese septum and debanding are postponed until age 2 to 4 years. This general plan is also followed when Swiss cheese septum coexists with coarctation of the aorta. Other exceptions to primary repair during the first 3 months of life include infants with straddling tricuspid valve.

In patients with evidence of important elevation of Rp by echocardiography, cardiac catheterization is advisable.K14 When Rp is truly and precisely measured at preoperative cardiac catheterization and is only mildly or moderately elevated (<8 units · m2 ), operation can be undertaken with near certainty that the early and late outcome will be goodN5 (Fig. 35-33). Such patients usually have a large Qp/Q s.

Responders experienced a fall in resistance to less than 7 units  $\cdot$  m<sup>2</sup>; nonresponders did not. Key: *Rp*, Pulmonary vascular resistance. (From Neutze and colleagues.<sup>N5</sup>)

When Rp is severely elevated (>8 units  $\cdot$  m²), pulmonary vasodilator challenge is performed during cardiac catheterization (ensuring adequate ventilation or hyperventilation, 100% inspired oxygen, plus nitric oxide or other specific pulmonary vasodilator), and Rp is remeasured. If it falls to 7 units  $\cdot$  m² or less, the response is considered favorable and operation is advised (Fig. 35-34). Otherwise, closure of the VSD is

inadvisable. In fact, VSD closure under these circumstances would prevent right-to-left shunting during exercise, resulting in a lower exercise capacity and life expectancy with the defect closed than with it open.

In older patients, operation is generally advisable with a  $\dot{Q}p/\dot{Q}s$  above 1.5 in the absence of additional major operative risk factors. However, in patients with a large VSD, a  $\dot{Q}p/\dot{Q}s$  of 1.5 to 1.8 at rest that becomes 1.0 or less during moderate exercise (from systemic peripheral vasodilatation, increased  $\dot{Q}s$ , and a fixed and high Rp preventing increased  $\dot{Q}p$ ) is an indication of probable inoperability. An important fall in SaO<sub>2</sub> during exercise (from right-to-left shunting across the VSD for the reasons described) also suggests inoperability, but a more complete investigation with determination of response to nitric oxide is required for a final decision. Response of Rp to inhalation of mixtures high in oxygen alone is not useful in determining operability in borderline situations.

Children with small VSDs can be safely observed unless other cardiac anomalies (e.g., aortic regurgitation from aortic cusp prolapse, subaortic stenosis, subpulmonary stenosis) are observed. Periodic reevaluation is advisable to verify that observed clinical and echocardiographic findings are compatible with safe continued observation.

Doubly committed subarterial and juxta-aortic VSDs constitute a special situation. R4 Even though apparently small, they should not be left untreated if there is any aortic cusp deformity on 2D echocardiography or cineangiography; development of aortic regurgitation must be prevented (see Section II). These defects should be repaired promptly if an aortic diastolic murmur develops.

#### SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

#### Ventricular Septal Defect and Patent Ductus Arteriosus

Combination of large VSD and moderate-sized or large PDA is particularly likely to cause severe symptoms and require operation early in infancy. During the first 6 to 8 weeks of life in patients with a very large ductus and only a moderate-sized or small VSD, the PDA alone may be repaired because the VSD may narrow or close spontaneously. If this does not occur, the VSD is closed at an appropriate time. When the VSD is large, both it and the PDA are closed simultaneously if operation is required in early life. Risk of operation should not be higher than that for isolated VSD.

#### Ventricular Septal Defect and Coarctation of Aorta

Combination of VSD and aortic coarctation frequently causes severe symptoms in infancy. Both coarctation and VSD are variable in severity. Clearly, the worst combination is a large VSD and severe coarctation, but even a small VSD in association with important coarctation may produce heart failure early in life. <sup>T9</sup>

Management options for this combination of defects include simultaneous repair of both lesions, T8 sequential single-stage repair through separate incisions, K25,K26 initial repair of the coarctation alone, N3 initial coarctation repair and pulmonary trunk banding, or initial VSD closure alone. With a large VSD and severe coarctation, repairing the VSD first has certain theoretic advantages B9 but has been practiced

rarely under such circumstances. *Repair of the coarctation only* as the initial operation has the advantage of reducing afterload on the LV and, theoretically at least, reducing shunt through the defect. It also avoids a second operation if the VSD closes spontaneously.N3 Mortality with repair of aortic coarctation in this setting has been high in the past,N3 but more recent experience has been good.M3,P2 The results have also been good with *initial coarctation repair with pulmonary trunk banding*.

Simultaneous repair of both the coarctation and a large VSD in early infancy in the current era in experienced institutions carries a low risk, with hospital mortality of about 5%.G4,W3 The operation is generally performed via a median sternotomy and combined regional perfusion and circulatory arrest. Alternatively, the operation can be performed as a single stage with repair of coarctation through a left thoracotomy followed by repair of a VSD via median sternotomy using standard CPB. Kanter and colleagues have reported excellent survival with this method.K1,K2 In the current era, the following practice can be recommended:

- 1. When the VSD is large, the coarctation is severe, and the infant presents with severe heart failure, a singlestage repair of coarctation and VSD is advisable, using one of the techniques described previously. When multiple VSDs or Swiss cheese septum is present, the pulmonary trunk is banded, and debanding and repair are delayed if possible until the patient is about age 3 years.
- 2. When the coarctation is severe and VSD small or moderate-sized, only the coarctation is repaired, and subsequent repair of the VSD is performed according to standard indications.
- 3. When the coarctation is moderately severe and VSD large, the VSD may be repaired initially and the coarctation repaired either at the same operation or as a second procedure within a few months. Techniques of CPB are standard, with perfusion of the lower body satisfactory in this situation.

#### Pulmonary Trunk Banding

Civin and Edwards noted good prognosis and freedom from pulmonary vascular disease in patients with single ventricle and moderate pulmonary stenosis.C13 Based on that observation, Muller and Dammann performed pulmonary trunk banding in 1952.M16 For many years thereafter, this procedure was used by many for infants who required operation for large VSD, thereby allowing deferral of the intracardiac repair until an older age.M9,O7,P3

For several reasons, banding is seldom indicated for primary isolated large VSDs. Hospital mortality of patients with pulmonary trunk banding has been substantial, and a second operation, which carries additional mortality, is always required.G8,H6,H21 Early mortality is independent of type of VSD. It is difficult to adjust the tightness of the band perfectly, and reentry a few days later may be needed to modify the tightness. Furthermore, good palliation is not always achieved by banding, and there may be important intermediate mortality before second-stage repair. Complications result from banding in some patients, including development of infundibular and valvar pulmonary stenosis, subaortic stenosis,F3 and migration of the band to the pulmonary trunk bifurcation (Fig. 35-35). Although hospital

Width of pulmonary band is indicated by two arrows as well as by its migration to bifurcation. Key: *LPA,* Left pulmonary artery; *PT,* pulmonary trunk; *RPA,* right pulmonary artery.

mortality from pulmonary trunk debanding and VSD repair is low, combined mortality of the banding procedure and subsequent debanding and VSD closure is at least as high as primary VSD repair. Furthermore, restenosis of the pulmonary trunk may follow debanding and VSD repair, necessitating a third operation.K11

Pulmonary trunk banding as an initial palliative procedure in very young or very small patients with refractory heart failure may still be appropriate in some centers.S2 For a number of years, however, there have been only two standard indications for pulmonary trunk banding in infants with primary VSD: (1) severe heart failure from Swiss cheese septum and (2) associated severe coarctation of the aorta and severe heart failure during the first few months of life. The second is no longer an indication for banding.

#### Right Atrial versus Right Ventricular Approach for Perimembranous Ventricular Septal Defect

The RV approach may be used for repair of perimembranous VSDs and results in low hospital mortality even in patients with high Rp. The RV approach has the advantage that the nadir of the noncoronary cusp of the aortic valve, which is the area of the right trigone and bundle of His, can be accurately visualized, which may be helpful in choosing the suture technique that will minimize prevalence of heart block (see Fig. 35-25). The RV approach has the disadvantages of (1) leaving a scar in the RV, (2) being associated with a higher prevalence of complete RBBB than with an atrial approach, and (3) possibly resulting in more ventricular arrhythmias late postoperatively.

The right atrial approach may be used almost exclusively, a practice begun in about 1960 at the Mayo Clinic.C4 An accurate repair can be obtained through a right atrial approach in nearly all cases. Associated infundibular pulmonary stenosis can be excised. An RV scar is avoided, and occurrence of RBBB is lower than with the transventricular approach.H11 With the right atrial approach, however, techniques must be accurate to avoid damaging the tricuspid valve leaflets or chordae.

#### Closure of Ventricular Septal Defect Through Less Invasive Approaches

Smaller incisions (less invasive approaches) have been used for closure of VSDs.B16,L14 Although it is technically feasible to close a VSD successfully through a variety of these techniques, no advantages have been demonstrated other than the smaller incision.A15

#### Percutaneous Closure of Ventricular Septal Defects

In selected cases, especially in patients with complex cardiac anomalies (e.g., multiple muscular VSDs) and those with overlooked VSDs after surgical repair of a large defect, transcatheter closure of the VSD by a percutaneously placed double umbrella can be considered.B15,L16 This may be particularly advantageous in apical muscular defects.K26 This method in general should be considered only when surgery is contraindicated or has unusually high risks and when suitable skill and equipment are available.

A current perception is that primary multiple muscular VSDs, particularly those near the apex, are more suitably closed by a percutaneous catheter technique than by operation. This remains unproven, however, particularly for multiple muscular VSDs that can be closed from the right atrium after taking down the trabecula septomarginalis.P2 The technique is a promising one, but additional experience and information are required for definitive evaluation.

These devices may also be deployed intraoperatively.A7,G1,M17,Q1

#### Closure of Ventricular Septal Defect When Pulmonary Resistance Is High

Patients with VSD in which pulmonary hypertension is severe, with PPA at or above systemic blood pressure, have traditionally been thought to be inoperable because of the high risk of operation. Zhou and colleagues reported use of unidirectional valve patch closure of cardiac septal defects with severe pulmonary hypertension.Z1 There was a VSD in 22 of 24 patients in the series, all with marked elevation of PPA (80 ± 12 mm Hg) and increased Qp/Q s (1.1 ± 0.11). SaO2 was reduced to 88% ± 4%. The patch consisted of polyester fabric with a 0.5- to 1.0-cm hole covered by a pericardial patch left open at one side to function as a one-way valve, placed on the systemic side of the defect. Two patients died after operation (8.3%). PPA fell to 56 ± 19 mm Hg and Qp/Q s to 0.7 ± 0.1, while SaO2 rose to 96% ± 1%. Excellent improvement of functional state was noted. These results were corroborated by Ad and colleagues while claiming earlier right of discovery of this method (see Fig. 30-26 in Chapter 30).A2,A3,A4

## **Section II Ventricular Septal Defect and Aortic Regurgitation**

#### DEFINITION

Ventricular septal defect and aortic regurgitation (VSD-AR) syndrome includes hearts in which AR is of congenital origin, although rarely present at birth, and caused by cusp prolapse or a bicuspid aortic valve.K5 The VSD is doubly committed subarterial, perimembranous (with outlet extension or simply juxta-aortic), or rarely, outlet muscular. These locations are in fact a continuum, with the subarterial VSD lying farthest to the patient's left (and anteriorly), the perimembranous VSD with outlet extension lying more rightward (and slightly inferior) than the subarterial, and the perimembranous juxta-aortic VSD lying still more rightward (and inferiorly).

VSD-AR syndrome is related to congenital sinus of Valsalva aneurysm (see Chapter 36) and tetralogy of Fallot with AR (see Chapter 38).

#### HISTORICAL NOTE

Initial description of VSD-AR syndrome due to aortic cusp prolapse is attributed to Laubry and Pezzi's publication in 1921.L3 First reports of operative correction were those of Garamella and Starr and their colleagues in 1960.G2,S23

Experience at Mayo Clinic began about the same time.K6 On review of this experience in 1963, of the 30 patients in whom the aortic valve cusps were reconstructed and repaired, 10 (33%; CL 24%-44%) still had important AR.E5 This and other reports in which results of cusp reconstruction were equally unsatisfactoryT4 led to adoption of aortic valve replacement using either an allograftG10 or prosthetic valve. During this period, operations were delayed beyond childhood whenever possible to avoid valve replacement at a young age. Renewed interest in use of cusp reconstruction dates from publications of Spencer and Trusler and their colleagues in 1973, which followed the work of Frater.F2,S18,T13

Tatsuno and colleagues in Japan have done much to elucidate the nature of the anomaly and document the good results obtained by VSD closure alone when AR is mild.T5,T6,T7

#### MORPHOLOGY AND MORPHOGENESIS

Perimembranous VSDs are most prevalent among predominantly white patients with VSD and AR.L7,M2 Among Asians with VSD and AR, VSDs are more prevalent in the RV outlet, particularly doubly committed subarterial VSDs.H8,O5 Rarely, the defect may be a muscular outlet (also called "intracristal") defect in which the superior rim is formed by the remnant of a deficient subpulmonary infundibulum. The posteroinferior margin of the defect is formed by fusion of the posteroinferior rim of the trabecula septomarginalis with the ventriculoinfundibular fold.A8 AR is most often caused by prolapse of the right cusp of the aortic valve (about two thirds of patients); the remaining third have prolapse of the noncoronary cusp or of both noncoronary and right coronary cusps, with about equal prevalence. The common feature of all these defects associated with AR is that the affected cusp or cusps lack the normal muscular support provided by attachment of the sinus of Valsalva to the muscular ventricular septum. Infrequently, no cusp is prolapsing, but the aortic valve is bicuspid and regurgitant.

Variable degrees of RV outflow obstruction are present in many patients. The infundibular septum may be underdeveloped and displaced anteriorly and leftwardV1 (malaligned as in tetralogy of Fallot), a feature responsible for mild infundibular stenosis that may be present. Occasionally, RV trabeculae near the junction of the infundibular septum and free wall may contribute to infundibular stenosis, as may hypertrophy of the moderator band at a lower level. Typical lowlying infundibular pulmonary stenosis (double-chambered RV) accounts for the gradient in some patients.K4

The aortic root and valve exhibit a variety of anomalies. Cusps may prolapse not only into but at times through the VSD. Protrusion through the VSD increases during diastole and effectively plugs the defect, limiting the shunt even when the defect is large. Extensive cusp prolapse through a large VSD can also produce some obstruction to RV outflow. In advanced cases, the center of the prolapsed free margin of the cusp is thickened and retracted, a feature that makes resuspension of the leaflet less effective.A16 Some patients have additional damage produced by endocarditis.

The sinus of Valsalva adjacent to the prolapsed leaflet is enlarged, often considerably. This enlarged sinus is associated with asymmetric splaying and dilatation of the aortic "anulus," a feature aggravated by severe AR and volume changes in the LV. It is virtually impossible to distinguish the junction between the prolapsed cusp and dilated sinus at cineangiography and at times at operation. The wall of the enlarged sinus may be thinned and aneurysmal adjacent to the cusp hinge line and rarely may protrude into the RV immediately above the prolapsed cusp. Such a finding indicates the close similarity between this condition and that of ruptured congenital sinus of Valsalva aneurysm with VSD.

#### Mechanism of Aortic Regurgitation

The mechanism for cusp prolapse remains speculative; multiple theories have been proposed. Prolapse may result in part from lack of support of the aortic sinus of Valsalva and "anulus" by the infundibular septum,T6,V1 although because most large perimembranous defects are closely adjacent to the aortic "anulus" and very few have associated regurgitation, this cannot be the entire explanation.S1 A structural

![](_page_35_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Figure 35-36** Proposed pathophysiology of aortic regurgitation in ventricular septal defect (VSD) with aortic regurgitation by Venturi effect. *Top,* As fluid passes through conduits of varying diameter, changes in velocity and pressure occur. As caliber of the conduit decreases, fluid velocity increases and pressure decreases. *Bottom,* This low-pressure zone within a restrictive VSD can affect adjacent cusp of aortic valve. (From Tweddell and colleagues.T16)

defect in the base of the sinus itself may also play a role, particularly when the VSD is small.E2 Loss of continuity of the aortic media from the aortic "anulus" and the ventricular septum has also been proposed.Y1 Hemodynamic influences during both systole and diastole aggravate the tendencies toward AR.T6 Such influences are more marked once AR develops, resulting in progressive prolapse and distortion.

The most widely accepted predominant mechanism of cusp prolapse is the *Venturi effect*, K9 which describes changes in velocity and pressure that occur when fluid passes through conduits of varying diameter. As conduit caliber decreases, fluid velocity increases and pressure decreases. If there is restriction to flow through a VSD and an aortic valve cusp is adjacent to the defect, it is vulnerable to being drawn into the high-velocity, low-pressure jetT5 as blood shunts left to right through the restrictive VSD (Fig. 35-36). This tends to displace the unsupported "anulus" outward and downward into the RV. Later in systole, the aortic cusp prolapses into the VSD and is acted upon by direct pressure from the cavity of the LV, displacing both "anulus" and cusp into the RV. During diastole, the high pressure in the aortic root distends the dilated sinus, with further displacement of the aortic "anulus" toward the RV. As the sinus dilates, the distending force becomes greater from increase in wall tension.

Observations supporting the Venturi effect as the predominant cause of aortic cusp prolapse and subsequent AR include:

■ The Venturi effect requires a restrictive VSD. Previous studies in the era of near-routine cardiac catheterization indicate that with occasional exceptions, most such defects are restrictive, and PPA is usually near normal.C7,C11,K21,L20 In a study from Taiwan, Chiu and colleagues found that among patients who developed aortic valve prolapse, mean Qp/Q s for perimembranous VSDs was 1.7; for subarterial defects, 1.6; and for muscular outlet VSDs, 1.45.C11

- There appears to be a minimum shunt size required to induce sufficient cusp distortion for development of prolapse. The lower limit of Qp/Q s among patients with VSD and aortic valve prolapse or AR appears to be about 1.4.C11,R4,T10
- AR in association with VSD is an acquired lesion. AR or prolapse with VSD is not present at birth and is rarely diagnosed in infancy.C11,T15
- The nadir of the affected leaflet would be expected to lie within the stream of the shunt. This is consistent with observations that overriding of the involved cusp is commonly noted,C11 and override of the aortic cusp in perimembranous VSDs has been identified as a risk factor for developing cusp prolapse and subsequent AR.E1

#### CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

Potential for development of AR can be assessed by noting the possible presence of aortic cusp prolapse at echocardiography or cineangiography. Studies in such patients should include 2D echocardiography with Doppler flow velocity evaluation. Anatomic relationships of the aortic valve and VSD should be easily demonstrated. AR is estimated qualitatively. Aortic root dimensions are measured accurately. Usually, echocardiography provides sufficient information on which to base clinical decisions.

In some patients, it is desirable to have cardiac catheterization, which should include (1) right-sided heart catheterization (for calculating shunt and measuring pressures in the pulmonary artery and RV), (2) right ventriculography (for studying possible infundibular pulmonary stenosis), (3) left ventriculography (for identifying location and size of VSD), and (4) aortography (for estimating magnitude of AR and morphology of aortic root). Finding a normal aortic root diameter without cusp prolapse suggests that AR is caused by a bicuspid valve and may not be amenable to repair. Anatomic size of the VSD cannot be demonstrated angiographically when, as often occurs, it is occluded throughout the cardiac cycle by the prolapsed aortic cusp.

In patients with mild AR (e.g., younger patients), signs of the VSD dominate the clinical picture, but as AR increases, the shunt decreases.P6 Such patients characteristically have a to-and-fro murmur that may simulate the continuous murmur of PDA, but occasionally may be mistaken for that of isolated AR or combined AR and stenosis.

#### NATURAL HISTORY

Among all patients with VSD, the prevalence of aortic valve prolapse and AR is reported to be 4% to 9% and 2% to 6%, respectively.N1 Prevalence is also related to type of VSD. The reported prevalence of aortic cusp prolapse in subarterial VSD exceeds 40%,T5 with over half demonstrating progression of AR. Eroglu and colleagues reported a prevalence of aortic cusp prolapse of 12% and aortic regurgitation of 7% among patients with perimembranous VSD.E7 Aortic cusp prolapse and AR are more frequently reported with VSD among Asian populationsT3 because of the greater prevalence of subarterial VSD in ChinaL19 and Japan.K3,T5,T10

Prevalence is related in part to age at which the population is studied. AR is rarely present at birth but develops during the first decade of life (after age 2 years), then gradually worsens, such that by the end of the second decade it is usually severe.C12,D5 This rate of progression is similar whether the VSD is subarterial or perimembranous. At repair, the AR is mild to moderate in about half of patients and severe in about half.

As regurgitation increases, VSD shunt flow often decreases from occlusion of the VSD by the prolapsed aortic cusp. If the defect remains open through adolescence, about 10% of patients develop aortic valve prolapse or AR.O8

Secondary effects of AR on the LV are at least as marked as those of rheumatic AR and may be more severe because of additional volume load from the VSD. Rp is seldom if ever elevated, presumably because functionally the VSD is usually not large. Risk of infective endocarditis is high.R4

Aneurysms of the sinuses of Valsalva also may develop as part of the natural history of patients with doubly committed subarterial VSD or perimembranous VSD with outlet extension. This is a slower process than development of AR, and Momma and colleagues did not observe sinus of Valsalva aneurysms before age 10 years in patients with perimembranous VSDs.M13 Most often the aneurysm is observed during the third decade, when it may be present in 10% of patients whose VSDs of these types are still open.M13

#### TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

In patients in whom AR is trivial or absent, only the VSD is repaired. When AR is moderate or severe and often when it is mild, the aortic valve is repaired.M15 The aortic valve is usually replaced in adults, and this is done only when AR is moderate or severe.

TEE is performed after induction of anesthesia and before incision for a final analysis of the aortic valve and VSD. For myocardial protection, operation is performed on CPB with cold cardioplegia. A transverse aortotomy is made. Dimensions of the aortic root are measured at the ventriculoaortic junction ("anulus") and sinutubular junction. These dimensions are compared with normal valves adjusted for size of the patient (see "Dimensions of Normal Cardiac and Great Artery Pathways" in Chapter 1). The aortic valve is examined to assess feasibility of repair rather than replacement. If the cusp edge is retracted and thickened or the valve bicuspid, repair is usually not possible.

One or more leaflets may be repaired by the Trusler method of plicationT13 (Fig. 35-37). This procedure is carried out at the commissure adjacent to the prolapsed cusp (usually the right or noncoronary cusp). A 5-0 or 6-0 polypropylene suture is placed through the fibrous lacunae at the midpoint of each cusp. Cusps can then be assessed for elongation and attenuation. Cusp plication is performed at the elongated free edges of the aortic valve cusps. A 5-0 or 6-0 PTFE suture is woven between the right and noncoronary cusps to adjust the excessive length of the prolapsed cusp to the adjacent aortic wall. Repair may be reinforced by pledgets (pericardial or felt) or a small cap of polyester secured as a pledget over both affected cusps adjacent to the commissure. Hisatomi and colleagues proposed pledget stitch aortoplasty to make

**Figure 35-37** Repair of prolapsed aortic valve cusp by Trusler technique in patients with ventricular septal defect and aortic valve regurgitation. **A,** Transverse aortotomy is made at a level just downstream from commissural attachments of aortic valve. **B,** A stitch of 5-0 or 6-0 polypropylene is placed through midpoint of each cusp. Traction on this stitch allows identification of redundant or elongated free edges of a cusp, as shown here in the case of right coronary cusp near its commissure with noncoronary cusp. **C,** A 5-0 or 6-0 polytetrafluoroethylene suture is used to "reef up" redundant and attenuated portions of aortic valve. Double row of reefing stitches is used to bring ends of suture to outside of aorta at commissures. Pledget is added to strengthen repair.

the aortic cusps protrude for even greater aortic cusp coaptation.H7,H9 The stitch at the center of the valve is removed after VSD repair.

Approach to the VSD is appropriate to the location of the defect and may be transaortic if the defect is accessible. Any infundibular stenosis is relieved by excising trabecular muscle bands between the infundibular septum and free wall of the RV and, when necessary, by mobilizing and excising parietal and septal extensions of the infundibular septum and portions of the moderator bands.

An entirely different technique has been successfully used by Carpentier, Chauvaud, and colleagues.C3,C6 Its basic feature is triangular excision and reconstruction of the prolapsing cusp. Combined with this is an anuloplasty of the left ventriculoaortic junction. They also recommend that the VSD be repaired through the aortic root, using a glutaraldehydetreated pericardial patch.

Yacoub and colleagues have proposed another alternative repair (Fig. 35-38) that addresses the basic morphologic defect more completely.Y1 All anatomic components of the

**Figure 35-38** Repair of aortic valve in syndrome of ventricular septal defect *(VSD)* and aortic valve regurgitation by Yacoub technique. **A,** Aortic valve and VSD are approached through a transverse aortotomy. Morphologic defect causing lack of coaptation of aortic cusps is considered to be discontinuity between aortic media and "anulus" of aortic valve, resulting in lack of support to "anulus" and sinus of Valsalva, with downward and outward displacement of "anulus" into right ventricle. VSD is closed by plication suture, which elevates crest of septum to aortic media and plicates unsupported sinus of Valsalva. A series of interrupted mattress stitches using 4-0 braided polyester suture with pericardial pledgets are placed from crest of ventricular septum slightly toward its right ventricular aspect. Stitches are passed through "anulus" of aortic valve and reefed through unsupported sinus of Valsalva to strong tissue of aortic media. **B,** Stitches are tied down (knots inside aortic sinus), elevating ventricular crest to aortic valve "anulus" to close VSD as well as displacing "anulus" and aortic valve cusp centrally to achieve greater aortic cusp coaptation, restoring valve competence. (Modified from Yacoub and colleagues.Y1)

defect are corrected by a simple transaortic repair. A transverse aortotomy is made (Fig. 35-38, *A*). Extent of dilatation of the right coronary sinus and exact definition of the thin area of sinus resulting from discontinuity between aortic valve "anulus" and media of aorta are accurately defined. A series of pledget-reinforced mattress sutures are placed through the crest of the ventricular septum slightly on the RV side to avoid injuring the conduction system. Sutures are passed through the "anulus" of the aortic valve and then used to plicate the thin portion of the sinus of Valsalva and continued until strong aortic tissue supported by aortic media is reached. Tying of sutures results in closing the VSD, elevating the right coronary anulus and cusp, and reducing the size of the right coronary sinus and RV outflow tract bulge (Fig. 35-38, *B*). Repair of the defect is possible in all cases regardless of VSD size, which is usually slitlike, because there are always redundant tissues in the septum and aortic sinus in the vertical plane. Plication of redundant tissues toward the media of the

aortic sinus elevates the aortic valve cusp and anulus, displacing them centrally toward the aortic lumen. This results in increased aortic valve coaptation and restored aortic valve competence. This operation can be applied to patients with doubly committed subarterial VSDs with AR and thus may apply to the Asian population, in whom these types of defects are common.

If the valve requires replacement, the RV (or pulmonary trunk) should be opened before valve insertion, the VSD repaired, the RV closed, and then the aortic valve replaced. This sequence is advised because occasionally it may be necessary to place sutures from the prosthetic valve ring across the upper margin of the VSD patch where it extends between the base of the right and noncoronary cusps (in the region normally occupied by the membranous septum). Sutures in this area should be securely buttressed with pledgets. Although a freehand allograft has been used successfully for valve replacement under such circumstances,G10 degree of distortion of the aortic sinuses often makes accurate placement difficult.B3 Allograft aortic root replacement or aortic valve replacement with a pulmonary autograft (Ross procedure) is probably a better choice (see "Autograft Pulmonary Valve" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 12).

When there is also a true thin-walled aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva at the base of the right aortic cusp and a VSD, repair is more difficult because the sinus must also be repaired. If the aortic valve requires excision and replacement, excision should include the base of the cusp and the thinned area of the sinus wall, which becomes continuous with the VSD and is incorporated into its closure. Again, under such circumstances, the prosthetic valve suture line will cross the polyester patch. Aortic root replacement may be a simpler solution. When the valve is suitable for plication, the base of the cusp is preserved and sutured back to the patch.

#### RESULTS

#### Survival

Only 1 of 76 patients operated on by the UAB and GLH groups died in hospital (1.3%; CL 0.2%-4.4%); at last follow-up, no late deaths had occurred, an experience similar to that of Okita and colleagues over an 18-year follow-up and Yacoub and colleagues over 24 years with a mean follow-up of 8.4 years.O5,Y1 Thus, in the current era, risk of operation should approach 1%.

#### Heart Block

Heart block rarely occurs, even though operation is in the region of the conduction system. In Yacoub and colleagues' series of 38 patients, there were no cases of conduction abnormality, and ECG remained normal.Y1

#### Relief of Aortic Regurgitation

When AR is mild, VSD closure alone usually prevents progression of regurgitation. When AR is moderate before repair, about two thirds of patients have no or trivial AR after repair using the Trusler techniqueE3,H6,H8,O1,T13,T15 (Table 35-4). Satisfactory late outcomes have also been reported with techniques described by CarpentierC3 and Yacoub.Y1 Infrequently, AR is severe preoperatively, and chances of a good result decrease in this setting.

Okita and colleagues have determined perimembranous VSD (rather than VSDs in the RV outlet) to be a risk factor for important residual AR, possibly because factors other than cusp prolapse are partly responsible for preoperative AR when the VSD is perimembranous.O5 Bicuspid aortic valves are less satisfactorily repaired than tricuspid ones.

Older age at operation also contributes to presence of important AR after repair.

#### Freedom from Aortic Valve Replacement

Some patients will probably require aortic valve replacement in later life, although freedom from aortic valve reoperation using the Trusler technique was 89% at 8 years in the UAB group's series; parametrically predicted freedom at 20 years was 81%M2 (Fig. 35-39). Elgamal and colleagues confirmed these data, reporting 15-year freedom from reoperation of 81% ± 19% after Trusler repair of the aortic valve.E3 Adequacy of repair at operation was the most important determinant of long-term results. Yacoub and colleagues reported 5 valve replacements among 38 patients 8 to 11 years after operation.Y1

*a* Data from 36 patients operated on from 1967 to 1987. Three patients who had aortic valve replacement at the original operation after failure of Trusler repair and two other patients who had missing values for postoperative aortic regurgitation are not included.

These two patients received late postoperative aortic valve replacement.

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

When the murmur of AR first develops in a child with a VSD, the VSD should be promptly repaired while the AR is still mild.  $^{\text{C10,K22,T5,T6}}$  If cusp prolapse without AR is demonstrated by 2D echocardiography or on the aortogram in association with any perimembranous VSD, early repair is also indicated. Even if cusp prolapse has not occurred, doubly committed subarterial and moderate or large perimembranous VSDs with outlet extension should be closed before the patient is about 3 years of age to prevent cusp prolapse. R4 Patients having doubly committed subarterial VSD should have prompt operation regardless of age if any aortic valve deformity or regurgitation is detected; anatomic and hemodynamic features of the VSD contribute greatly to development of aortic valve cusp deformity and subsequent AR. K20,K21,O1,S12 When AR is moderate or severe and cusp prolapse is noted on the 2D echocardiogram or aortogram, operation should be undertaken promptly. Operation certainly should be done before the patient reaches age 10, because reconstruction of the valve is usually possible when operation is done during the first decade of life; thus, valve replacement is prevented or at least postponed. This fact is confirmed by the UAB experience, in which the average age of patients requiring replacement was 20 years, compared with 12 years for the remainder of the group.M2

When 2D echocardiography shows bicuspid aortic valve, or when the aortogram shows minimal enlargement of the sinuses and no cusp prolapse in the presence of severe AR, a bicuspid valve is probably present and valve replacement may be required. Operation should therefore be postponed until symptoms develop or LV enlargement indicates need for operation.

When operation is delayed until adult life, aortic valve replacement is usually required. O3

#### SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

Some surgeons prefer to visualize and repair VSDs through an aortotomy. C19,L6 This practice can produce good results, but if the VSD is perimembranous rather than in the RV

outflow tract, possibility of permanent damage to the bundle of His may be increased by this essentially LV approach to repair. Repair through the pulmonary trunk or RV is recommended for subarterial and anterior muscular defects, and through the right atrium or RV for perimembranous defects.

# Section III Straddling and Overriding Tricuspid (or Mitral) Valve

A straddling and overriding tricuspid valve sometimes coexists with an otherwise isolated VSD, usually one that extends posteriorly to the crux. Straddling and overriding of an AV valve may also coexist with a VSD that is simply part of a congenital cardiac anomaly (e.g., transposition of the great arteries, congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, univentricular AV connection). The subject is considered in its entirety in this chapter, with reference to other chapters.

Straddling and overriding of an AV valve always occur in relation to a VSD close to the valve. When straddling or overriding of an AV valve is mild, surgical considerations are usually related primarily to associated anomalies. When straddling or overriding is severe, or when there is associated hypoplasia of the ventricle to which the AV valve is appropriately (see following text) connected, surgical considerations are usually based primarily on straddling and overriding and severity of any coexisting ventricular hypoplasia.

Hypoplasia of the ventricle guarded by the straddling or overriding valve (termed the appropriate ventricle) usually coexists. Generally, the more severe the overriding, the greater the ventricular hypoplasia. Occasionally, a straddling or overriding AV valve has leaflets that differ from normal in number and morphology. Overriding and straddling AV valves may occasionally produce subpulmonary or subaortic obstruction.

#### **DEFINITION**

An AV valve is considered to be *straddling* when part of the tension apparatus of the valve crosses the VSD and the crest of the interventricular septum to attach to the septum or a papillary muscle in the opposite (inappropriate) ventricle. The tension apparatus is thus attached within both ventricles, and blood passing through the valve is directed into both ventricles. An AV valve is considered to be *overriding* when the AV junction to which the AV valve leaflets attach is connected to both ventricles. AV valve straddling and overriding usually occur in combination, and occasionally both AV valves are involved with these anomalies in the same heart.

#### **HISTORICAL NOTE**

Lambert in 1951 and Van Praagh and colleagues in 1964 appeared to be aware of AV valve straddling and overriding, although they were not explicit about it. <sup>12,V2</sup> In 1966, Mehrizi and colleagues referred to overriding and straddling of the right AV valve onto the RV in hearts with double inlet left

ventricle (DILV) and the LV lying posteriorly and to the left.M8 Subsequently, de la Cruz and Miller in 1968 and Lev and colleagues in 1969 referred to this occurrence in hearts with various types of "single ventricle" (generally double inlet ventricles).D3,L11

Rastelli and colleagues reported "straddling right atrioventricular valves" in hearts with a large VSD, but the right AV valve in their cases appears to have been both overriding and straddling.R3 These investigators identified malalignment of atrial and ventricular septa as the characteristic of hearts with overriding AV valves, along with cleft leaflets often present and juxtacrucial position of the VSD. Liberthson, one of whose coauthors was Lev, clearly distinguished between overriding and straddling AV valves in hearts with double inlet ventricles in 1971, although those terms were not used or defined.L12 Again, in the context of double inlet ventricles, Tandon and colleagues discussed "straddling AV valves."T2 Thereafter, ease of diagnosis provided by 2D echocardiography rapidly led to broader recognition and improved understanding of these AV valve abnormalities.L1,S8

Surgical management of straddling and overriding AV valves was first reported in 1979, independently by Pacifico and by Tabry and their colleagues.D1,P1,T1 Surgical possibilities, rapidly expanding knowledge of morphology of congenital heart disease, and increased use of 2D echocardiography resulted in clear perception of the morphology and implications of these AV valve anomalies.

Clarifying terminology used in this section was evolved by Milo and Ho and their colleagues in studies of straddling and overriding AV valves.H17,M10 Milo and colleagues described disposition of the conduction system in hearts with overriding AV valves,M10 and Anderson and colleagues formulated the basis for categorizing these hearts as well as those with univentricular AV connections ("single ventricle").A11

#### MORPHOLOGY

#### Morphologic Syndromes

When atria are in usual (solitus) situs, ventricular topology is right-handed, and AV and ventriculoarterial (VA) connections are concordant (see "Terminology and Classification of Heart Disease" in Chapter 1), the right AV valve sometimes overrides or straddles. This anomaly is associated with a posteriorly placed (juxtacrucial) VSD in the inlet portion of the ventricular septum when viewed from the RV aspect. The interventricular septum does not attach to the crux cordis in this situation. The overriding tricuspid valve is associated with malalignment of the atrial and interventricular septa. The RV is usually somewhat hypoplastic.

When there is atrial situs solitus, ventricular righthandedness (D-loop), AV concordant connection, and discordant VA connection (complete transposition of the great arteries), the left AV valve may be overriding, in this case over a VSD in the anterior portion of the ventricular septum.

When there is atrial situs solitus, ventricular righthandedness, AV concordant connection, and DORV (one of the most common situations in which overriding and straddling of an AV valve occurR5), the right AV valve may be overriding and is usually straddling in hearts with a VSD that is juxta-aortic, and usually also perimembranous and juxtacrucial. When the VSD is juxtapulmonary and somewhat anterior (Taussig-Bing heart), the left AV valve may be straddling and overriding a VSD that does not extend to the crux cordis.K19

When there is atrial situs solitus, left-handed ventricular topology (L-loop), AV discordant connection, and VA discordant connection (congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries), the right AV valve (which generally in this setting has two leaflets) may override an anteriorly situated VSD. The interventricular septum does reach the crux cordis. When overriding of the right AV valve in this setting is more than 50%, there is double inlet right ventricle (DIRV) with the RV lying to the left and more or less posterior, and an anterior, right-sided, and often hypoplastic and rudimentary (incomplete) LV.

In hearts with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, the left-sided AV valve may override a posteriorly placed VSD; in these hearts, the interventricular septum does not reach the crux cordis. When overriding is more than 50%, the condition is DILV with left-sided and anteriorly placed hypoplastic and rudimentary (incomplete) RV, the most common type of double inlet ventricle. A special group of cases with AV discordant connection, usually with DORV, involves a VSD that is juxtacrucial and in which one or both AV valves are overriding and straddling. Ventricles in this setting are usually in an over-and-under position, and circulations appear to crisscross within the heart.

Similar patterns may occur with atrial situs inversus and with atrial situs ambiguous.

#### Conduction System

Knowledge of location of the AV node and bundle of His is required for satisfactory surgical treatment of cardiac malformations. When the AV valve is overriding or straddling a VSD that does not reach the crux cordis, the conduction system is usually unaffected by the overriding valve.A12 Thus, the AV node is in its usual location in the AV septum when the ventricular topology is right-handed and the AV connection concordant. When the ventricular topology is left-handed and the AV connection discordant, the conduction system generally arises from an anomalous anterolateral node, and this is unaffected by the overriding valve.

When in hearts with AV concordant connection the AV valve (in this case the tricuspid valve) overrides a VSD that is juxtacrucial (such defects may be perimembranous as well), the AV node is situated anomalously.A12 It lies at the point inferiorly at which the ventricular septum attaches to the anulus (or circumference) of the right AV valve.M10

When the VSD is juxtacrucial and the AV connection discordant, the left AV valve overrides and the AV node occupies an anterolateral position near the right AV valve anulus, as is usual in hearts with AV discordant connection.

#### CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

Straddling and overriding of an AV valve are uncommon, occurring as an added anomaly in about 3% of patients with congenital heart disease. They seem to be more prevalent in hearts with AV discordant connection than in those with AV concordant connections (Table 35-5). Among hearts with AV concordant connections, straddling and overriding of an AV valve occur most often in hearts with DORV and in those with complete transposition of the great arteries.

Coexisting cardiac anomalies, not straddling and overriding of the AV valve, generally determine the clinical syndrome, natural history, and diagnostic features in patients with straddling or overriding of the AV valves.

Straddling and overriding AV valves are usually competent and have no features that permit their identification by history, physical examination, chest radiograph, or ECG. Echocardiography is the technique by which they are generally diagnosed, although overriding can often be diagnosed or inferred from the angiogram.B15,S17

#### TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

When an AV valve is only overriding, repair of the associated VSD or other cardiac anomalies can usually be done in essentially the normal manner, except for some deviation of the patch to accommodate the overriding. Straddling presents a more severe surgical challenge, particularly when it is moderate or severe in degree and when the inappropriate ventricle into which the straddling cords enter is not the one the surgeon is working in which.M7 For these reasons, the Fontan operation (see Section IV of Chapter 41) is often the most appropriate option when severe straddling or overriding is present.

#### Section of Straddling Cords

Rarely, a single straddling cord can be sectioned to permit repair of a VSD or an intraventricular tunnel repair, without rendering the AV valve regurgitant. This technique can probably be used only when straddling is mild.

#### Slotting of Repair Patch

Rarely, straddling cords can fit into a slot or cut made in the patch used to close the VSD or make an intraventricular tunnel. The slot is then closed by sutures. This technique is applicable only to mild or possibly moderate straddling involving just a few cords, and it probably results in loss of free motion of the cords.

#### Reattachment of Sectioned Tensor Apparatus

When straddling is mild or moderate, and when the straddling tensor apparatus attaches to only one papillary muscle or area of the muscular interventricular septum in the inappropriate ventricle, and when that muscle has no other cord attachments, the muscle may be sectioned at its base. Then, along with its straddling cords, the muscle is brought back into the appropriate ventricle. The VSD is closed with a patch, or if indicated, an intraventricular tunnel repair is performed. Finally, the muscle to which the straddling cords connect is reattached to the patch or tunnel.

This technique is used infrequently and is applicable only when surgery is being performed from within the appropriate ventricle, approached either through its atrium or a ventriculotomy. Probability of dehiscence of a reattached papillary muscle or tendinous cord has not been determined.

#### Minor Septation

The patch used to close a VSD or create an intraventricular tunnel may be deviated around the papillary muscle and septal attachments of a straddling AV valve so that they lie within the appropriate ventricle after repair (Figs. 35-40 and 35-41). This approach is most easily performed when straddling is *into* the ventricle the surgeon is working in, through its atrium or a ventriculotomy. This is usually the ventricle ejecting into the pulmonary trunk: the right-sided RV in DORV with concordant AV connection, or the right-sided LV in hearts with discordant AV connection. In some cases, however, the technique of minor septation can be applied when straddling is into the ventricle ejecting into the aorta (see Fig. 35-40).

#### Replacement of Straddling Atrioventricular Valve

When the straddling AV valve is regurgitant (a relatively unusual situation), operation usually includes valve replacement. In some cases, this approach may be used simply because of complexity and severity of the straddling. The valve replacement device may face onto the patch used for repair of the VSD or creation of an intraventricular tunnel, because of the malalignment of the atrial and ventricular septa. This possibility emphasizes the value of a low-profile device in this setting, and even with such a device, some functional impairment may result.

Several cords from mitral valve straddled to insert on right ventricular side of septum near ventricular septal defect.

One patient also had right atrioventricular valve atresia.

**Figure 35-40** Minor septation for repair of a perimembranous, juxta-aortic, and juxtacrucial ventricular septal defect (VSD) associated with overriding and straddling of tricuspid valve in a patient with atrial situs solitus, ventricular D-loop, and atrioventricular and ventriculoatrial concordant connection. **A,** Approach is through usual oblique right atriotomy. Cords of septal leaflet straddle across VSD to attach anomalously to several papillary muscles within left ventricle; tricuspid valve also overrides 10% to 20% onto left ventricle. **B,** Repair is made through tricuspid valve. As shown, patch used for repair is placed on left side of septum and of papillary muscles to which tricuspid septal leaflet cords attach. **C,** Completed repair. (From Pacifico and colleagues.P1)

Particular care and thoughtfulness are required when straddling or overriding occurs in the setting of ventricular L-loop, when valve replacement appears to be indicated. This situation, along with the sometimes associated complete heart block, may compromise long-term outlook sufficiently that a Fontan operation is preferable to a two-ventricle repair (see Chapter 41).

#### Fontan Operation

The Fontan operation is also the only method that can be used when moderate or severe hypoplasia of a ventricle is associated with straddling and overriding AV valves. Current information concerning early and intermediate-term results of this operation encourages its wider use when AV

Straddling and overriding left AV (tricuspid) valve is shown, as well as ventricular septal defect and aortic overriding. **B,** Repair patch creates an intraventricular tunnel conducting systemic arterial blood flow from left-sided right ventricle to aorta and keeping entire left AV valve apparatus on appropriate side of patch. (From Pacifico and colleagues.P1)

valve straddling or overriding is moderate or severe (see Chapter 41).

#### Cardiac Transplantation

Cardiac transplantation is reserved for patients with straddling and overriding AV valves in whom a severe secondary cardiomyopathy has developed (see Section II in Chapter 21).

#### RESULTS

Early and intermediate-term (5 to 15 years) survival after surgery in patients with straddling and overriding AV valves is determined primarily by the cardiac defect with which the AV valve anomaly is associated. However, survival is somewhat less satisfactory than that in general after repair of the primary cardiac defect. Exceptions are patients in whom the Fontan operation or cardiac transplantation is performed; survival after these operations is unrelated to the cardiac anomaly for which the operation was done and is not lessened by presence of a straddling or overriding AV valve.

Heart block has occurred more frequently than usual after repair of hearts with concordant AV connection and overriding AV valves associated with a VSD extending to the crux cordis and in patients with discordant AV connection. Because position of the AV node and conduction system in such hearts is now known, heart block should now occur less frequently.

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

*Indications* for operation in patients with overriding and straddling AV valves lie with the coexisting anomalies rather than with the AV valve anomaly.

*Strategy* of operation is greatly influenced by the AV valve anomaly, and whenever possible that strategy should be decided in early life. If straddling is mild, the strategy can probably be that for the coexisting anomaly in general, and the AV valve anomaly can be managed by the technique of minor septation or an even lesser procedure.

When straddling is severe, these techniques seem likely to be associated with a relatively high early risk. Valve replacement in this setting carries more than the usual early and intermediate risks and imponderables. A Fontan operation probably is associated with better early and late results than these procedures and is the only type of procedure that can be considered when the patient has important ventricular hypoplasia. Therefore, diagnosis of AV valve straddling or overriding should be made in early infancy. If the patient has cyanosis from reduced pulmonary blood flow, a PTFE interposition systemic–pulmonary arterial shunt or a bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis should be performed (see Chapters 38 and 41). If there is a large left-to-right shunt, pulmonary trunk banding should be performed in early life. In either case, the Fontan operation is then performed in patients aged 1 to 2 years, before ventricular hypertrophy becomes marked (see Chapter 41).
