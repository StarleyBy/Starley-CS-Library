# DEFINITION

Acquired diseases of both the aortic and mitral valves severe enough to require simultaneous surgery (replacement, repair, or valvotomy) are considered in this chapter. Because tricuspid valve disease may form part of this spectrum and require simultaneous surgery, it is also considered, although discussed in more detail in Chapter 14.

# HISTORICAL NOTE

Surgical treatment of combined aortic and mitral valve disease began during the early 1950s by closed methods. In 1955, Likoff and colleagues reported 74 patients who had undergone simultaneous closed repair of aortic and mitral stenosis by Bailey and Glover in Philadelphia.L1 In 1958, Lillehei and colleagues were the first to report simultaneous repairs of both valves by open techniques using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).L2 In 1963, soon after introduction of durable mechanical prostheses, Cartwright and colleagues first reported simultaneous aortic and mitral valve replacement.C1 In 1964, Starr and colleagues reported 13 patients who had undergone multiple valve replacements, including one who received mechanical aortic, mitral, and tricuspid prostheses.S2

### MORPHOLOGY

Morphology of diseases involving mitral, aortic, and tricuspid valves is described in Chapters 11, 12, and 14. In most patients, multivalvar disease is rheumatic in origin, but each valve may manifest a separate pathologic condition—for example, rheumatic aortic valve disease and mitral regurgitation from infective endocarditis, idiopathic chordal rupture, or ischemic papillary muscle dysfunction.

The effect of combined disease on morphology of the left ventricle (LV) is of great importance. Thus, at the extremes, combined aortic and mitral regurgitation imposes a large volume overload on the LV, and LV volume and wall thickness increase severely; combined aortic and mitral stenosis results in a small, thick-walled, noncompliant LV.

# CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

In general, clinical criteria and noninvasive diagnostic tests are the same for mitral and aortic valve disease whether they are combined or isolated, but additional cardiac catheterization and angiography data are more frequently needed when they are combined. In patients older than 40 years of age, coronary angiography is indicated routinely, and the valve lesions are assessed at that time.

One lesion is usually dominant and may modify the clinical signs of the less dominant one. A frequent problem is assessing severity of the less dominant lesion; if it is mild or even mild to moderate, it may not require simultaneous correction. Historically, it was sometimes possible to obtain reliable information on the second lesion during operation by palpating an atrial chamber to detect systolic pulsation, by feeling the valve directly with the finger before beginning CPB, or by exposing the valve. Today, with two-dimensional (2D) and color Doppler echocardiography, the status of the aortic, mitral, and tricuspid valves is usually known before the patient enters the operating room. Intraoperative use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) verifies this status if necessary.

#### Dominant Aortic Stenosis

Dominant aortic stenosis is diagnosed by the same techniques used in isolated aortic stenosis (see Chapter 12). Dominant aortic stenosis may complicate diagnosing coexisting mitral stenosis by simple methods. The auscultatory signs of moderate mitral stenosis may be masked, and transmission of the aortic systolic murmur to the apex may confuse the assessment of mitral regurgitation. However, Doppler echocardiography can render as precise a diagnosis as in isolated mitral stenosis. Severity of pure mitral stenosis associated with aortic stenosis can be verified by pressure measurements (left atrium to LV) on the operating table, although varying cardiac output sometimes makes interpretation difficult. In questionable cases, the valve may be palpated on CPB or examined directly by opening the left atrium through the superior approach (see Chapter 11).

A convincing sign of important mitral regurgitation associated with aortic stenosis is a right parasternal systolic lift, especially if associated with an apical third heart sound when the venous and hepatic pulses do not indicate important tricuspid regurgitation. More than modest left atrial enlargement on the posteroanterior chest radiograph and also P mitrale in the electrocardiogram strongly suggest important associated mitral valve disease. Two-dimensional echocardiography with Doppler color flow interrogation is helpful in identifying mitral regurgitation, both preoperatively and intraoperatively.

#### Dominant Aortic Regurgitation

In dominant aortic regurgitation, as noted in Chapter 12, an Austin Flint murmur can mimic that of mitral stenosis, the absence of which can be confirmed by 2D echocardiography with Doppler color flow interrogation. If in addition to a mid-diastolic murmur there is an opening snap, left atrial enlargement above grade 2, and P mitrale, then important coexisting mitral stenosis is usually present.

With dominant aortic stenosis, severity of associated mitral regurgitation requires careful assessment by 2D echocardiography, particularly because it is frequently secondary to LV enlargement or dysfunction. If it is less than grade 2 in severity, it usually regresses after the aortic regurgitation is corrected. When the LV is severely enlarged, it is likely that both aortic and mitral regurgitation are severe.

#### Dominant Mitral Stenosis

Dominant mitral stenosis may minimize the usual signs and symptoms of coexisting aortic regurgitation. When aortic regurgitant flow is moderate or large, its presence and severity are readily assessed clinically by character of the arterial pulse and blood pressure. At times, however, what seems to be less than grade 2 aortic regurgitation becomes clearly moderate or severe after surgical relief of the mitral stenosis. Magnitude of aortic regurgitation cannot be assessed reliably at operation. Visual inspection of the aortic valve may provide information about extent of the rheumatic condition but not about magnitude of the leakage. Thus, evaluating the aortic valve preoperatively with 2D echocardiography Doppler color flow interrogation is important before undertaking mitral valve surgery. Intraoperative TEE can be of value as well. Size of the jet visualized by color Doppler echocardiography may not represent the degree of aortic regurgitation. It is possible to measure the *vena contracta,* which is the size of the regurgitant jet within the regurgitant aortic valve orifice. This measurement correlates well with effective regurgitant orifice. Width of the vena contracta is measured from the parasternal view long axis, just below the flow convergence. *Vena contracta greater than or equal to 7 mm uniformly indicates severe aortic valve regurgitation, whereas measurements of 5 mm or less correspond to regurgitation that is moderate or less.*

Moderate (grade 2) associated aortic stenosis can usually be identified clinically by characteristic physical findings (see Chapter 12), and LV-aortic gradient can be measured at operation, but flow may not be known. Therefore, an estimate of aortic valve orifice size by 2D echocardiography or cardiac catheterization (see Chapter 12) should be available when mitral valve surgery is undertaken.

#### Dominant Mitral Regurgitation

The same considerations discussed for dominant mitral stenosis apply to aortic valve disease associated with dominant mitral regurgitation.

#### Dominant Tricuspid Valve Disease

In uncommon cases of dominant tricuspid stenosis or regurgitation, accurate clinical assessment of downstream lesions in the mitral and aortic valves is seldom possible. Preoperative 2D echocardiographic study is required, and occasionally cardiac catheterization as well.

# NATURAL HISTORY

The natural history of combined aortic and mitral valve disease is complicated by the same variability in dominance of one lesion over the other that makes diagnosis and decision making difficult. For example, in rheumatic aortic valve disease, the mitral valve is involved almost universally, although the lesions—either stenosis or regurgitation—may be so mild that operation is not required until many years after replacement of the aortic valve. Double valve surgery in such patients is sequential. Patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease often have only mild rheumatic aortic valve disease at the time of their original mitral operation. The longer these patients survive, the more likely it is that a mild rheumatic aortic lesion will become important and require operation. Choudhary and colleagues followed 284 patients with rheumatic heart disease who had mild aortic valve involvement at the time of mitral valve surgery.C3 After a mean interval of about 5 years, 35% of those with mild aortic valve stenosis had progressed to moderate or severe stenosis. Freedom from development of moderate or severe aortic valve stenosis was 75% ± 6%, 62% ± 9%, and 46% ± 11% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Mild aortic valve regurgitation at the time of mitral valve intervention, on the other hand, progressed slowly, with only 5% of patients developing moderate or severe aortic valve regurgitation after a mean interval of 12 years. Freedom from development of moderate or severe aortic valve regurgitation was 100%, 97% ± 2%, and 87% ± 5% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively.

Simultaneous development of important aortic and mitral valve disease usually results from a particularly severe and prolonged attack of rheumatic fever or from recurrent attacks, and there may be a florid myocarditis and pericarditis as well. Regurgitant combined valve lesions may mature particularly rapidly, requiring operation by the second decade of life.

When dominant aortic stenosis coexists with mitral stenosis, prognosis may be worse than that of isolated aortic stenosis. When dominant mitral stenosis coexists with important aortic stenosis, survival is shorter than for isolated mitral stenosis, with sudden death being a particular risk. When severe aortic and mitral regurgitation coexist, reduction of LV afterload by mitral regurgitation provides a protective effect (see Chapter 11), and patients with aortic regurgitation tend to remain asymptomatic despite advanced left ventricular dysfunction (see Chapter 12). Consequently, it is likely that patients with this combination will remain asymptomatic well beyond the stage when left ventricular dysfunction becomes irreversible.

# TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

After induction of general inhalation anesthesia and during appropriate preparation of the skin and draping of a sterile field, an echocardiography probe is inserted into the esophagus (see Chapter 4). Two-dimensional ultrasound imaging is used to evaluate valve morphology and color Doppler ultrasound to evaluate valvar hemodynamics. The plan for operation is then refined. The aortic valve is replaced in most circumstances, but it may be repaired if there is aortic valve regurgitation that is judged to be secondary to dilatation of the aortic root or to dilatation or aneurysm of the ascending aorta. The mitral valve may be repaired or replaced. The tricuspid valve may not need intervention or may be repaired. The crux of the operation usually involves the intervention judged necessary for the mitral valve; there are more options available for it than for the aortic valve, and the tricuspid valve is usually reparable.

A median sternotomy is performed. The cardiac valves lie in close proximity to each other, so an extensive incision is unnecessary. The pericardium is opened and suspended to provide optimal exposure of the heart. A systematic evaluation is made by assessing cardiac chamber size and palpating for thrills caused by turbulent blood flow. CPB is established using a single venous uptake cannula or two venous cannulae if the left atrium is small. Two venous cannulae and caval tapes with tourniquets are required for operations involving the tricuspid valve (see Chapter 2). Oxygenated blood is returned through a cannula placed in the ascending aorta. Multiple valve operations are enhanced by using small cannulae and vacuum-assisted venous return (see "Vacuum-Assisted Venous Return" in Chapter 2). The perfusate may be cooled to lower the body temperature to 28°C.

Operations involving more than one cardiac valve are most conveniently performed using intermittent retrograde administration of cardioplegic solution via the coronary sinus (see "Technique of Retrograde Infusion" in Chapter 3). A perfusion cannula is inserted into the coronary sinus through the right atrial wall for aortic and mitral valve operations, or directly after opening the right atrium for operations involving the tricuspid valve.

A vascular clamp occludes the ascending aorta. A vent catheter is inserted through the right superior pulmonary vein and advanced across the mitral valve into the LV. A transverse aortotomy is made and cold cardioplegia administered. For tricuspid valve operations, the right atrium is opened parallel to the atrioventricular groove, the coronary sinus cannula is inserted, and cold cardioplegia is administered.

The aortotomy is extended into the noncoronary sinus of Valsalva or extended to divide the aorta above the sinutubular junction. The aortic valve is inspected for the possibility of repair. If it is not reparable, it is excised. Calcareous deposits are removed from the aortic anulus. Diameter of the LV outflow tract at the aortoventricular junction (aortic anulus) is measured.

The operation then focuses on the mitral valve. The left atrium is opened on the right side posterior to the interatrial groove at the junction of the right pulmonary vein, and the incision is extended superiorly behind the superior vena cava and inferiorly behind the inferior vena cava. Alternatively, the superior aspect of the left atrium is opened medial to the superior vena cava and behind the aortic anulus. This superior approach is particularly useful when the aorta has been divided. When operation on the tricuspid valve is required, a transseptal approach may be convenient, extending the right atrial incision superiorly medial to the superior vena cava and onto the superior aspect of the left atrium. The atrial septum is cut back inferiorly through the fossa ovalis to the inferior wall of the left atrium. A self-retaining retractor maintains exposure of the mitral valve.

The mitral valve is inspected for the possibility of repair. If repair is not feasible, the valve is usually replaced with a mechanical prosthesis, although second- or third-generation stent-mounted bioprostheses may be used in patients older than (≈)70 years of age. This influences the choice of replacement device for the aortic valve, because it is usually replaced with the same type of valve as the mitral valve (see "Choice of Device" in Chapter 12). The only exception to mixing rather than matching the type of prosthesis is in the case of a very small aortic root, when a stentless bioprosthesis (allograft or xenograft) may be chosen (see "Small Aortic Root and Small Prosthesis: Prosthesis-Patient Mismatch" in Chapter 12). If the mitral valve is reparable, more selection options are available for the aortic valve, with weight given to a bioprosthesis to avoid anticoagulation if the cardiac rhythm is likely to be normal sinus after operation. The tricuspid valve is usually repaired regardless of choices made for the aortic and mitral positions. Occasionally the tricuspid valve is involved by rheumatic disease and requires replacement.

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) may be required in combination with multiple valve procedures. It is usually performed after the valves are excised but before the prostheses are inserted, to reduce risk of atrioventricular groove disruption during cardiac retraction to expose the posterior wall of the LV. Proximal vein graft anastomoses to the aorta for left-sided grafts may be performed after completing distal anastomoses to the coronary arteries. For right-sided grafts, the proximal anastomosis is deferred until the atria and aorta are closed.

# SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Postoperative care of patients who have undergone combined aortic and mitral valve surgery is the same as that for other patients undergoing cardiac surgery with the aid of CPB (see Chapter 5). Anticoagulants are indicated in patients with atrial fibrillation or mechanical prostheses.

# RESULTS

# Survival

# *Early (Hospital) Death*

Simultaneous aortic and mitral valve replacement is often accompanied by other procedures, so complexity of the operation partly explains higher hospital mortality after multiple valve operations than after single valve surgery. In the Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Adult Cardiac Surgery Database, operative mortality during the 1990s ranged from 6.9% to 9.9%.S3 Hannan and colleagues reported hospital mortality of 9.6% in 1418 multiple valvuloplasty or replacement operations from 1995 to 1997 in the state of New York.H1 John and colleagues reported 9.2% hospital mortality among 456 patients having aortic and mitral valve replacements,J1 whereas Mueller and colleagues reported 5%.M4 When CABG was added to the multiple valve operation, operative mortality doubled to 19% in the state of New York experience.H1

# *Time-Related Survival*

Time-related survival of heterogeneous groups of patients undergoing simultaneous combined aortic and mitral valve replacement, including those undergoing concomitant tricuspid valve surgery and CABG, is lower than after single valve replacement.A2,A3,G2,M5,T1 In the UAB group's experience from an earlier era, it was 88%, 77%, 63%, 47%, and 23% at 1 month and 1, 5, 10, and 20 years after operation, respectively. The hazard function for death has a rapidly declining early phase of risk, giving way to a second slowly increasing hazard phase about 3 months postoperatively. The increasing phase of hazard may reflect an imperfect postoperative hemodynamic state dating from the time of operation.

# Modes of Death

Most deaths early after primary combined aortic and mitral valve replacement are from acute or subacute cardiac failure. However, an unusually high prevalence of death with hemorrhage has occurred in this group of patients in the past. This is because of the ease with which left atrioventricular rupture can be produced at the time of double valve replacement. Currently, greater attention to this detail has considerably lessened the prevalence of this early postoperative complication.

Mode of death occurring after hospitalization discharge is most commonly due to chronic heart failure. Even when tricuspid valve regurgitation and right ventricular dysfunction have seemed to be absent before operation, a number of patients present late postoperatively with increasing evidence of tricuspid regurgitation, right atrial enlargement, and progressing hepatomegaly. The reason for the unusually high prevalence is not apparent. However, the primary feature appears to be right ventricular dysfunction, and tricuspid valve replacement at this stage generally does not improve the patient's condition.

#### Incremental Risk Factors for Death

# *Double Valve Replacement*

Double valve replacement itself is an incremental risk factor for death (9.4%) compared with isolated replacement of the mitral (5.7%) or aortic valve (3.5%).S3 This is evident early after operation, and particularly in intermediate and long-term follow-up, when many deaths occur because of increasing tricuspid regurgitation progressing to right atrial enlargement, hepatomegaly, and finally cardiac cachexia. These types of death occur much less frequently after isolated mitral valve replacement and rarely after isolated aortic valve replacement.M1 The relative roles of decreasing LV performance, increasing pulmonary vascular resistance, and decreasing right ventricular performance in this late deterioration after double valve replacement are uncertain.

# *Mitral Valve Replacement Rather than Repair*

One-stage mitral and aortic valve operations may not involve replacement of both valves. When they do not, the early risks have generally been less, even when concomitant tricuspid valve surgery is performed, and the intermediate and longterm results are better.A2,G3,T1,T2 Gillinov and colleagues reported hospital mortality of 5.4% when the mitral valve was repaired and 7.0% when it was replaced.G3 They also reported 15-year survival of 46% when the mitral valve was repaired compared with 34% when it was replaced (*P* = .01; Fig. 13-1). The instantaneous risk of death was highest immediately postoperatively, decreased to its lowest level at 1 year, and increased slowly thereafter (Fig. 13-2). The late phase of hazard was consistently higher after mitral valve replacement than after repair.

#### *Previous Operations*

Approximately 15% of patients undergoing first-time simultaneous replacement of the aortic and mitral valves have had a previous valve operation. This has not, however, increased the risks of the double valve replacement.

#### *Choice of Replacement Device*

Choice of replacement device does not affect long-term survival. Caus and colleagues compared a matched population aged 60 ± 3 years having aortic and mitral valve replacement with either mechanical prostheses or bioprostheses.C2 Survival at 5, 10, and 15 years was similar, although reoperation was

more common in the bioprostheses group, and thromboembolic complications were more common in the mechanical valve group.

# *Age at Operation*

Historically, age at operation has not been identified as an incremental risk factor for death during the first 30 days after operation (Table 13-1). However, more patients are now being operated on in their eighth and ninth decades of life, so older age is probably a risk factor for early postoperative death in the current era. It clearly is a risk factor for death late postoperatively, especially for patients older than 70 years at the time of operation (Fig. 13-3).G3,H1,M4 Gillinov and colleagues demonstrated a 20% survival advantage for patients having operation at age 50 versus those having operation at age 65.

# *Left Ventricular Function and Preoperative Functional Status*

The more advanced the heart failure, and thus the functional disability, the greater the early and late risks of death (Fig. 13-4). Patients whose condition necessitates an emergency operation can be expected to be particularly at risk early postoperatively.M4 Even patients in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II have reduced late survival.

LV ejection fraction below 30% increased hospital mortality in multiple valve replacement in the New York State study to 13%, compared with 9.3% when it was higher.H1 Mueller and colleagues found that LV ejection fraction below 50% increased risk of all deaths (*P* < .001).M4 Moderate or severe LV dysfunction is a risk factor for death in the early and late hazard phases.G3,T2

# *Left Ventricular Enlargement*

Greater LV enlargement is a powerful risk factor for death late postoperatively. Because of the large volume overload, combined severe aortic and mitral regurgitation has a strong tendency to produce marked LV enlargement; the outcome after operation for patients with severe LV enlargement and this combination of valve lesions is particularly poor, with 5-, 10-, and 20-year survival of 64%, 37%, and 9%, respectively (Fig. 13-5).

The plot is a nomogram of a specific solution of the multivariable equation. (See Appendix 13A for details.)

#### Valve Pathology

Imperfect outcome after double valve replacement is well illustrated by survival of patients with the most favorable valve pathology—namely, important stenosis at one or both valves with only grade 2 LV enlargement (see Fig. 13-5). The combination of severe mitral regurgitation and severe aortic regurgitation has mildly increased the risk of death early after operation (see Fig. 13-5). Mueller and colleagues also found that aortic valve stenosis is a risk factor in the early hazard phase. M3

Patients having multiple valve operations for rheumatic valvar heart disease have greater survival benefit than those having operations for nonrheumatic disease. John and colleagues reported survival of 85% at 15 years and 82% at 24 years in patients with a mean age of 33 years having aortic and mitral valve replacement for rheumatic valve disease.<sup>11</sup> Mueller and colleagues reported survival of 56% at 15 years and a linearized death rate of 2.3% per patient-year in a group of older patients (mean age 56 years) in whom 55% underwent operation for rheumatic disease. M4 Gillinov and colleagues also reported that patients with rheumatic disease had greater predicted survival benefit than patients with nonrheumatic disease and that repair of the mitral valve further improved survival<sup>G3</sup> (Fig. 13-6). Nonrheumatic disease reduced survival in even the lowest-risk patients, and age at operation further reduced the chance of surviving for 16 years after aortic valve replacement and mitral valve repair or replacement (see Fig. 13-3, *B*).

# Cardiac Comorbidity

Early mortality is increased by the presence of important tricuspid regurgitation, necessitating associated annuloplasty or, particularly, valve replacement, although this is not evident in all analyses. G1,G2,M5,T1 It is also increased by presence of ischemic heart disease requiring concomitant CABG, especially left main coronary artery stenosis. G3,M4 Pulmonary vascular resistance that is elevated before operation affects late survival. Mueller and colleagues also found that pulmonary systolic pressure of 60 mmHg or more is a risk factor for early death. Atrial fibrillation is a risk factor for death in the late

hazard phase, presumably because of the added risk of embolism and late heart failure related to the atrial dysrhythmia. G3 Tricuspid valve operations in combination with aortic and mitral valve procedures reduce early and late survival. M2,T2

# Noncardiac Comorbidity

Renal disease increases risk of death in the late hazard phase, and elevated blood urea nitrogen adds risk in the early phase after operation. Gast Dialysis at the time of operation increases early relative risk ninefold. Diabetes mellitus also increases risk. H1,M4 Hepatic failure increased early risk of operation from 9.2% to 26% in the New York State series. H1

#### **Functional Status**

Most surviving patients are considerably improved by double valve replacement. A2 However, by 10 years after operation, only 51% are in NYHA functional class I, and 34% are in class II (Fig. 13-7). The proportion of surviving patients who are in NYHA functional class I gradually declines as follow-up becomes longer, reaching only 35% by 20 years. Because only 47% of patients undergoing aortic and mitral valve replacement with or without concomitant procedures are alive 10

Squares represent class I, circles class II, triangles class III, and diamonds class IV. (See Appendix 13B for details.) (Data from UAB group, 1970-1981.)

years after operation (see Fig. 13-1), only one fourth of patients operated on are alive and in NYHA functional class I 10 years after operation; at 20 years after operation, the percentage is only 8%. John and colleagues reported 72% in functional class I, 25% in class II, and 3.1% in class III at median 8.5 years of follow-up after aortic and mitral valve replacement for rheumatic disease. As noted earlier, this patient group was also young (mean age 33 years).

#### Freedom from Thromboembolism

Freedom from thromboembolism after primary combined aortic and mitral valve replacement (Fig. 13-8) is similar to that after isolated mitral valve replacement. The use of bioprostheses in both positions has not eliminated late postoperative thromboembolic episodes. Mueller and colleagues found similar results in a group of patients in which 82% had double valve replacement with bileaflet mechanical valves. Freedom from thromboembolism was 89% at 5 years, 74% at 10 years, and 66% at 15 years. Mitral valve repair did not reduce the risk compared with double valve replacement.

Just as after isolated mitral valve replacement or mitral commissurotomy, risk of a subsequent thromboembolic event is increased by more postoperative thromboembolic events (see Fig. 13-8) as well as those occurring prior to operation.

# Complications of Anticoagulant Therapy

Prevalence of hemorrhage related to anticoagulant therapy is no different after double valve replacement than after single valve replacement (see "Complications of Long-Term Anticoagulation" under Mitral Valve Replacement in Section I of Chapter 11). In patients in whom mechanical prostheses were used (bileaflet in 82%), freedom from bleeding events was

89% at 5 years, 81% at 10 years, and 73% at 15 years. Linearized rates of valve-related thromboembolism and bleeding with bileaflet prostheses are listed in Table 13-2.

# Hemolysis and Valve Thrombosis

With two mechanical prostheses, hemolysis and valve thrombosis are greater than with one. Both complications are rare.

# Reoperation

As has been the experience with reoperations after valve replacement in general, the risk of yet another reoperation becomes greater after each (Fig. 13-9).

![](_page_7_Figure_7.jpeg)

**Figure 13-8** Freedom from thromboembolism after primary simultaneous aortic and mitral valve replacement, with or without other procedures, according to number of previous postoperative thromboembolic events. Graph was constructed by reentering patients at a new time zero at the time of each thromboembolic event (see "Repeated Events" in Chapter 6). (Data from UAB group, 1967-1981; *n* = 569.)

Need to reoperate is usually determined by the durability of the repair or replacement device applied in the mitral position (Fig. 13-10). Reoperation is done least frequently when mechanical prostheses are used. More than 90% of patients are free of reoperation at 15 years when a mechanical valve is used to replace the mitral valve in double valve operations; in contrast, that figure drops to 25% when a stented bioprosthesis is used.

The choice of replacement or repair of the mitral valve affects the procedure chosen for the aortic position. Patients requiring anticoagulant therapy for atrial fibrillation or recurrent deep vein thrombosis, for example, derive greatest benefit from the durability of mechanical prostheses. Extensive calcification of the mitral valve is usually best treated by mitral valve replacement. Severe mitral stenosis with thickening of the valve and subvalvar apparatus is usually treated by mitral valve replacement.

Figure 13-10 Freedom from reoperation after mitral valve repair or replacement in combined aortic and mitral valve operations. Filled circles represent reoperation after replacement of the mitral valve with a mechanical prosthesis; triangles represent mitral valve replacement with a bioprosthesis; squares represent mitral valve repair in nonrheumatic etiologies; and circles represent mitral valve repair in rheumatic valve etiology. Parametric estimates are represented by solid lines; their confidence limits are suppressed for clarity. (From Gillinov and colleagues. G3)

Repair of both the mitral and aortic valves can be accomplished with acceptable early and late mortality and valverelated morbidity. G4 Unfortunately, the durability of both mitral and aortic valve repairs is limited. Freedom from reoperation for valve dysfunction was 94%, 82%, and 65% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. G4 However, results of repair of rheumatic-type mitral valves decrease between 10 and 15 years.

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Remarkably few data exist to objectively guide management of multiple valve disease. Each case must be considered individually, and management must be based on hemodynamics and ventricular function as well as on the probable benefit of medical vs. surgical intervention. The most logical approach is to operate when valvar disease produces more than mild symptoms, or, in the case of dominant aortic valve stenosis, when patients have only mild symptoms. In regurgitant dominant lesions, surgery can be delayed until symptoms of LV dysfunction develop in asymptomatic patients. Use of vasodilators to delay surgery in mixed valve disease is untested.

Aortic and mitral valve operation is required when the patient's symptoms are important (NYHA functional class III or greater) despite an appropriate and intense medical regimen. Such an approach—more conservative than that with isolated mitral or aortic valve replacement—is indicated by the higher early and late risks of double valve replacement and the probably increased late morbidity when there are two rather than one artificial devices in situ. Despite these early and late risks, outcome after double valve replacement is surely superior to what can be accomplished with nonsurgical means. Because of the markedly increased risks with advanced heart disease, it is unwise to insist on severe limitation (NYHA class IV) before recommending double or triple valve surgery.

It is particularly unwise to keep deferring operation until it suddenly becomes necessary to perform an emergency operation on a class V patient, because then the early and late risks become high.

Exceptions to these general indications are cases of combined aortic and mitral regurgitation. These patients are advised to undergo operation when LV enlargement is grade 2 or higher (based on grades 1 to 6), even though symptoms are absent or mild. Otherwise, there is a strong tendency to develop extreme LV enlargement before symptoms become important, considerably lowering long-term survival and increasing the probability of developing ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death.

Patients with active rheumatic carditis, severe aortic and mitral regurgitation, and critical heart failure must be operated on when it is clear that the acute episode is not subsiding. Patients with severe aortic and mitral regurgitation and active bacterial endocarditis in whom neither infection nor heart failure can be controlled medically must also undergo operation without delay (see Chapter 15).

#### SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

# Multiple Valve Replacement Through Small Incisions

It has become possible to perform almost all cardiac valve operations through incisions smaller than standard median sternotomy. Experience and familiarity with smaller incisions have shown that exposure of cardiac valves is not compromised, and even though the smaller incision provides more confined dimensions within which the surgeon must work, results have been equivalent. The frequency with which the minimally invasive approach to cardiac valves is used has increased, but it is still a small fraction of the total.<sup>A4</sup>

A lower half partial sternotomy approach may be considered for any cardiac valve operation. This approach allows the minimally invasive operation not only in isolated single valve replacement but also in complex cardiac valve operations. The incision is centered over the location of the cardiac valves. Cadaveric dissections performed by Reardon and colleagues affirm the lower half sternotomy exposure. They found the pulmonary valve behind the third left costal cartilage, the aortic valve behind the sternum opposite the third intercostal space, and the mitral and tricuspid valves related to the fourth costal cartilage and fourth interspace.

Operations on the aortic valve are facilitated by dividing the ascending aorta above the sinutubular junction. The aortic root may then be positioned for direct visualization, allowing precise examination. The mitral valve approach through standard left atriotomy posterior to the intraatrial groove on the right side is comfortable and familiar to the surgeon. When aortic and mitral valve operations are combined, the mitral valve is easily accessible through the superior aspect of the left atrium, especially with the aorta divided and aortic root retracted inferiorly. A transatrial septal approach is used (1) when the mitral valve is repaired or replaced in conjunction with operations on the tricuspid valve, or (2) for triple valve operations.

Complex operations are easier when the transverse section of the sternum is through the second intercostal space. The longer the sternal incision, the less the incision qualifies as minimally invasive. Nevertheless, it is unwise to compromise exposure or needlessly confine the incision to the point that the operation becomes tedious and prolonged. When either the third or second interspace is used, the entire manubrium remains intact, along with the clavicular attachment. This should be of substantial benefit to the patient in terms of chest wall stability after operation and should eliminate the possibility of dehiscence of the sternal repair at the manubrium.

Small-diameter cannulae as used in vacuum-assisted venous return considerably aid placement of aortic and venous cannulae through the primary incision. Vacuum-assisted venous return has also been helpful in providing more reserve and safety in the venous drainage system to the reservoir of the oxygenator (see "Vacuum-Assisted Venous Return" in Chapter 2). The right heart remains empty and collapsed more consistently than with gravity drainage, and air entrainment with air lock, frequently seen with gravity drainage, is eliminated. This and other advances in cardiopulmonary technology have made operating through a small incision easier, and the technology is transferable to full sternotomy operations.

Doty and colleagues studied the partial sternotomy (lower half) approach in 16 patients undergoing double valve operations.D2 One patient died (6.3%). Triple valve operations were performed in five patients, none of whom died. They concluded that this approach provides a smaller, less invasive incision through which essentially all cardiac valve operations may be performed. It provides standard exposure to the cardiac valves, and standard instruments and retraction devices are employed. Maintaining the integrity of the manubrium and upper sternum should be beneficial for patient mobilization and rehabilitation after operation, and the smaller incision is appreciated by patients of all ages. Atik and colleagues studied hospital outcomes of 114 patients undergoing less invasive (upper sternotomy) combined valve surgery compared with 381 patients undergoing full sternotomy combined valve operations during 1995 through 2003.A4 Among propensity-matched patients, mediastinal drainage was less and early pulmonary function better after less invasive surgery, but otherwise, complications, mortality, pain scores, and length of hospital stay were similar.

# **13A Survival and Related Matters**

This appendix discusses survival and related matters in patients undergoing simultaneous combined aortic and mitral valve replacement, with or without concomitant cardiac procedures, and excluding only those patients with a previous aortic or mitral valve replacement operation (UAB group, 1967-1981, *n* = 569). Follow-up extended to 22 years.
