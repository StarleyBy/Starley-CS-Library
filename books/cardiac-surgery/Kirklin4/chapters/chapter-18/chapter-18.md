#### DEFINITION

Cardiac tumors include benign and malignant neoplasms arising within the cardiac chambers or in the myocardium. Metastatic neoplasms to the heart are not included.

#### HISTORICAL NOTE

First recognition of a heart tumor is attributed to Columbus in 1559,C14 followed by Malpighi, who in 1666 wrote a dissertation entitled "De polypo cordis."M3 Morgagni wrote of heart tumors in 1762. By 1931, Yater was able to publish an extensive dissertation and tabulation of primary cardiac tumors using a classification similar to that used today.Y1 Clinical diagnosis of a primary tumor—a sarcoma—was first recorded in 1934.B3 The first antemortem diagnosis of a myxoma was made in 1951 using angiography.G4 A major diagnostic landmark was echocardiographic diagnosis of a left atrial myxoma in 1968, which was confirmed at operation and successfully treated.S3 In 1934, Beck partly removed an intrapericardial teratoma, and in 1951 Maurer successfully excised an intrapericardial lipoma.B7,M7 Among the earliest surgical approaches to myxomas was that of Bahnson and Newman, who in 1952 removed a myxoma from the right atrium via a right anterior thoracotomy using a short period of caval occlusion at normothermia. The patient died 24 days later of complications related to transfusion and electrolyte imbalance.B1 Using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), Crafoord in 1954 successfully excised a myxoma from the left atrium, as did Bigelow in 1955, using hypothermia and inflow occlusion.B11,C20 Successful excision of a right atrial myxoma was reported in 1957 and in 1958.C13,H1 A left ventricular myxoma was excised in 1959 by Kay.K3 The first successful excision of a right ventricular myxoma was reported in 1960.B20 By 1964, 60 intracardiac myxomas had been successfully removed.M2 Biatrial myxomas were first removed in 1967.Y3 In 1967, Gerbode and colleagues described recurrence of a left atrial myxoma 4 years after initial excision.G3

#### TYPES OF CARDIAC TUMORS

In a study from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, approximately 70% of cardiac tumors were benign and 30% malignant and potentially capable of invasion or metastasis (Table 18-1).M9 In a more recent study of 533 primary tumors removed surgically, 10% were malignant.B18

# **Section I Myxoma**

#### DEFINITION

*Cardiac myxomas* are primary cardiac tumors that are generally pedunculated but may have a broad base. Cells are uniform, small, and polygonal, with round or oval nuclei and a moderate amount of cytoplasm. They lie in a myxomatous stroma in which other elements may be seen. One feature that distinguishes them from thrombi is that they are covered by endothelium and have endothelium-lined crevices and clefts.W5

#### MORPHOLOGY

Myxomas are intracavitary tumors occurring within any of the cardiac chambers, but they have a predilection for the atria, particularly the left. They are usually 5 to 6 cm in diameter, with a range of 1 to 15 cm. Characteristically, they are polypoid and pedunculated, projecting into a cardiac chamber. They can be gelatinous or mucoid, often with areas of hemorrhage. Generally, they are not sessile but have a short, broadbased attachment. The external surface of papillary forms of the neoplasm consists of a frondlike mass that is friable and likely to produce emboli.M10

#### Histology

Myxomas are composed of cells, primitive capillaries, and foci of extramedullary hematopoiesis within a myxoid matrix of acid mucopolysaccharide. The stroma contains variable numbers of reticulocytes and elastin fibers, smooth muscle cells, and collagen deposits. The matrix also contains polygonal cells with scant eosinophilic cytoplasm, either single and stellate or multinuclear and in small nests. At the periphery of the tumor, the cells form a monolayer with clustering in the crevices, thereby simulating primitive capillaries. The stalk has abundant large arteries and veins that communicate with the subendocardium, and at this interface, lymphocytes and plasma cells are prominent. Microscopic foci of calcium and areas of metaplastic bone are found in 10% of myxomas.M10,M16 The nucleus of the polygonal cells is typically irregular and slightly hyperchromatic, but mitoses are not seen.M16 The cells contain fine parallel filaments similar to those seen in glomangioma and fibromyxosarcoma. These filaments are believed to be the contractile components of smooth muscle cells. Immunologically identifiable smooth muscle–type filaments are recognized in endocardial cells, which are more abundant in the left atrium, especially in the region of the fossa ovalis, than in other chambers.M16

#### Tumor Biology

The notion that myxomas are derived from thrombi has been thoroughly dispelled.H8 Ferrans and Roberts believe the organelle content of myxoma cells does not provide sufficient information to determine the cell of origin.F5 Although myxoma cells have a "vasoformative" tendency, in their view the cytoarchitectural features of the variously differentiated blood vessel–like structures differ from those of normal blood vessels. Thus, myxomas are considered to arise from pluripotential mesenchymal cells capable of differentiating into various types of cells, a view supported by the finding of bone and bone marrow tissue in myxomas. Histologic examination of the atrial septum in 11 autopsied patients younger than age 4 months revealed myxomatous or myxofibrous tissue in the endocardium near the fossa ovalis, further supporting the concept that myxomas are derived from embryonal undifferentiated mesenchymal cells,F5 perhaps during endothelial-mesenchymal transformation, leading to cardiac septation and valve formation.O3

Based on immunohistochemical identification of three neuroendocrine markers in 24 excised atrial myxomas, Krikler and colleagues have suggested that these tumors originate from endocardial sensory nerve tissue.K11 Occasional association of cardiac myxomas with cutaneous leiomyomatosis and systemic findings such as fever, hypergammaglobulinemia, and weight loss resemble manifestations of other tumors of neural origin. Increasing numbers of reports document the malignant potential of myxomas. Extensive local invasion has been noted.H2 Death attributable to metastatic spread of an atrial myxoma was once reported as a result of fatal brainstem compression from an expanding cerebellar mass with histologic features identical to those of a large, pedunculated left atrial myxoma also found at autopsy.B26 There have been many reports of local recurrence and of distant metastases with invasion of vessel walls, aneurysmal change, and independent growth.D1,G3,K1,K5,P3,P8,R1,R2,R3,S9 Transgression beyond a blood vessel has also been noted.P12

#### Atrial Myxoma

Most atrial myxomas, whether left or right, arise from the atrial septum, usually from the region of the limbus of the fossa ovalis. About 10% have other sites of origin, particularly the posterior and anterior atrial walls and the appendage (in order of frequency).M10 Importantly, atrial masses thought to be myxomas but not originating from the intraatrial septum may have more complex pathology. On the left atrial side, they may be extensions of hilar lung tumors such as mesothelioma, sarcoma, or carcinoma. On the right side, they may be intracaval extensions of renal or uterine tumors. Most myxomas—80% to 90%—are in the left atrium.B18 Right atrial myxomas tend to be more solid and sessile than left atrial myxomas, with a wider attachment to the atrial wall or septum.O1,S2 In one reported case, an atrial myxoma presenting in the right atrium arose from the inferior vena cava.D4 Atrial myxomas may be multicentric (within a single chamber) or biatrial. The most common arrangement (75%) of biatrial tumors involves attachment of two stalks to opposite sides of the same area of the septum.I1 Of 312 cases of right and left atrial myxomas reviewed by Newman and colleagues, only two were complicated by presence of an atrial septal defectN7; Natarajan and colleagues reported four cases.N4 Such cases may have right-to-left shunts.

#### Ventricular Myxoma

Found commonly on the right ventricular free wall or ventricular septum, ventricular myxomas are sometimes described as infiltrating the ventricular myocardium. In about 15% of reported cases, right ventricular myxomas are associated with other cardiac myxomas. Left ventricular myxomas are rare.M14 Both right and left ventricular myxomas can extend into the outflow tract and cause partial outflow tract obstruction.E2

#### Valvar Myxoma

Myxomas arising from the mitral, tricuspid, or pulmonary valves have been reported.C6,S1,S26,T2

#### CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

#### Pathophysiology

Myxomas may produce (1) symptoms of hemodynamic derangement from obstruction of flow within the cardiac chambers or deformation of a cardiac valve, (2) symptoms associated with embolization, and (3) constitutional symptoms, the least common manifestation.G16,V6 In rare circumstances, atrial myxomas may become infected; only 2 of 12 reported cases were diagnosed before death.G14,J3 Central nervous system embolism has been a constant association.

#### *Hemodynamic Derangement*

Myxomas may obstruct pulmonary or systemic venous drainage or may impair flow across the atrioventricular valves, the likelihood of these events being greater with larger tumors. The obstruction is characteristically progressive.G16 When obstruction is intermittent, syncope, often related to postural change, or sudden death may occur. This happens in less than one fourth of patients with left atrial myxomas, about one third of those with right atrial or right ventricular myxomas, and about half of those with left ventricular myxo mas.G4,G16,H8,M14,M22,S8 Impairment of valve closure, either by obstruction or leaflet damage, may cause regurgitation.P7 Valves may be structurally damaged by frequent tumor impingement, a sequence that also causes regurgitation. Although regurgitation is the dominant abnormality, obstruction predominates in a few patients.H4 Symptoms are commonly of short duration, are episodic, and may be associated with syncope.G11

#### *Embolism*

A major feature of cardiac myxomas is embolization. Emboli may arise from tumor fragmentation or detachment of the entire tumor, or from thrombi or infected foci on the surface of the neoplasm.B23 Systemic emboli occur in 30% to 45% of patients with left atrial myxomas.F9 They have been reported in every organ and may occlude coronary arteries.E1,F7,S13,S27 About 50% of emboli involve intracranial or extracranial arteries to the central nervous system.D3,S13,S28,T4 Cerebral emboli characteristically cause major permanent neurologic deficits. On rare occasions, they are amenable to excision.B8,B26,D3,T4 Large emboli may obstruct the aortic bifurcation.C5 Although left ventricular myxomas are rare, prevalence of embolism from them is high (64%), apparently unrelated to tumor size, and greater to the brain than elsewhere.M14 Left atrial myxomas that come to attention because of embolization tend to be small when examined after that event.F9 Embolism from right-sided tumors occurs in about 10% of cases and may cause massive fatal pulmonary obstruction.G8 However, pulmonary arterial obstruction from this mechanism is much less common than true thromboembolism to the pulmonary arteries in patients who have sustained systemic tumor emboli from a left atrial myxoma.G10,G16 Multiple emboli from right-sided tumors may be a cause of pulmonary hypertension.V7 Paradoxical embolism is rare.N4,P11

#### *Constitutional Manifestations*

In about 30% of patients, the only manifestation of a cardiac myxoma is a plethora of constitutional symptoms and certain laboratory findings. Large left atrial myxomas are particularly apt to produce constitutional symptoms.F9 Symptoms include fever, weight loss, clubbing of the fingers and toes, Raynaud phenomenon, and myalgia and arthralgia.B25,S18 By themselves, these findings are not pathognomonic. Because the presence of antibodies to fresh heart muscle has been demonstrated preoperatively in some patients, with appropriate postoperative diminution, it is speculated that an immune reaction to the neoplasm or to heart muscle mediated by presence of the neoplasm may cause the constitutional symptoms.C22 Total globulin levels are often elevated, and the electrophoretic patterns may reveal prominent α2-, β1-, or heterogeneous γ-globulin peaks. Immunoelectrophoresis localizes the elevated globulins in either the immunoglobulin (Ig)M or IgA fractions. Elevated globulin levels are associated with an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels.H5 Further nonspecific symptoms may be related to seeding of multiple small emboli in muscle and joints, and hemorrhage or degeneration within the tumor. Other unusual manifestations of cardiac myxomas include polycythemia with or without associated arterial hypoxia, and clubbing (with both left and right atrial myxomas) associated with a right-to-left shunt at the atrial level through a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect.G10,M17,S8,W4 Hemolytic anemia occurs in about one third of cases, particularly in association with a calcified myxoma; this and the thrombocytopenia that sometimes occurs are probably due to mechanical destruction of formed blood elements. These features are reversible with tumor removal.V12,W4

#### Familial versus Nonfamilial Myxoma

Nearly all solitary myxomas have a normal DNA ploidy, and nearly all are nonfamilial. Nonfamilial ("sporadic") cardiac myxomas are disorders primarily of middle-aged women. The tumors are usually single (94%) and in the left atrium (about 75%); they uncommonly have associated conditions, they rarely recur, and only about 20% have abnormal DNA ploidy.M12

Myxomas have a familial occurrence in about 5% of patients.C2 They have a pattern of Mendelian dominant inheritanceC4 and are primarily disorders of young men. They are less common in the left atrium (62%), are more often multiple (33%), and in about 20% of patients are associated with unusual conditions. These conditions include Sertoli cell tumors of the testes, Cushing syndrome as a result of primary adrenocortical nodular dysplasia, pituitary tumors, centrofacial and labial lentiginosis (brown macules with regular edges, sometimes termed *spotty pigmentation*), cutaneous myxomas, and multiple myxoid mammary fibroadenomas.C11,V4,V6 Familial myxomas have the same histologic appearance as nonfamilial myxomas and produce the same symptoms. However, they have a strong tendency to recur.M12 Some patients with these complex findings have no identifiable cardiac myxoma; in a few others the myxoma has been found unexpectedly at autopsy.C3,C11 Familial cardiac myxomas are aneuploid in virtually all cases,M12 supporting the concept that they are neoplasms.D5

#### Symptoms

*Left atrial myxomas* produce symptoms similar to those of mitral stenosis (see Chapter 11) in most patients, with dyspnea and hemoptysis predominating.B27,G3,L1,N3 Symptoms are commonly of short duration, episodic, and associated with syncope.G11 They may rapidly become severe and intractable and are associated with heart failure. *Right atrial myxomas* may also produce episodic symptoms, and these may progress rapidly. Abdominal protuberance from hepatomegaly and ascites and peripheral edema are frequent presenting complaints.M22 In the review by Morrisey and colleagues, all 18 patients had right heart failure, with a prominent *a* wave, raised venous pressure, hepatomegaly, ascites, and peripheral edemaM22; absence of orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea was notable. Symptoms that result from embolization include neurologic deficits, coldness and pain in an extremity, angina or infarction from coronary embolization, and dyspnea from pulmonary embolization. Constitutional symptoms may be subtle or absent when the tumor is small, but occasionally constitute the entire symptomatology.H4

#### Signs

Diagnosis of atrial myxoma is sometimes made immediately after hospital admission by histologic examination of an embolus removed from a peripheral artery.K8 However, absence of myxoma cells in the embolus does not rule out myxoma, because thrombus forming on the neoplasm may be the cause of the embolism. Before the advent of echocardiography, interpretation of auscultatory findings for *left atrial myxomas* was aided by a combination of phonocardiographic and hemodynamic studies.P7,P9 A loud first heart sound is prolonged by vibrations coinciding with the *c* wave of the left atrial pressure tracing and also with a characteristic notch in the left ventricular pressure curve; these vibrations occur after mitral valve closure when the tumor momentarily comes to rest in the left atrium.P7 For mobile tumors moving from the left ventricle to the left atrium in early systole, a notch in the ascending limb of the left ventricular pressure tracing is attributed to a sudden increase in left atrial volume, which itself is manifested in the left atrial pressure pulse by a prominent *c* wave and subsequent dominant *v* wave. Accordingly, the first heart sound may be preceded by a loud ejection sound resulting from forceful ejection of the tumor from the left ventricle back into the left atrium.

When the tumor stays in the left atrium during the entire cardiac cycle, the diastolic murmur and pressure tracings may be indistinguishable from those of mitral stenosis (i.e., there is no notch in the ventricular pressure wave, and the *y* descent is relatively slow). The second heart sound is normally split, of low intensity, and followed by a third heart sound described as either an opening snap or a ventricular gallop. The opening snap occurs after the mitral valve opens and is thought to be due either to the tumor striking the heart wall or to the diastolic sound of mitral regurgitation caused by increased blood flow. Systolic murmurs have also been recorded and have been attributed to associated mitral regurgitation.P7,P9

With *right atrial myxomas,* a loud early systolic sound is heard, usually regarded as a widely split first heart sound, corresponding to expulsion of the tumor from the right ventricle.H8 This sound is likely to correspond to a notch in the upstroke of the right ventricular pressure curve.R12 A pulmonary ejection murmur with a delayed and accentuated pulmonic second sound and an early, late, or prolonged tricuspid diastolic murmur or rumble is heard.S21 A systolic murmur is due to tricuspid regurgitation.

*Ventricular myxomas* are sufficiently rare that their auscultatory features are not fully known, but murmurs may suggest aortic or pulmonary stenosis.B20 Occasionally, friction rubs are heard, presumably a result of physical contact of the tumor with the endocardium of one of the cardiac chambers.H8 Rarely, patients presenting with constitutional manifestations exhibit cyanosis and clubbing of the fingers and toes, or a gallop rhythm and sinus tachycardia.G10,H4,M17,S8,W4

#### Laboratory Studies

Results of laboratory studies are usually normal. In rare instances of presentation with constitutional manifestations, some findings may be characteristic but not pathognomonic. Among them are anemia, thrombocytopenia, and findings associated with an immune response (see "Constitutional Manifestations" earlier in this section).

#### Electrocardiography

Electrocardiographic findings associated with myxomas are not specific, but include arrhythmias and conduction disturbances, particularly atrial fibrillation and bundle branch block, and abnormal P waves.

#### Chest Radiography

Features on a plain chest radiograph are not specific. Generalized cardiomegaly or specific chamber enlargement may be evident, particularly in the case of large left atrial myxomas causing obstruction. Septal lines, especially at the base and in the mid-zone of the lung, are fairly common findings because of coexisting pulmonary venous hypertension.S23

#### Echocardiography

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) supplemented by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has become the most appropriate screening and diagnostic imaging modality for myxomas (and most other cardiac tumors).P10,V8 Mitral valve stenosis can be excluded, and tumor prolapse through the atrioventricular valve may be demonstrated. Tumor prolapse is characteristically evident if echoes are seen behind the anterior leaflet, particularly if they move into the left ventricle during diastole.B5 Echocardiography is invaluable in identifying the precise origin of the myxoma (Figs. 18-1, 18-2).K9,T6

#### Computed Tomographic and Magnetic Resonance Imaging

Atrial myxomas and other cardiac tumors can also be identified with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), either alone or in combination with echocardiography.A1 Asymptomatic tumors are occasionally identified when CT or MRI scans are performed for other indications.

#### Cardiac Catheterization and Angiography

Unless other types of cardiac or coronary artery disease require assessment, catheterization and angiography no longer constitute the investigative method of choice.V3 If invasive study is required for suspected left atrial tumors, a selective right heart study is performed by injecting radiopaque media into the pulmonary artery and filming as the dye passes through the left atrium. This method usually gives a clear demonstration of the tumor, whereas selective left ventricular cineangiography often fails to delineate it. For right atrial myxomas, catheter placement into the right atrium is contraindicated, and injection is made into one of the venae cavae.

#### NATURAL HISTORY

Myxomas occur in older adults and are two to three times more common in women than in men. They are rare in

children and have not been described in infants.A3,N1,P1,S5,S21,S24 MacGowan and colleagues estimate the incidence of atrial myxoma to be 0.5 per million population per year.M1 The older literature contains reports of familial myxoma (three restricted to siblings and three with a parent-child rel ationship).C21,K7,K10,P11 Current knowledge indicates that the natural history of patients with familial myxomas is different from that of patients with nonfamilial, sporadically occurring myxomas (see "Familial versus Nonfamilial Myxoma" under Clinical Features and Diagnostic Criteria earlier in this section).

Myxomas are usually benign, but rarely the tumor metastasizes.R1,R3 Metastases have been reported in brain arteries, sternum, vertebral column, pelvis, scapula, and soft tissues of the back.A4,B8,B26,R1,R3,S9 Metastasis can occur despite benign gross and microscopic appearances, but it is rare.R2 The course of surgically untreated patients with cardiac myxomas is highly variable and cannot be clearly defined. However, once symptoms of dyspnea and hemoptysis develop in the case of left atrial myxomas, or symptoms of abdominal protuberance from ascites or hepatomegaly develop in the case of right atrial myxomas, death usually follows within 1 to 2 years. Little information is available about the frequency of embolization in patients with myxomas, the tendency to repeated embolization if the tumor is not removed, or the course without treatment of patients presenting with constitutional symptoms only.

# TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

Single, nonfamilial left atrial myxomas in patients older than about age 50 can simply be excised. Familial myxomas in younger patients should be treated more aggressively.M11,W1 Preparations for operation, median sternotomy, CPB, and myocardial management are the usual ones for adult cardiac surgery (see "Preparation for Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2 and "Methods of Myocardial Management during Cardiac Surgery" in Chapter 3). Direct caval cannulation is routinely practiced for removal of atrial myxomas. A left atrial vent is not used.

![](_page_5_Figure_12.jpeg)

#### Left Atrial Myxoma

The approach is biatrial. For initial exploration and orientation, the usual incision is made in the left atrium posterior to the interatrial groove (Fig. 18-3, A). Blood is removed from the left atrium, and the point of attachment of the tumor to the atrium is determined by inspection (Fig. 18-3, B). Assuming it is attached to the atrial septum, which is usually the case, the tumor is not removed from the left atrium. Instead, an oblique right atriotomy is made and the interior of the right atrium examined in case a second tumor is present (Fig. 18-3, C). As much as possible of the interior of the right ventricle is also inspected through the tricuspid valve. The atrial septum is then opened with a knife near the center of the fossa ovalis, and a sufficient

amount of atrial septum is excised to include the tumor attachment and, if possible, uninvolved tissue 5 mm beyond it. The superior half of the fossa ovalis and adjacent limbus are, if possible, included in the excision, because cells thought to be the precursor of myxoma are more abundant in this area. The tumor is then removed from the heart through the left or right atriotomy, whichever is larger (Fig. 18-3, D). Very large tumors may have to be removed piecemeal, although every attempt is made to keep the tumor intact and to avoid tumor embolization. After the tumor is removed, the interior of the left atrium is copiously irrigated with saline solution to evacuate any residual tumor fragments. The defect in the atrial septum is closed either by direct suture or, if too large for this, with a pericardial or synthetic patch (Fig. 18-3, E).

![](_page_6_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Figure 18-3** Resection of left atrial myxoma. **A,** Two atrial incisions are used. Tumor is explored via left atrial incision (*dashed line*). Later, tumor will be removed from right atrial approach. **B,** As for exposure of mitral valve, left atrium is opened and explored and attachment of myxoma to atrial septum identified. (Tumor may be isolated from pulmonary vein orifices at this point by small packing sponges.) **C,** From opened right atrium, tumor attachment to atrial septum is usually apparent.

![](_page_7_Picture_2.jpeg)

**D,** Via its circumscribed septal attachment, myxoma is delivered into right atrium. **E,** Atrial septal defect is closed using pericardial or synthetic patch. **Figure 18-3, cont'd**

If the tumor is attached to the left atrial wall rather than the septum, the zone of attachment is excised, preferably with the full thickness of the adjacent wall, but if this is impracticable, with endocardium and some underlying muscle. The wall defect created can be closed by direct suture or with a patch of autologous or bovine pericardium. The atria are closed and usual precautions against air embolization taken (see "De-airing the Heart" in Section III of Chapter 2). The rest of the procedure is completed in standard fashion.

#### Right Atrial Myxoma

Separate left and right atriotomies are not necessary unless there is preoperative evidence of an associated left atrial myxoma. Instead, the right atrium only is opened by the usual oblique incision (see Chapter 30, Fig. 30-14), and after attachments of the tumor are defined, it is excised with the adjacent portion of atrial septum in the manner described in the preceding text. The left atrium is then carefully inspected via the surgically created atrial septal defect. Only if a tumor is seen in the left atrium is that chamber opened by a separate incision. The atrial septal defect is closed as described in the preceding text, and the remainder of the procedure is completed as described.

#### Other Myxomas

Removal of ventricular myxomas does not require excision of full-thickness ventricular wall, because such a procedure would increase risk and no recurrences have been recorded

following less radical removal. Tumors in the left ventricular outflow tract can sometimes be removed via an aortic approach.G3 Otherwise, the approach is through the right atrium for right ventricular tumors and left atrium for left ventricular tumors.B20,B21 The ventricle is opened directly only when the atrial approach is inadequate for tumor removal. The procedure should include careful inspection of the interior of both right and left atria to exclude the presence of additional atrial tumors, which have been found in 15% of patients with right ventricular myxomas.B20

In those rare instances in which the tumor arises from an atrioventricular valve, the valve usually requires replacement. Also, valve replacement is occasionally required because of leaflet disruption or distortion from the "wrecking ball" action of the tumor (see Fig. 18-2). A markedly enlarged atrioventricular valve anulus may require anuloplasty to correct residual valve regurgitation. Such enlargement is particularly likely to occur in the tricuspid valve, because the tricuspid anulus is more easily overstretched by a bulky tumor than is the mitral anulus.

#### SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Postoperative management is conducted in the usual fashion (see Chapter 5).

#### RESULTS

#### Survival

#### *Early (Hospital) Death*

Hospital mortality after removal of atrial myxomas is less than 5% (Table 18-2). Virtually all deaths are in patients with advanced disability or old age, the mode of death being generally related not to the atrial myxoma but to coexisting cardiac or degenerative disease. Early risks seem somewhat higher after removal of myxomas from the ventricular cavities. Among 32 patients who underwent removal of right ventricular myxoma, there were three hospital deaths (9%; CL 4%-18%), and among 14 patients in whom a left ventricular myxoma was removed, there were three hospital deaths (21%; CL 10%-38%).B20,L1,M14,S2,S14

![](_page_8_Figure_15.jpeg)

**Figure 18-4** Time-related survival of 54 hospital survivors after removal of intracardiac myxomas. No death was related to recurrence of the myxoma, which was observed in no case. (From Bortolotti and colleagues.B19)

#### *Time-Related Survival*

Death after hospital discharge is uncommon, but recurrence of the myxoma (see "Recurrence" later in this section) can lead to fatal complications. Most other late deaths are from causes other than the cardiac tumor. Excellent long-term results have been reported in a number of studies (Fig. 18-4).B19,D6,N5 Presumably, these contained only patients with nonfamilial myxomas. Too few patients with familial myxomas have been reported for adequate assessment of long-term survival. Presumably, their survival is considerably worse than that of those with nonfamilial myxomas. Premature late death may occur more commonly when prosthetic valve replacement is necessary at time of myxoma removal because of complications from the prosthesis.R8,S22

#### Recurrence

What has been classified as recurrence can be due to (1) tumor implantation (seeding at the time of removal), (2) incomplete removal, or (3) growth from a new focus (multicentric origin). Recurrence of a "sporadic" myxoma is unusual, occurring in only about 1% to 3% of patients, and myxomas with a normal ploidy rarely recur.M11,M12 In contrast, 30% to 75% of patients with familial myxomas experience

Includes Crafoord's case, the first successful procedure worldwide.

recurrence.M11 When the tumor exhibits an abnormal ploidy, 40% of patients experience recurrence.M12 A first recurrence is often followed by a second, and recurrence may be in a cardiac chamber that was not the site of the original tumor.G15,P4 Recurrences may become apparent as early as 6 months and as late as 11 years after excision, but the average is about 30 months after removal of the first myxoma.G15,M11 At least one patient has experienced recurrence of a left ventricular myxoma; it involved the aortic valve and necessitated valve replacement.M5

#### Postoperative Arrhythmias

Atrial arrhythmias are common after removal of atrial myxomas.B6 Conduction disturbances are also reported and may be related to failure to limit resection to safe areas of the atrial septum or wall.

#### Functional Status

Living patients are generally in good health unless they have other disease processes or residual effects from a preoperative embolic event.H3

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Surgical removal is indicated whenever diagnosis of cardiac myxoma is made. Historically, it was considered an urgent procedure, particularly if the patient had a history of embolism or syncope, because it had been noted that 8% to 10% of patients died of embolic complications while awaiting operation.N7,S28,T3 However, more recent experience suggests that elective operation (as opposed to urgent) has resulted in no greater mortality or morbidity.

# SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

Yu and colleagues in China have reported totally thorascopic surgical resection, often left atrial and two right atrial myxomas, using peripheral cannulation for CPB.Y4

# **Section II Papillary Fibroelastoma**

#### DEFINITION

Papillary fibroelastomas are benign tumors representing less than 10% of all cardiac tumors, and they are important because, like myxomas, they are a curable and identifiable cause of strokes and other embolic events.

#### MORPHOLOGY

Papillary fibroelastomas are usually small tumors but may extensively involve structures such as the mitral valve.G12 They have characteristic papillary fronds, which can be recognized grossly (Fig. 18-5). At times they have been thought to be myxomas, but their histologic appearance is diagnostic. The fronds have a central core of dense connective tissue sometimes lined by hyperplastic endocardial tissue. They have been said to resemble normal chordae tendineae.M6

![](_page_9_Picture_16.jpeg)

**Figure 18-5** Papillary fibroelastoma removed from left ventricular outflow tract. (From Vivacqua and colleagues.V9)

Papillary fibroelastomas usually develop on a valve leaflet, most commonly an aortic cusp or mitral leaflet. Less commonly, they appear on the tricuspid valve and ventricular septum, or rarely, on the aortic wall.F6,F8,O2,Y2

# CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

This uncommon tumor rarely appears to cause trouble at its site of origin.I2,Y2 More often, it is responsible for embolization, either by detachment and embolization of one or more of its fronds or by inciting thrombus formation on its surface, with subsequent thromboembolism. Reported sites of embolism include primarily the brain and coronary arteries.G12,M8,M13,T5 They have also been observed in the lungs and retinal arteries.W2,Z1 Diagnosis in all living patients has been made by echocardiography and most accurately by TTE and TEE with Doppler color flow interrogation.D2,F8,G12,O2,S7,S12,S25,T5 Characteristically, by echocardiographic interrogation the tumor is small (about 1 cm2 ), usually pedunculated and mobile, with a homogenous speckled pattern and stippling along its edgesK6 (Fig. 18-6).

#### NATURAL HISTORY

Little is known about the natural history of papillary fibroelastomas of the heart, except that they tend to produce emboli. Embolization is the presumed mechanism of sudden death in some patients.

#### TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

Preserving the involved valve is possible in most patients when the tumor is small.G17,R14,T5 Monitoring the repair by intraoperative TEE is important. The only choice for treatment of multicentric extensive papillary fibroelastomas is valve replacement.G12

## SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Usual care (see Chapter 5) is appropriate. Postoperative echocardiographic evaluation of the competence of any repaired valve is advisable.

**Figure 18-6** Transesophageal echocardiogram of papillary fibroelastoma on left cusp of aortic valve. Key: *LA,* Left atrium; *LV,* left ventricle; *LVOT,* left ventricular outflow tract. (From Comfort and colleagues.C15)

#### RESULTS

Tumor recurrences have not been reported.

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

When a cardiac papillary fibroelastoma is discovered in a patient who has experienced an embolic event, removal is indicated. Whether the incidental finding of such a tumor is an indication for removal is arguable; when the tumor is on the mitral or aortic valve or the left ventricular endocardium, removal is advisable in patients at low risk for operative intervention.

# **Section III Rhabdomyoma**

#### DEFINITION

Cardiac rhabdomyomas are histologically specific cardiac tumors that tend to occur in patients with tuberous sclerosis. They are probably the same entity termed by some as cardiac hamartomas, Purkinje cell tumors, and histiocytoid cardiomyopathy.G1,N8

### MORPHOLOGY

Cardiac rhabdomyomas are benign, yellow-gray tumors, the microscopic characteristic of which is the so-called spider cell containing a central cytoplasmic mass suspended by fine, fibrillar processes radiating to the periphery. The cells are considered altered myocytes.G1 They are about twice the size of normal myocytes and are round or polygonal, with large hyperchromatic nuclei and eosinophilic granules in the cytoplasm. At times, there is no discrete myocardial tumor but only a gray-white area in the ventricular endocardium.G1 Rhabdomyomas occur almost invariably in the ventricles, with both sides equally involved and commonly in multiple locations. Whether rhabdomyomas are true neoplasms or myocardial hamartomas is controversial, but the latter is generally considered more likely.B24,F4 Consistent with this view is that at least half the patients have tuberous sclerosis, with multiple hamartomatous lesions in the brain. Cardiac rhabdomyomas may be associated with hamartomas in other organs as well.G13

# CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

Cardiac rhabdomyomas are the most common primary tumors in children.A3,B12,G6,M15 They may occur in siblings.S11 Presentation is frequently at birth or in the first few days of life with severe cardiac failure, the result of obstruction of cardiac pathways.S10 Cardiac rhabdomyomas are relatively common findings in infants presenting with incessant ventricular tachycardia.G1 At least one instance has occurred in which a rhabdomyoma of the right atrium caused atrial arrhythmias in an infant.G7 Occasionally the tumor is discovered somewhat later in a child known to have tuberous sclerosis, mental retardation, and in many cases, seizures.

Diagnosis can often be suspected based on clinical features and results of two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography (Fig. 18-7). Cardiac catheterization may be carried out to determine whether inflow to or outflow from the ventricles is obstructed. In some patients, no structural abnormality is found by any imaging technique, and diagnosis is inferred from the findings at electrophysiologic study of an area in the ventricle at which sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia can be induced.G1,R5 Diagnosis has been made in the fetus by 2D echocardiography.B13

#### NATURAL HISTORY

Little documentation exists concerning the natural history of patients with cardiac rhabdomyomas. Bass and colleagues determined by 2D echocardiography that 8 of 16 (50%; CL 36%-64%) infants with tuberous sclerosis had a cardiac rhabdomyoma.B4 Nir and colleagues corroborated a high prevalence of rhabdomyomas in patients with tuberous sclerosis.N9 It was previously assumed that mortality was high in patients with rhabdomyoma, due either to their tumor or to associated tuberous sclerosis. However, there is good documentation of spontaneous regression in number and size of these tumors.N9,T1 Nir and colleagues noted tumor regression in children younger than 4 years, less so in older children.N9

**Figure 18-7** Echocardiogram in coronal section viewed from subxyphoid position. There is a large tumor consistent with a rhabdomyoma in the left ventricle. Key: *LV,* Left ventricle; *RV,* right ventricle; *T,* tumor.

In a 20-year experience, Smythe and colleagues noted regression of tumors in 100% of 24 patients studied by angiography or echocardiography.S20 Twenty had complete resolution.

# TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

Because rhabdomyomas usually protrude into the right or left ventricular cavity, removal is done with the aid of CPB, hypothermic circulatory arrest, or both. Approach may need to be through the ventricular wall, but at times operation can be done through the atrioventricular or semilunar valve.K4 Excision is limited to the area of the tumor. Occasionally, only the intracavitary portion is excised to relieve obstruction. The remaining intramyocardial portion will probably regress. In infants with incessant ventricular tachycardia, the only gross finding may be a grayish-white discoloration of the endocardium at the site identified by electrophysiologic mapping.G1

#### SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Usual postoperative care is given (see Chapter 5). Catecholamine support may be necessary because of the extensive myocardial dissection.C18

#### RESULTS

With appropriate indications, results of surgical treatment are generally satisfactory. Black and colleagues operated on seven patients presenting with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction during a 27-year period; all survived.B16 Importantly, during the same interval, 23 other patients with rhabdomyoma did not need surgical intervention, and all were alive at late follow-up. Spontaneous regression is likely to occur before age 2. In these patients and those treated surgically, if tuberous sclerosis has not developed, a lasting good result can be anticipated.S19,T1

## INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

In the presence of known tuberous sclerosis and severe mental retardation with seizures, operation may be contraindicated, especially if the patient has multiple cardiac tumors and no cardiac symptoms. In the absence of tuberous sclerosis, an aggressive surgical approach is indicated if outflow tract obstruction or major ventricular arrhythmia is present. In patients without arrhythmias, observation may be warranted because of the possibility of spontaneous tumor regression. Should obstruction or arrhythmia occur, operation is indicated.

# **Section IV Fibroma**

#### DEFINITION

Cardiac fibromas are benign tumors, grossly resembling uterine leiomyomas, with a whorled appearance on cut section. Microscopically, cardiac fibromas consist of spindle cells mixed with collagen and elastic fibers. Mitotic figures are rare, and foci of dystrophic calcification are common. Controversy exists as to whether fibromas should also be considered hamartomas.C1,F3,N8

#### MORPHOLOGY

Fibromas occur almost exclusively within the ventricular myocardium and frequently in the ventricular septum.C12,H7 Patients with fibromas coming to surgical treatment tend to have large, bulky tumors that are not infiltrating. They are characteristically solitary, circumscribed, firm, gray-white, and often centrally calcified.C12,G2,R4 They do not have a distinct capsule and may occasionally be multiple.

#### CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

Clinical presentation is variable. Symptoms include dyspnea, syncope, heart failure, and chest pain.B28,C12,P2,V2 Ventricular tachycardia and sudden death have been reported.B28,C12,P2,W6 Currently, echocardiography is the most widely used modality for diagnosis. MRI and cardiac angiography may be useful in defining tissue characteristics and extent of tumor involvement.C12

#### NATURAL HISTORY

Natural history of untreated patients is unknown. The prevalence of asymptomatic ventricular fibromas is also unknown, and it is impossible to predict the exact risk of sudden death. The presumption is that these tumors eventually cause death from ventricular fibrillation or by obstructing ventricular inflow or outflow.V2

#### TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

During CPB and appropriate myocardial management, incision is made through the epicardium and myocardium overlying the tumor. The tumor is enucleated by blunt and sharp dissection, which, even when the tumor is large, is possible. If the tumor involves the septum, reconstruction can be achieved by closing the septum in layers or with a prosthetic patch. Occasionally, mitral valve repair or replacement may be necessary.C12 The ventricle is reconstructed by direct suture. When the tumor is very large and complete removal seems impossible, partial removal may result in good palliation.C7 In infants, children, and young adults who are otherwise in good health, cardiac transplantation should be considered if the tumor is deemed to be unresectable (see Chapter 21).V1

#### SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Usual postoperative care is given (see Chapter 5).

# RESULTS

In a series of 18 patients reported by Cho and colleagues who were treated surgically and followed for up to 34 years, there was one operative death and no late death.C12 Fourteen patients were asymptomatic, one was in New York Heart Association functional class II, and two were in class III. There was no recurrence of tumor and no change in size of residual tumor in the one patient who had subtotal resection.

# INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Diagnosis in a symptomatic patient (often an infant or child) is an indication for operation. Operation should be considered for asymptomatic patients with large tumors to prevent progressive cardiac deformity and atrioventricular valve dysfunction.C12

# **Section V Lipoma**

#### DEFINITION

Cardiac lipomas are tumors typically composed of mature fatty cells. They can be well encapsulated or can diffusely infiltrate the myocardium.

#### MORPHOLOGY

Cardiac lipomas occur most commonly in the atrial septum, a condition termed *lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum*. M9,P13,R6,R7 They can occur in almost any location in the heart. They are characterized by the presence of mature adipose tissue with entrapped myocytes and blood vessels.

### CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

Most lipomas are not associated with symptoms and are incidental findings on imaging studies or at autopsy. Chest pain and exertional dyspnea have been reported.B22,Z2 Occasionally, they can reach large size and have been associated with sudden death, ventricular tachycardia, electrocardiographic abnormalities (ST-T wave changes and conduction defects), and symptoms associated with right or left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.C10,H6,M23,S6,V11 CT and MRI studies are useful for differentiating lipomas from other cardiac tumors.Z2

#### NATURAL HISTORY

The natural history is unknown, because in most cases, cardiac lipomas are incidental findings.

# TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

Using CPB (see Section III of Chapter 2) and standard myocardial management (see "Methods of Myocardial Management during Cardiac Surgery" in Chapter 3), the lipoma is removed. If the tumor arises in the atrial septum, the involved septum should be excised and replaced with a polyester patch. Tumors that involve the ventricles can be removed through the corresponding atrium or through a ventriculotomy.B22,C10,H6,S6

# SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Usual postoperative care is given (see Chapter 5).

#### RESULTS

The prognosis is satisfactory following operation for the majority of patients.B22,C10,M23,S6

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Lipomas should be removed in symptomatic patients and those in whom a large tumor is encountered unexpectedly at operation.

# **Section VI Pheochromocytoma**

#### DEFINITION

Pheochromocytomas are potentially lethal, functionally active chromaffin tumors of the sympathetic nervous system that occur rarely within the pericardium and on the surface of the heart.

#### HISTORICAL NOTE

Occurrence of pheochromocytomas in the middle mediastinum and within the pericardium was unknown until 1960.N2,P5 Occurrence and treatment of cardiac pheochromocytomas were first discussed comprehensively by Orringer and colleagues in 1985.O4

#### MORPHOLOGY

Cardiac pheochromocytomas are soft, fleshy tumors that are usually flattened by the pressure of the pericardium. They are typically benign and have large cellular trabeculae composed of mature pheochromocytes with marked cellular and nuclear pleomorphism. Nests of tumor cells may infiltrate the cardiac tissue. Chromaffin cells, from which these tumors are derived, normally are concentrated in the adrenal medulla, but they occur in small numbers along the aorta, in blood vessel walls, and in various organs including the heart. Pheochromocytomas produce large amounts of catecholamine, primarily norepinephrine, accounting for the hypertension characteristic of patients with these tumors.

#### CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

Severe arterial hypertension is the characteristic finding in patients with pheochromocytomas. Markedly elevated urinary catecholamines are diagnostic. Localization of the pheochromocytoma in the middle mediastinum and heart is accomplished by a combination of CT imaging and scintigraphy with 131-I-metaiodobenzylguanidine or 111-indium diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid octreotide and confirmed by MRI.A2,L2,S16,S17

#### NATURAL HISTORY

Little is known about natural history because of the rarity of cardiac pheochromocytomas. Presumably, it is that of pheochromocytomas and severe hypertension in general. Although pheochromocytomas are usually benign, at least one patient has been reported with widespread metastases.V10

#### TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

Preoperative preparation of the patient with α- and β-adrenergic blocking agents is mandatory, and the anesthesiologist must be familiar with the intraoperative management of paroxysms of arterial hypertension and hypotension that may occur during the course of operation. Interestingly, these seem not to occur once CPB is established. Median sternotomy is probably the most useful incision, and CPB and cardioplegia are generally necessary.

The tumor can be expected to be along the anterior surface of the heart and intimately related to the coronary arteries, including the left main coronary artery, or along the roof (superior aspect) of the left atrium and extending over the pulmonary veins and posterior left atrial wall, or in the area between the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk.A2,O4 The tumor usually cannot be enucleated, but must be dissected away from surrounding structures. It often has a large extracardiac collateral blood supply with potential risk of important hemorrhage. At times, a coronary artery or a portion of the left atrial wall must be included in the resection, and appropriate reconstruction will be necessary.

# SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Usual care after a cardiac surgical procedure is appropriate (see Chapter 5).

# RESULTS

Removing the tumor returns the patient to a normotensive state and results in cure, except in the unusual circumstance when the tumor is malignant. In a review of 26 cases collected from the literature, 25 patients underwent reconstruction within the native heart and one had successful transplantation.J1 Mortality was 24% (CL 15%-36%), with five patients (20%, CL 11%-32%) dying of hemorrhage.

# INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Diagnosis of a mid-mediastinal pheochromocytoma, which usually means a cardiac pheochromocytoma, is an indication for operation.

# **Section VII Teratoma**

# DEFINITION

Teratomas are rare, generally benign, but occasionally malignant tumors of the heart. They are diagnosed in very young patients, but occasionally in adults.F2,G9,M4

#### MORPHOLOGY

Cardiac teratomas are pale cystic masses with the usual histologic heterogeneity characteristic of teratomas. About 20% of cardiac teratomas are microscopically and clinically malignant.C19

#### CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

Presentation is with a variety of symptoms and signs. If the tumor is large, compression of the heart occurs with clinical evidence for tamponade.F1 Diagnosis is made with echocardiography and, not infrequently, in the fetus.G5,K2

# NATURAL HISTORY

If left untreated, the tumor usually leads to cardiac death early in life.C8

#### TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

The tumor is removed by open cardiac surgery, which is usually possible.

# SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Usual postoperative care is given (see Chapter 5).

#### RESULTS

Because of the rarity of the condition, long-term results of surgical treatment are unknown.

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Diagnosis is generally an indication for operation.

# **Section VIII Sarcoma**

#### DEFINITION

Sarcomas are malignant tumors of mesenchymal origin that display a wide variety of morphologic types.

#### MORPHOLOGY

Sarcomas may present as fibrosarcomas, angiosarcomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, or lymphosarcomas.M10 Angiosarcoma is the most common type.S15 Any of the cardiac chambers may be involved. Right heart sarcomas tend to be bulky and infiltrative, cause heart failure, and metastasize early.B17 Left heart sarcomas tend to be more circumscribed and less infiltrative, cause heart failure early, and metastasize later.B17 Sarcomas tend to metastasize widely.

#### CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

Presenting symptoms are nonspecific and include fever, malaise, and weight loss. Presence of a pericardial effusion is not uncommon. Heart failure is a late manifestation, and distant metastasis may already be present. Echocardiography, CT, and MRI are used for diagnosis.

## NATURAL HISTORY

Prognosis is poor for untreated patients with cardiac sarcomas, many of whom have distant metastases when first seen.W3 For patients with angiosarcoma who had medical therapy but not surgical resection, Neragi-Miandoab and colleagues reported that 90% were dead within 12 months.N6

# TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

The tumor is removed as completely as possible. Radical excision of portions of the atria and ventricles may be necessary. For tumors involving the right heart, resection may include the superior vena cava, entire right atrium, tricuspid valve, right coronary artery, and up to about 30% of the right ventricular muscle mass.V5 For sarcomas of the left heart, autotransplantation has been recommended to permit radical tumor resection and adequate reconstruction.B17,C16,V5 Under a clinical trial (ESPERO) at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and Methodist DeBakey Heart and Vascular Center in Houston, Texas, all patients with cardiac sarcomas and no overt heart failure are given neoadjuvant chemotherapy preoperatively to reduce tumor bulk and destroy tumor cells at the periphery of the tumor.V5

#### SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Usual postoperative care is given (see Chapter 5).

#### RESULTS

Among a series of 27 patients with cardiac sarcoma treated surgically by the Houston group, operative mortality was 7.4% (2 patients).B2 Chemotherapy was administered to 19. At a median follow-up of 22 months, 12 patients were alive and 7 were tumor free. Among 24 patients who underwent operation with curative intent, median survival was 24 months. Patients who underwent surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation, or radiation treatment for tumor recurrence (*n* = 7) had a median survival of 47 months. Patients (*n* = 7) with no further intervention for recurrent disease had a median survival of 25 months.

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Because many patients with cardiac sarcomas have evidence of metastatic disease on presentation, and because persistent tumor is often present at the limits of the surgical resection, indications for radical surgical treatment are not clearly defined. Surgical treatment combined with chemotherapy should be considered for younger patients without clear evidence for metastatic disease.

# **Section IX Carcinoid Heart Disease**

#### DEFINITION

Carcinoid heart disease is a manifestation of malignant carcinoid syndrome in which a unique form of fibrosis involves the endocardium, primarily of the right heart. *Malignant carcinoid syndrome* is a symptom complex associated with carcinoid tumors of the gastrointestinal tract arising from argentaffin cells, which secrete large amounts of serotonin. Primary tumors are usually in the ileum, but may occur in the pancreas, biliary vessels, ovaries, and testes. The syndrome is characterized by flushing, telangiectasias, diarrhea, and bronchospasm and occurs in about 10% of patients with carcinoid tumors. Carcinoid heart disease occurs in approximately 50% of those who have the syndrome.M24

#### MORPHOLOGY

Most patients with carcinoid heart disease have pathologic lesions limited to right-sided valves. These are glistening, white-yellow fibrous deposits, devoid of elastic fibers, located on the ventricular aspect of the tricuspid valve and downstream aspect of the pulmonary valve.R9,R13 The fibrous plaques result in constriction of the valve anulus and adherence of the valve leaflets to the right ventricular endocardium, in the case of tricuspid involvement, and the pulmonary trunk wall, in the case of pulmonary valve involvement. Thus, the dominant physiology is that of tricuspid regurgitation or pulmonary stenosis. The valve lesions morphologically resemble those resulting from appetite suppressants (fenfluramine and phentermine), because the lesions are not neoplasms and, in the case of carcinoid heart disease, not metastatic tumors.B14 In virtually all patients with carcinoid valve lesions, there are hepatic metastases from the primary gut tumor. (See "Carcinoid Tricuspid Valve Disease" under Morphology in Chapter 14 for a more detailed discussion.)

### CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

Patients have the classic cutaneous flushing of carcinoid syndrome and usually display a hyperdynamic circulation, although they are generally not hypertensive. Nearly all have a systolic murmur and may also have cardiomegaly. In 74 patients investigated by Pellikka and colleagues, all had tricuspid valve involvement, and 90% had moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation.P6 By echocardiography, the valve leaflets are shortened and thickened and on color Doppler have a characteristic "dagger-shaped" spectral profile. Patients with carcinoid heart disease have greater serum levels of serotonin and tachykinins than patients with the syndrome but without cardiac involvement. Severity of cardiac involvement, in addition, tends to correlate with both serum serotonin levels and higher urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA).R11

# NATURAL HISTORY

Survival in patients with carcinoid heart disease is lower than in patients with the syndrome but without cardiac involvement. Evolution of valve lesions may be rapid, leading to heart failure, although death is usually caused by progressive systemic disease.M24

#### TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

Tricuspid valve replacement may provide palliation in some patients (see "Technique of Operation" in Chapter 14). Pulmonary valve replacement may also be beneficial in reducing right ventricular dysfunction.B10,C17 There are at least two reports of secondary fibrous carcinoid involvement of tissue valves used to replace tricuspid or pulmonary valves in patients with carcinoid syndrome.O5,S4 Balloon valvotomy may be palliative, but is likely to be followed by early recurrence of stenosis.

## SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Usual cardiac postoperative care is given (see Chapter 5); additionally, levels of urinary 5-HIAA are monitored.

#### RESULTS

Robiolio and colleagues reviewed 47 carcinoid valve replacement cases. Thirty-day mortality was 56% for patients older than 60 years and 0% for those 60 years or younger. Two patients survived beyond a decade.R10

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Precise indications for valve replacement cannot be stated. The underlying disease is progressive, and operative mortality for valve replacement mortality is high in older patients. Therefore, a young individual with low comorbidity and important heart failure would likely present the best candidate for a satisfactory outcome.
