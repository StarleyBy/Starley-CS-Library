## DEFINITION

Atrioventricular (AV) septal defects are characterized by a deficiency or absence of septal tissue immediately above and below the normal level of the AV valves, including the region normally occupied by the AV septum, in hearts with two ventricles. The AV valves are abnormal to a varying degree.

These defects have also been called *AV canal defects, AV defects, endocardial cushion defects, ostium primum atrial septal defects* (when there is no interventricular communication), and *common AV orifice* (when there is only a single AV valve orifice).B8

## HISTORICAL NOTE

## Morphology

Abbott apparently recognized ostium primum atrial septal defect (ASD) and common AV canal defect, but it was Rogers and Edwards who in 1948 recognized their morphologic similarity.A1,R10 This concept was further elaborated by Wakai and Edwards in 1956 and 1958.W1,W2 The terms *partial* and *complete atrioventricular canal defects* were introduced by these investigators, who realized nonetheless that not all cases fit their definitions. During this period, Lev was formulating his concepts of ostium primum ASD (or partial AV canal) and common AV orifice (or complete AV canal), and he described the position of the AV node and bundle of His in these malformations.L5 Wakai and Edwards and later Bharati and Lev became dissatisfied with trying to compress all cases into two categories and added the terms *intermediate* and *transitional*. B14,W1,W2 During this period, Van Mierop's scholarly studies added a great deal of knowledge about the overall anatomic features of AV septal defects.V4

By the early 1960s, surgical treatment of these defects provided a stimulus to further morphologic studies. In 1966, Rastelli and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic described in more detail the morphology of AV valve leaflets in cases with common AV orifice.R1 The error made in this study was to compress into the designation *common anterior leaflet* a leaflet that was in fact divided in two by a commissure (i.e., the divided common anterior leaflet of type A). The description of AV valve leaflets by Rastelli and colleagues was accepted for some years, but in 1976 a publication by Ugarte and colleagues emphasized the idea of leaflets *bridging* the ventricular septum, a concept also held by Lev.U1 Meanwhile, based on anatomic and cineangiographic studies and in accordance with the description of Baron and colleagues and Van Mierop and colleagues, it was recognized in the late 1960s that the basic defect in these malformations was *absence of the AV septum*. B4,B20,V4 This concept is particularly important because the AV septum can be imaged by echocardiography and in the left ventriculogram in the right anterior oblique projection. These concepts were further expanded by Piccoli and colleagues under the direction of Anderson, who further emphasized that all the variations of the defect were part of a spectrumP6,P8 (Fig. 34-1).

# Surgical Treatment

In 1952 at the University of Minnesota Hospital in Minneapolis, after a long period of laboratory investigation, Dennis and Varco attempted for the first time a cardiac operation in a human using a pump-oxygenator. The preoperative diagnosis was ASD, and at operation the defect was thought to be closed. The patient died, and autopsy showed the true diagnosis to be partial AV septal defect (Edwards JE: personal communication, 1980). The first successful repair of a complete AV septal defect was performed by Lillehei and colleagues in 1954, using cross-circulation and direct suture of the atrial rim of the septal defect to the crest of the ventricular septum.L10 In 1954, Kirklin and colleagues successfully repaired a partial AV septal defect through the atrial well of Watkins and Gross, and in 1955 began repairing AV septal defects by open cardiotomy and use of the pump-oxygenator.K12,K13,R6,W3

Early experiences with complete AV septal defects were all associated with a high hospital mortality, often related to complete heart block, postrepair left AV valve regurgitation, or creation of subaortic stenosis.C12,E7,L7,S3 Interestingly, in many of these early operations, a two-patch technique was used (see "Two-Patch Technique" under Technique of Operation later in this chapter). In 1958, Lev's description of the location of the bundle of His provided the basis for repair techniques that avoid heart block.L5 In 1959, Dubost and Blondeau reported their early experience and emphasized that the "cleft" in the "mitral leaflet" need not be sutured in repairing partial AV septal defects, a concept currently challenged.D8 In 1962, Maloney and colleagues described two cases in which a single patch was used to close both

LIL usually bridges a little (grade 1 or 2, based on 1 to 5) across crest of ventricular septum. LSL may bridge slightly or not at all (grade 0 or 1, Rastelli type A), moderately (grade 2 or 3, Rastelli type B), or markedly (grade 4 or 5, Rastelli type C).

defects and with the valve tissue suspended from the patch. M5 This technique was again described by Gerbode in 1962 and was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality. R3 McGoon recognized the importance of "taking from the tricuspid valve" to leave sufficient tissue from which to create an adequate left AV valve. These technical advances allowed repair of even the more complex variants of the defect. P1,R4 Subsequently, good results were obtained in patients older than about 2 years of age, but results in infants remained relatively poor. B1,B9,G1,H2,K3,M9,M12,R3,V2 Between 1968 and 1971, Barratt-Boyes successfully repaired this anomaly in four severely ill infants B5; subsequently, improved results in infants were reported by many others. A5,B1,B12,C13,C17,M3,M11,N1

In 1978, Carpentier again emphasized (as did Dubost and Blondeau<sup>D8</sup>) that generally, the left AV valve functions best when repaired as a three-leaflet valve.<sup>C2</sup> As a result of these advances, risks of operation for nearly all types of AV septal defect are now low.<sup>C6,S15</sup>

## **MORPHOLOGY**

#### General Morphologic Characteristics

AV septal defects have as defining characteristics a deficiency or absence of the AV septum, resulting in an ostium primum defect immediately above the AV valves and a deficiency (or scooped-out area) in the inlet (basal) portion of the ventricular septum immediately below the AV valves.

Patients with partial AV septal defects have a normal length of atrial septum, and the ostium primum ASD is the result of absence of the relatively small AV septum plus some deficiency in the inlet portion of the ventricular septum. The deficiency in the inlet portion of the ventricular septum is variable, but on average is greater in patients with complete AV septal defects than in those with partial defects. The septime of the ventricular septum is variable, but on average is greater in patients with complete and the septime of the ventricular septum is variable, but on average is greater in patients with complete and the ventricular septum is variable, but on average is greater in patients with complete and the ventricular septum is variable.

These septal deficiencies may or may not result in interatrial or interventricular communications, depending on configuration and attachments of the AV valves (Tables 34-1 and 34-2). Whereas the basic defect in these malformations is absence of the AV septum, whether the ventricular septal or atrial septal deficiency or the AV valve abnormality is the result only of AV septal absence is still debated. B4,B20,V4

Five or more AV valve leaflets of variable size are usually present (see Fig. 34-1), but there is often variability in completeness of commissures and prominent crenations in the leaflets (Fig. 34-2). For example, among the 43 hearts with all types of AV septal defects and 2 ventricles in the GLH autopsy series in which the number of leaflets could be accurately assessed, 10 (23%) had 4 leaflets, 18 (42%) had 5 leaflets, 14 (33%) had 6 leaflets, and 1 (2%) had 7 leaflets. When a large interventricular communication was present (complete AV septal defect), the most common number of leaflets was 5 (16 of 28, or 57%).

*b* Condition in which the characteristic atrioventricular (AV) septal deficiency is present, but the AV valves are adherent on their ventricular side to the crest of the ventricular septum, resulting in no interventricular communication (if this occurs under both left AV valve leaflets, it is commonly called *partial AV septal defect*. If size greater than 1 occurs under both AV valve leaflets, the condition is commonly called *complete AV septal defect*).

The left superior leaflet (LSL) and left inferior leaflet (LIL) are particularly variable in size, connections one to another (Table 34-3), and degree of bridging across the crest of the ventricular septum (Table 34-4; see Figs. 34-1 and 34-2). There may be one or two AV valve orifices (Table 34-5).

Hearts with AV septal defects are also characterized by absence of the usual wedged position of the aortic valve above the AV valves. Instead, it is elevated and deviated anteriorly.P6,V3,V4 Details of the aortic-mitral fibrous continuity often differ from those in the normal heart. Thus, continuity was abnormal in more than half of 21 specimens with normally related great arteries in the GLH autopsy series; continuity was to the base of the noncoronary cusp in only 5 (24%) and to both the noncoronary and right coronary cusps in 7 (33%). In addition, the left ventricular (LV) inflow tract is shortened in relationship to length of the outflow portion, and there is a related reduction in length of the diaphragmatic wall of the LV.G3,P6,V3,V4 The LV outflow

AV septal defects include a spectrum of malformations. At one end is the simplest type, in which there is an interatrial communication but no interventricular communication and a connection of variable width between the LSL and LIL; this is called a *partial AV septal defect* or *ostium primum defect*. At the other end of the spectrum is the most extreme form, with large deficiencies in atrial and ventricular septa, a common AV valve orifice, and large interatrial and interventricular communications; this is called a *complete AV septal defect*. Because a continuous spectrum of gradations lies between these extremes, some anomalies have been grouped

Very large communication but not common ventricle.

Arrow marks line of closure between LS and LI leaflets, formerly called the "cleft in the anterior mitral leaflet." Note that as usual, LS leaflet does not bridge septum (there is no leaflet tissue in the position of the superior portion of the normal tricuspid septal leaflet). In this heart, as is not uncommon, there are two left lateral and two right lateral leaflets. **B,** Specimen with complete AV septal defect in which there are interventricular communications beneath LS and LI leaflets. LS leaflet does not bridge crest of septum. Right superior *(RS)* leaflet is characteristically large. LI leaflet is bridging (grade 2) and very distinct from right inferior *(RI)* leaflet. **C,** Specimen of a complete AV septal defect in which LS leaflet markedly bridges crest of septum. Correspondingly, RS leaflet is small. LS leaflet is characteristically larger than LI leaflet. Key: *LA,* Left atrium; *RA,* right atrium.

as *intermediate* or *transitional AV septal defects*. Definitions of these intermediate types have varied but usually include presence of two AV valve orifices and a restrictive inlet ventricular septal defect (VSD), with dense chordal attachments to the ventricular septum (see "Unusual Atrioventricular Combinations" under Morphology).M13 Added complexity is provided by occurrence of a large variety of major and minor associated cardiac anomalies (Tables 34-6 and 34-7). In addition, Down syndrome is common, particularly in patients with an interventricular communication.

Because it is virtually impossible to subdivide the spectrum of AV septal defects into satisfactory noncontroversial subgroups, this chapter describes cases based on morphologic and functional variables rather than categorizing them into subgroups.S15 The older imprecise terms continue to be useful as shorthand, and in this chapter, *partial AV septal defect*

#### Atrial Septal Deficiency and Interatrial Communications

## *Partial Atrioventricular Septal Defect*

Usually there is an interatrial communication related to *deficiency of the AV septum,* the so-called *ostium primum ASD* (Fig. 34-3). The defect is bounded below by the inferiorly displaced AV valve leaflets and above by a crescentic ridge of atrial septum that fuses with the AV valve anulus only at its extremities.

Generally, there is little atrial septal tissue at the superior point of fusion of the atrial septum with the valve anulus adjacent to the aorta, but more tissue is usually present inferiorly adjacent to the coronary sinus (Fig. 34-4). The distance between the crescentic atrial margin of the defect and the AV valves (and thus the size of the interatrial communication) is variable. In most cases, the fossa ovalis is normally formed and there is a patent foramen ovale or an associated fossa ovalis ASD. Usually the interatrial communication through the ostium primum defect is moderate in size. When the interatrial communication is small, the atrial septal deficiency is restricted to the area normally occupied by the AV septum.V12 The communication may be still smaller due to fusion of the base of the LSL or LIL to the edge of the adjacent portion of the atrial septum. Rarely, there may be an accessory "parachute" of fibrous tissue that narrows or obstructs the defect. Under such circumstances, a pressure difference exists between the two atria.

#### *Common Atrium*

Deficiencies in the anterior limbus or fossa ovalis may be associated with AV septal defects, resulting in a larger interatrial communication. Occasionally the entire limbus and fossa ovalis are absent, along with the AV septum. The condition is then termed *common atrium*E6,G2,R2,R5 (see Table 34-1).

## *Absence of Interatrial Communication*

Rarely, AV valve tissue is attached completely to the edge of the atrial septum, and no interatrial communication exists despite the deficiency in the septumP6,S15 (see Table 34-1). In this unusual variant, the characteristic deficiency of the inlet (basal) portion of the ventricular septum is also present and associated with a large interventricular communication beneath the leaflets. The functionally left AV valve, consisting only of those portions of the LSL and LIL on the *left side* of their attachment to the atrial septum, tends to be competent. As seen from a right atrial approach, part of the right AV valve may have chordal attachments across the ventricular defect to the left side of the septum—that is, it is straddling. When viewed from the ventricular side, the appearance is typical of a complete AV septal defect. It is distinct from an inlet type of perimembranous VSD that is sometimes called *inlet septal, AV septal,* or *AV canal type of VSD,* which is unrelated to deficiency of the AV septum (see "Inlet Septal Ventricular Septal Defect" under Morphology in Chapter 35

and "Inlet Septal Type of Ventricular Septal Defect" in text that follows).

# Ventricular Septal Deficiency and Interventricular Communications

## *Partial Atrioventricular Septal Defect*

Some degree of deficiency of the inlet portion of the ventricular septum immediately beneath the AV valves is a constant finding. Thus, the inlet portion of the ventricular septum is shortened. There is usually no interventricular communication when the LSL and LIL are connected and attached to the downwardly displaced crest of the septum throughout its length (Fig. 34-5; see also Fig. 34-3), the situation described as a *partial AV septal defect*. Occasionally, one or several small interventricular communications are present beneath the attachment of the AV valve to the septum (Fig. 34-5, *B*).

#### *Complete Atrioventricular Septal Defect*

With ventricular septal deficiency generally greater than that in a partial AV septal defect, a moderate or large interventricular communication may be present, and usually the LSL and LIL are separate. This anomaly is described as a *complete AV septal defect* (Fig. 34-5, *C*). Deficiency of the inlet portion of the ventricular septum (the "scoop") is generally deeper in hearts with complete AV septal defects than in those with partial AV septal defects.A10,E1,F2 Often the communication is particularly large beneath the LSL and smaller beneath the LIL (see Table 34-2), whereas in about 5% of cases there is a larger interventricular communication beneath the LSL and none beneath the LIL. Rarely, there is no VSD beneath the LSL and a large one beneath the LIL.

A remnant of the membranous ventricular septum may be present (see Fig. 34-5, *B*). This was the case in 8 of 27 (30%) GLH autopsy specimens of AV septal defect with normally related great arteries; in 19 specimens the membranous septum could not be identified.

#### Atrioventricular Valves

Attachments of the AV valves to the crest of the ventricular septum in partial AV septal defects, as well as their chordal attachments in complete AV septal defects, are displaced toward the apex of the heart because of deficiency of the inlet (basal) portion of the septum. This alters orientation of the AV orifices relative to the aortic orifice (i.e., the aortic valve is no longer wedged between the AV valves) and provides an important diagnostic imaging criterion of this malformation.A9,B3,B20

## *Two Atrioventricular Valve Orifices*

Typically when two AV valve orifices are present, as in partial AV septal defects, the LSL and LIL are joined together to a variable extent anteriorly by leaflet tissue near the crest of the ventricular septum (see Figs. 34-1 and 34-3). Together they resemble an anterior (septal) mitral leaflet with a cleft, but in fact the left AV valve is tricuspid and oriented differently from the normal valve (see Figs. 34-1 and 34-2). The connection between the LSL and LIL may be only a thin strand of tissue (complete cleft), but more commonly it is 2 to 4 mm or more deep (see Table 34-3). This connection, too, is usually fused to the crest of the ventricular septum in partial AV septal defects. Occasionally, chordae pass from opposing edges of the LSL and LIL to the muscular ventricular septum beneath.E5 Yilmaz and colleagues identify a difference in this area of separation and distinguish between a commissure supported by chordal apparatus on either side of the gap and a cleft that is relatively unsupported and bereft of chordae at its edges.Y2 In addition, the chordae that originate from the central edges of the LSL and LIL attach to different papillary muscles, which can cause a distracting force on the leaflets during closure. This contrasts with the normal commissure in which the chordae from adjacent leaflet edges attach to a single papillary muscle, encouraging coaptation. Rarely, separation into LSL and LIL is represented only by a notch in the center of the free edge of a nearly normal "anterior mitral leaflet." The left lateral leaflet (LLL) is usually smaller than the other two leaflets and is triangular.

In aggregate, these left AV valve leaflet anomalies may make the valve regurgitant to a variable degree, sometimes severely (Table 34-8). When LSL and LIL are nearly completely separated (connection grades 1 and 2; see Table 34-3), an appreciable gap may occur during systole, producing regurgitation. When there is failure of valve coaptation at this site, leaflet tissue forming the margin usually becomes thickened and rolled. In other cases, regurgitation appears to be due to deficiency of leaflet tissue, particularly in the LIL.B16,M10 The mechanism of severe left AV valve regurgitation is, however, not evident in some cases. The jet of regurgitation is usually directed into the right atrium. Rarely, the left AV valve is stenotic, but this usually is associated with hypoplasia of the LV.B18

Data from Studer and colleagues. S15 aNo information on five patients.

The right AV valve is also abnormal when there are two AV orifices, although less attention has been paid to it. It may consist of three leaflets—right superior leaflet (RSL), right lateral leaflet (RLL), and right inferior leaflet (RIL)—or of two or four leaflets (see Figs. 34-1 and 34-2). Leaflet tissue attached directly or by chordae to the crest or right side of the crest of the septum, and thus contributing to closure of the right AV valves, is considered to represent bridging of the LSL or LIL (see Fig. 34-1).

Usually in cases without an interventricular communication, the LSL does not bridge at all (previously, this finding was interpreted as absence or hypoplasia of the superior part of the tricuspid septal leaflet) and the LIL bridges moderately (see Fig. 34-2, A). Even with abnormalities of the right AV valve, regurgitation is rare (unless right heart failure develops).

#### Common Atrioventricular Orifice

When the AV valve orifice is a common one and the interventricular communication is large (complete AV septal defect), the LSL and LIL are separate, and a bare area is exposed on the crest of the ventricular septum (Fig. 34-6; see Figs. 34-1 and 34-5, C). The LSL may be entirely on the LV side of the septum or may, to a variable degree, bridge the septum and extend onto the right ventricular side (see Fig. 34-2, B-C and Table 34-4). This variability formed the basis for the classification by Rastelli and colleagues into types A, B, and C.<sup>R1</sup> Chordal attachments of the right ventricular extremity of the LSL vary according to degree of bridging<sup>P8</sup> (Fig. 34-7). When there is no bridging, chordal attachments are to the ventricular crest (Fig. 34-7, A). With mild bridging, they are to the medial papillary muscle in the right ventricle; with moderate bridging, to an accessory (often large) apical papillary muscle (Fig. 34-7, B); and with marked bridging, to the normally positioned (although often bifid) anterolateral papillary muscle of the right ventricle (Fig. 34-7, C). When the LSL bridges the septum moderately or markedly and extends into the right ventricle, it is usually unattached to the underlying ventricular crest (free-floating), but it may occasionally be attached by chordae (tethered). Length of the chordal or fibrous attachments to the right side or crest of the ventricular septum varies according to size of the interventricular communication or the position of the leaflet.

**Figure 34-6** Complete atrioventricular septal defect viewed from right ventricular side in a specimen in which left inferior leaflet bridges over crest of septum onto right ventricular side. Left superior leaflet (poorly seen) does not bridge, resulting in a bare area of crest of ventricular septum on right ventricular side, where in a normal heart, superior aspect of septal leaflet touches septum. A small fossa ovalis atrial septal defect is also present. Key: *CoS*, Coronary sinus; *LI*, left inferior leaflet.

The LIL typically bridges moderately, but it too varies in this respect. It is not uncommon for a bridging LIL to be attached to the underlying ventricular crest either completely or by short, thick chordae with interchordal spaces.

Chordal attachments of the leftward components of the common AV valve in the LV are usually relatively normal, although the posterior papillary muscle is displaced more laterally than normal and a third papillary muscle may be present. C2 There may be only one papillary muscle, producing a parachute-type valve that is difficult to repair. C2 This was true in 7 of 53 (13%) cases in the GLH autopsy series, in 14% of the specimens described by David and colleagues, and in 4% of 155 surgical cases reported by Ilbawi and colleagues. D2,II

This surgical specimen (the patch having been removed) is viewed from right atrium. Arrow marks mildly bridging left inferior (LI) leaflet. **B,** Moderate (grade 2 or 3) bridging of LS leaflet. Chordae from its right ventricular extremity go to a papillary muscle in right ventricle. Arrow indicates bridging portion of LI leaflet. (Rastelli and colleagues termed this *type B*, but it is just part of the spectrum of bridging.) **C,** Marked (grade 5) bridging of LS leaflet (Rastelli type C). Arrow marks bridging part of LI leaflet. Key: *RS,* Right superior leaflet; *S,* ventricular septal crest. (From Rastelli and colleagues.R1)

The right ventricular portion of the common AV valve has superior, lateral, and inferior leaflets, but as in partial AV septal defects, they vary considerably in number and size (see Fig. 34-2). When bridging of the LSL is absent or mild, the RSL is large, whereas with more extensive bridging, it is smaller.P8

When leaflets of the common AV valve close appropriately during ventricular systole, AV valve regurgitation is absent or mild. However, important left AV valve regurgitation may be present (see Table 34-8). The mechanism of the regurgitation is often not clearly understood.

Anatomic studies by Kanani and colleagues have emphasized the marked valvar abnormalities in this malformation, not only of the anular component but also of the subvalvar apparatus (with deficiency of chordal arrangement) and leaflet tissue (which is often deficient in coaptation surface and pliability following repair).K5

**Figure 34-8** Intermediate type of atrioventricular (AV) septal defect viewed from left ventricular aspect. Left superior *(LS)* leaflet is connected to left inferior *(LI)* leaflet by leaflet tissue, resulting in two AV valve orifices; yet there are interventricular communications between short, thick chordae connecting leaflets and their connection to scooped-out underlying ventricular septum. LS and LI leaflets, particularly the latter, are deficient. (From Bharati and colleagues.B16)

# *Unusual Atrioventricular Combinations*

Other unusual combinations of size, connections, attachments, and degree of bridging of AV valve leaflets in the spectrum of AV septal defects prompted Wakai and Edwards, Bharati and colleagues, and others to use a *transitional* or *intermediate category*. B16,W1,W7 Rarely in patients with two AV valve orifices with no interventricular communication beneath the LSL and LIL, these leaflets are connected only by a fibrous strand adherent to the ventricular septal crest (see Tables 34-3 and 34-5), forming what Bharati and colleagues have called a "pseudomitral leaflet," rather than an "anterior mitral leaflet with a complete cleft."B16

In such patients, deficiency of LIL tissue and severe left AV valve regurgitation are common. Occasionally when the LSL and LIL are connected (and thus two AV valve orifices are present), one or multiple small interchordal interventricular communications are present beneath the leaflets (see Tables 34-2 and 34-5), and occasionally one or two larger holes may be present (Fig. 34-8; see Fig. 34-5, *B*). In about 1% of cases, the connected LSL and LIL have large interventricular communications beneath them; in these patients, the connection is a thin strand of valve tissue beneath which there is also a large interventricular communication (Fig. 34-9), but two AV valve orifices can be said to be present (see Table 34-5). Bharati and colleagues have referred to this as *intermediate type C*. B16

**Figure 34-9** Intermediate type of atrioventricular septal defect viewed from left ventricular aspect. Left superior *(LS)* and left inferior *(LI)* leaflets are connected by leaflet tissue, and thus two AV valve orifices are present. However, the interventricular communication is large, and neither connection nor leaflets are attached to scoopedout underlying ventricular septum. (From Bharati and colleagues.B16)

#### *Accessory Orifice*

An accessory orifice (double left AV valve orifice) is present in the commissure on one side, usually the inferior side, of the LLL in about 5% of casesI1,L4,M10,W2 (Table 34-9). A ring of chordae surrounds the orifice, and a very small papillary muscle is usually beneath it.B2,E2 The accessory orifice may be conceptualized as an incomplete commissure, and the fibrous tissue "bridge" between the accessory orifice and main orifice

consists of valvar tissue and chordae.B2 This emphasizes the danger of producing regurgitation by cutting the bridge. The LLL is often underdeveloped when an accessory orifice is present.D7 Accessory orifices predispose patients to stenosis after repair.

#### *Single Papillary Muscle*

A single papillary muscle in the LV uncommonly (about 5% of cases) complicates AV septal defects, most commonly the complete type.D2,T2 All chordae of the left AV valve leaflets insert into this single papillary muscle, which is usually situated anteriorly in the LV. In complete AV septal defect with a free-floating and bridging LSL, no LV inflow obstruction results. Otherwise, or after repair, the situation is entirely analogous to a true "parachute mitral valve" (see "Papillary Muscle Anomalies" under Morphology in Chapter 50), and inflow obstruction can complicate intracardiac repair.D2,D7,I1,T2

# Ventricles

The LV outflow tract is characteristically elongated and narrowed (Fig. 34-10) in all types of AV septal defect (see "General Morphologic Characteristics" under Morphology earlier in this chapter).

In AV septal defect with large interventricular communications, the LV may be abnormally large, but its size is variable, both absolutely and in relation to the right ventricle.B14,C10,J1,S19 In the severely right-dominant type of AV septal defect, the LV is severely hypoplasticS15 (Fig. 34-11). In such cases, the atrial septum may be displaced leftward in relation to the plane of the ventricular septum, in

Arrow indicates superior margin of the ostium primum atrial septal defect. Key: *CoS,* Coronary sinus.

which case it overrides the left AV valve to a varying degree and may be associated with hypoplasia of the left atrium.T4,U1 This variant is therefore sometimes included in "hypoplastic left heart physiology" (see Chapter 49).

The right ventricle has no specific anomalies, but is usually enlarged secondary to the left-to-right shunt. Its size is also variable, and occasionally it is importantly hypoplastic.

The LV or right ventricle is severely hypoplastic in about 7% of patients born with complete AV septal defect.C8 Prevalence of the two types is similar. Presence of severe ventricular hypoplasia can increase risk of surgical correction and may demand a Fontan-type repair, alone or with a technique for correcting the hypoplastic left heart physiologyC8,J1,S15 (see Special Situations and Controversies later in this chapter and Chapter 41).

#### Septal Malalignment

Usually the two AV valves or common AV valve orifice lies in proper proportion over the two ventricles. When one ventricle is hypoplastic, the ventricular septum is malaligned and lies more to the side of the hypoplastic ventricle (see Fig. 34-11).

Less commonly, the atrial septal remnant is malaligned, and then usually leftward. When this is severe, both AV valves (or common AV valve orifice) are accessible only from the right atrium, and blood exists from the left atrium only through the ostium primum defect (so-called double outlet right atrium).A6,C15,W5

## Left Ventricular Outflow or Inflow Obstruction

Important LV outflow tract obstruction occurs rarely in unoperated hearts (about 1% of cases) in all types of AV septal defect.C8,P7,S3,S15,T4 It more often becomes apparent as a postoperative complication. It is surprising that it is not more frequent, in view of the elongation and narrowing of this area in affected hearts.D6,E4

Part of the elongation and narrowing is due to the more extensive area of direct fibrous continuity between the aortic valve and the LSL than is present normally between the aortic and mitral valves.E3 This is caused in part by the short, thick chordae that often anchor the LSL to the crest of the ventricular septum.C5,V6 Also, the anterolateral muscle bundle of the LV (muscle of Moulaert) bulges more into the LV outflow tract in hearts with AV septal defects than in normal hearts, contributing to the tendency to outflow obstruction after repair.D6 In addition to these basic arrangements tending to narrow the LV outflow tract, LV obstruction may be contributed to by morphologically discrete subaortic stenosis or by excrescences of AV valve tissue heaped up in the LV outflow tract.B10,P7,S11,T3 It may also result from abnormally positioned papillary muscles.P7 Occasionally, its presence is overlooked preoperatively, and it becomes apparent or develops only after operation.

Important LV inflow obstruction may occur rarely.P7 This may be from simple narrowing of the AV valve entrance into the LV, usually associated with marked right ventricular dominance. It may be related to presence of an accessory AV valve orifice on the left side, or it may result from cor triatriatum (see Chapter 32) or a supravalvar fibrous ring.T6 These associated cardiac anomalies appear to be more prevalent in patients without Down syndrome.D3,V5

## Conduction System

The defect in the AV septum often displaces the coronary sinus ostium inferiorly, which may appear to lie in the left atrium, especially when the ostium primum atrial defect is particularly large. The AV node is also displaced inferiorly (caudally) and lies in the posterior right atrial wall between the orifice of the coronary sinus and ventricular crestL5 (Fig. 34-12) in what has been termed the *nodal triangle*. T5 The bundle of His passes forward and superiorly from the node to the ventricular crest, reaching it where the crest fuses posteriorly with the AV valve anulus.B15 It then courses along the top of the ventricular septum beneath the bridging portion of the LIL, giving off the left bundle branches. As it reaches the midpoint of the crest of the ventricular septum, it becomes the right bundle branch, which continues along the crest a little farther before it descends toward the muscle of Lancisi and moderator band. These anatomic findings have been supported by electrophysiologic studies at operation.K4,K17 This morphology of the conduction system is a determinant of the electrocardiographic pattern usually seen in AV septal defects.F1,T5

# Major Associated Cardiac Anomalies

Table 34-6 presents the prevalence of the major cardiac anomalies associated with AV septal defects.

## *Patent Ductus Arteriosus*

A patent ductus arteriosus is present in about 10% of patients with AV septal defects. It is particularly common in those with an interventricular communication.

Typical tetralogy of Fallot is present in about 5% of patients with complete AV septal defects, and about 1% of patients with tetralogy of Fallot have associated complete AV septal defects.B13,K11,N1 The LSL bridges markedly and is free-floating over the crest of the ventricular septum, and the interventricular communication beneath it is large and juxtaaortic.D1,L6 An interventricular communication beneath the LIL is present in only about half of cases.V9 Rarely the LSL and LIL are connected by a fibrous (or valvar) band, beneath which also is a large interventricular communication. The right ventricular outflow tract has typical tetralogy morphology (see Chapter 38) that may be so severe that pulmonary atresia is present. Localized narrowing occasionally occurring in that portion of the LV outflow tract just upstream from the recess formed by the subaortic deficiency of the ventricular septum further complicates the situation in rare cases.

# *Double Outlet Right Ventricle*

Double outlet right ventricle (DORV) without pulmonary stenosis complicates complete AV septal defect in about 2% of cases.B6,B13,R1,S12,S15 As in tetralogy of Fallot, usually

deficiency of the ventricular septum is large and juxtaaortic beneath the extensively bridging and free-floating LSL. However, occasionally the interventricular communication is far from the aortic and pulmonary valves and is "noncommitted."B6 Rarely, Taussig-Bing type of DORV is present.B13,S12 DORV combined with severe pulmonary stenosis coexists with complete AV septal defects in about 1% of cases.S15 These combinations of DORV and AV septal defect with large interventricular communication frequently also have atrial isomerism or situs inversus, common atrium, completely unroofed coronary sinus with left superior vena cava, azygos extension of the inferior vena cava, or total anomalous pulmonary venous connection.P2,S12

# *Transposition of the Great Arteries*

Very rarely, transposition of the great arteries (discordant ventriculoarterial connection) is associated.B13

# *Completely Unroofed Coronary Sinus with Left Superior Vena Cava*

Completely unroofed coronary sinus with persistent left superior vena cava (see Chapter 33) attached to left atrium occurs in about 3% of patients with an interventricular communication and in about 3% without, and is more frequent when common atrium is present.Q1 A partially unroofed distal end of the coronary sinus resulting in drainage of the coronary sinus into the left atrium occasionally occurs, but is a minor and unimportant associated anomaly.Y3 When complete AV septal defect is associated with persistent left superior vena cava and unroofed coronary sinus, atrial isomerism is also frequent (see Chapter 58).A4

## Minor Associated Cardiac Anomalies

Table 34-7 lists minor cardiac anomalies associated with AV septal defects.

# Pulmonary Vascular Disease

In partial AV septal defects, as in other types of ASDs, pulmonary vascular disease is uncommon, whereas in complete AV septal defects, as with large VSDs, pulmonary vascular disease usually appears early in life and progresses.H3

Morphologically, pulmonary vascular disease associated with complete AV septal defects is similar to that associated with large VSDs (see "Pulmonary Vascular Disease" under Morphology in Section I of Chapter 35). However, it tends to progress more rapidly in patients with complete AV septal defects. Correlation between histologic findings and pulmonary vascular resistance is similar in the two conditions.F3 The pulmonary vascular changes probably are more frequent and occur at an earlier age in patients with Down syndrome with complete AV septal defects compared with patients without Down syndrome.C9,Y1

# Down Syndrome

Down syndrome is rare in patients with partial AV septal defects but common (about 75%) in those with complete AV septal defects.W9 Left-sided obstructive lesions are 10 times less common in Down syndrome patientsD3,V5; other associated anomalies are probably also less common,P5 whereas advanced pulmonary vascular disease may be more frequent.F3

# Inlet Septal Type of Ventricular Septal Defect

It is important to note that an isolated inlet (AV septal) type of VSD (see Morphology in Section I of Chapter 35) occurs without any of the features of an AV septal defect as defined in this chapter, except that it involves the inflow portion of the ventricular septum beneath the septal tricuspid valve leaflet and usually also the area of the membranous ventricular septum. The AV septum, however, is intact, and the mitral and tricuspid anuli and aortic orifice lie in normal positions. This feature allows these VSDs to be readily differentiated echocardiographically and angiographically from AV septal defects. Interestingly, in isolated inlet VSD, the anterior mitral leaflet is occasionally cleft.

# CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

#### Pathophysiology

Left-to-right shunting is present in AV septal defects unless severe pulmonary vascular disease has developed or important right ventricular outflow tract obstruction or pulmonary valve stenosis coexists. When there is no interventricular communication, the shunt is at atrial level and usually large, but it may be small or moderate; in such cases, a pressure gradient can be demonstrated between left and right atria. When the shunt is large and left AV valve regurgitation is mild or absent, the hemodynamic state of the patient is identical to that in isolated ASD (see Clinical Features and Diagnostic Criteria in Chapter 30); only right ventricular stroke volume is increased. When important left AV valve regurgitation is present, the left-to-right shunt becomes much larger; in fact, the regurgitation jet usually goes directly from LV to right atrium. Left as well as right ventricular stroke volume is increased, and marked cardiomegaly and heart failure develop early in life.

When a large interventricular communication is also present (complete AV septal defect), the left-to-right shunt is large, and right ventricular and pulmonary artery pressures approach or equal systemic pressures (Table 34-10). Pulmonary vascular resistance rises rapidly and is usually importantly elevated after age 6 to 12 months and sometimes before.N2

Data from Studer and colleagues.S15 Data not available for 43 patients. Data not available for 23 patients. Key: *AO,* Aortic; *PA,* pulmonary artery. When present, AV valve regurgitation adds greatly to ventricular volume overload. For some reason, however, the overload usually seems to enlarge the right ventricle more than the left.

# *Atrioventricular Valve Regurgitation*

Prevalence of regurgitation at the left AV valve or common AV valve is considered to be less than before echocardiographic studies were available. Probably 10% to 15% of patients with partial AV septal defect have important regurgitation, not 40% as was estimated earlier (see Table 34-8). Moderate AV valve regurgitation is present in about 20% of infants with complete AV septal defects and severe regurgitation in only about 15%.A3,C6,W4 AV valve regurgitation may be considerably more common in older patients with complete AV septal defects.

A not-uncommon site of regurgitation is through the gap between the LSL and LIL, particularly near the leaflet hinge or base; partly for this reason, regurgitant flow frequently goes directly into the right atrium. Under such circumstances, the left atrium remains small and the right becomes large; but when the interatrial communication is smaller or the regurgitation is sited elsewhere, regurgitation may enter the left atrium, which enlarges.

Although the precise mechanism of AV valve regurgitation is often unclear, it apparently varies considerably, as would be expected from variations in the number, size, and configuration of the leaflets and their chordal attachments. In patients with partial AV septal defects and important left AV valve regurgitation, the LIL is commonly severely hypoplastic.

#### Symptoms and Physical Findings

Patients without an interventricular communication (partial AV septal defect) and with absent or mild left AV valve regurgitation often present in the first decade of life but may remain asymptomatic well beyond that age. Their clinical presentation is virtually identical to that of patients with the more common fossa ovalis ASD (see "Fossa Ovalis Defect" under Morphology in Chapter 30), except that they may have an apical systolic murmur when mild left AV valve regurgitation is present, and left axis deviation and a counterclockwise frontal plane loop.O1,T7

Moderate or severe (grade 3, 4, or 5) left AV valve regurgitation in patients with partial AV septal defects may produce symptoms earlier, and progressive severe heart failure may require treatment in infancy.B5 In addition to the usual signs of ASD, the heart is more active in association with a loud apical pansystolic murmur, and the apex of the LV may be palpable. Tachypnea and hepatomegaly are often evident.

In patients with complete AV septal defect, presentation is usually in the first year of life, frequently during the first months, as a result of progressive severe heart failure, which may not be controllable medically. There is associated tachypnea, poor peripheral perfusion, and failure to thrive. Occasionally, heart failure is minimal early in life, and presentation may be delayed until some years later, by which time there is almost always severe hypertensive pulmonary vascular disease and Eisenmenger complex (see "Clinical Findings" under Clinical Features and Diagnostic Criteria in Section I of Chapter 35). On physical examination, cardiomegaly with increased ventricular activity is apparent. The second heart sound at the base is split and usually fixed, with accentuation of the second component caused by elevated pulmonary artery pressure. A systolic murmur is audible over the left precordium from the shunt at ventricular level and is increased in intensity and nearer the apex when there is important AV valve regurgitation. A mid-diastolic flow murmur is characteristically widely heard both over the lower left precordium and at the apex secondary to the large diastolic flow across the malformed AV valve leaflets (depending on both the leftto-right shunt and any AV valve regurgitation).

In those patients with morphology intermediate between the partial and complete AV septal defects, clinical features depend on size of the interventricular communication and severity of left AV valve regurgitation.

## Chest Radiograph

In patients without an interventricular communication or important left AV valve regurgitation, the chest radiograph is the same as in other large ASDs. When moderate or severe left AV valve regurgitation is present, the radiograph usually shows marked cardiomegaly with evidence of LV, right ventricular, and right atrial enlargement and marked pulmonary plethora. Left atrial enlargement is not apparent unless the ostium primum defect is restrictive.

In complete AV septal defect, cardiomegaly and pulmonary plethora are evident in infants and young children presenting with heart failure. In patients who survive beyond this age, severely increased pulmonary vascular resistance usually dominates, and the heart is less enlarged, central pulmonary arteries are large, and lung fields are clear.

## Electrocardiogram

Electrocardiographic findings are rather specific.D9 They usually indicate marked right ventricular hypertrophy and may show LV hypertrophy as well. The PR interval is frequently prolonged. Of considerable diagnostic importance is the vectorcardiogram.T7 Ongley and colleagues conclude that a counterclockwise frontal plane loop anterior and to the right strongly suggests, but does not prove, the diagnosis.O1

## Two-Dimensional Echocardiogram

In AV septal defects without an interventricular communication or important left AV valve regurgitation, two-dimensional echocardiography, together with clinical presentation, chest radiograph, and electrocardiogram, is diagnostic, and cardiac catheterization with cineangiography is not necessary.L11,S8 Two-dimensional echocardiography, particularly with Doppler color flow imaging and, when possible, with a transthoracic window, can also provide full information for complete AV septal defects.C4,S7

The common AV orifice is easily seen in the four-chamber view (Fig. 34-13). Characteristically, left and right AV valves (separated or common) exist at the same level, in contrast to the cephalad displacement of the normal mitral valve. The elongated outflow septum and unwedged position of the aortic valve are also identifiable. Chordal attachment and degree of leaflet bridging can also be assessed. Finally, the degree of AV valve regurgitation is assessed with color flow.

Key: *Ao,* Aorta; *IVS,* interventricular septum; *LA,* left atrium; *LV,* left ventricle; *RA,* right atrium, *RV,* right ventricle; *V,* inlet ventricular septal defect; *1°,* primum; *2°,* secundum.

With subcostal views, the degree of balance in the commitment of the common AV orifice to right and left ventricles can be ascertained (see "Unbalanced Atrioventricular Septal Defects" under Special Situations and Controversies).

Limitations of echocardiography include lack of sensitivity for double orifice left AV valve and inability to assess quantitatively pulmonary vascular resistance and reactivity.

## Cardiac Catheterization and Cineangiogram

Direction and magnitude of shunting; pulmonary and systemic pressures, resistances, and flows; and right and left ventricular pressures can be measured and calculated from data obtained at cardiac catheterization (see "Cardiac Catheterization" under Clinical Features and Diagnostic Criteria in Section I of Chapter 35).P4 However, these studies are now required only when major cardiac anomalies coexist and when operability is questioned because of evidence of pulmonary vascular disease.

Angiocardiographic features of AV septal defects were well described by Baron and colleagues in 1964 and further refined by the work of Brandt and colleagues, Bargeron and colleagues, and Macartney and colleagues.B3,B4,B20,M1,S10 Both oblique and axial views are used.B3,B20 They demonstrate absence of the AV septum and deficiency of the inlet portion of the ventricular septum, elongation of the LV outflow tract in relationship to the inflow tract, elevation and anterior displacement of the aortic valve vis-à-vis the AV valves, and the anomalous relationship of anterior components of the left AV valve to the aorta. These are well portrayed by the line drawings of Baron and colleagues and representative cineangiogramsB4 (Figs. 34-14 through 34-16). The anomalous left AV valve's relationship to the aorta results in change in direction of left AV valve movement. Interatrial and interventricular shunting can also be demonstrated, as can presence of one or two AV valve orifices. With high-quality studies, leaflets of the left AV valve often can be visualized in motion to delineate the degree, location, and mechanism of valvar regurgitation.

The relative size of the two ventricles and of AV orifices must be determined by whatever technique echocardiography or angiography—is preferred. Severe hypoplasia of one or the other ventricle must be identified preoperatively, because such hypoplasia makes it less likely anatomic correction will be successful.C8,J1

#### Special Situations and Associated Defects

Presence of *common atrium* generally can be identified preoperatively by echocardiography or a cineangiogram, which show nearly complete absence of both atrial and AV septum (see Fig. 34-13). Finding mild arterial desaturation in a patient with clinical findings of an AV septal defect, but without an interventricular communication or pulmonary artery hypertension, suggests presence of common atrium.D9,M18,R2,R5 Presence of a left superior vena cava in such a setting suggests both unroofed coronary sinus syndrome and common atrium, because they frequently coexist.Q1,R5 In patients with common atrium and atrial isomerism, even more complex associations occur, including DORV, partial or total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, and azygos extension of the inferior vena cavaD7,K16,P2,S13,T1 (see Morphology in Chapter 58).

A patent ductus arteriosus can be identified on aortography. Likewise, associated malformations such as tetralogy of Fallot, DORV, transposition of the great arteries, and additional VSDs are identified by a combination of echocardiography and cineangiography.

It is essential to recognize functionally important *LV outflow tract obstruction*. Narrowing of this tract is inherent in AV septal defects but rarely results in a systolic pressure gradient. Distortion results from the shortened inflow axis of the LV and anterior displacement of the left AV valve complexV1 (Fig. 34-17). Thus, LV outflow obstruction is most prevalent in patients with Rastelli type A valve morphology.P7,S17 This distortion is rarely evident preoperatively as LV outflow obstruction. More frequently, important obstruction becomes evident postoperatively, both early and later. Usually it takes the form of subaortic discrete membranous stenosis, but the process may be relatively diffuse along the outflow tract. Infrequently, it occurs as a result of the ventricular patch component pulling the left AV valve apically and anteriorly such that the new "mitral" valve apparatus narrows the outflow tract. Thus, the initial AV septal repair must place the left AV valve at the appropriate level: caudad toward the apex may result in LV outflow tract obstruction; cephalad toward the atria may result in left AV valve regurgitation.

#### NATURAL HISTORY

The life history of patients with surgically untreated AV septal defects depends on morphologic and functional details of their malformation. When there is a *partial AV septal defect,*  only *mild left AV valve regurgitation,* and *no major associated cardiac anomaly,* life history without surgical treatment is similar to that of patients with large fossa ovalis ASDs (see Natural History in Chapter 30). Important pulmonary vascular disease develops in a small number of patients in their 20s, 30s, and 40s.P4 As in other types of large ASD, symptomatic deterioration of patients in adult life often coincides with development of atrial fibrillationS9 (Fig. 34-18).

Patients with a *partial AV septal defect* and *moderate or severe left AV valve regurgitation* have a different natural history. Because of a nonrestrictive interatrial communication, severe left atrial and pulmonary venous hypertension are absent, but the left-to-right shunt is large and pulmonary artery pressure usually at least moderately elevated. Probably at least 20% of such individuals are severely symptomatic in infancy, and without surgical treatment, many would die in the first decade of life.

Patients with a *complete AV septal defect* have a still more unfavorable natural history. Because no group of infants known to have this malformation has been followed from birth without surgical intervention, the ideal database for delineation of their natural history does not exist. The closest approach is the prospective study of 56,109 live births by Mitchell and colleagues that included 10 infants judged to have isolated complete AV septal defect (excluding four stillbirths with the malformation), 4 of whom died within the first 3 years of life.M15 This information is inconclusive, however, because of the small number of patients involved; failure to obtain a positive diagnosis by surgery, autopsy, or cardiac catheterization in all patients in the study; use of surgical intervention in some cases; and nonreporting of specific ages of the six survivors.

Rightward posterior border of normal LV outflow tract is formed by AV septal tissue, not mitral valve. *(2)* In 50-degree LAO projections, the rightward anterior margin of the normal outflow tract consists of the basal ventricular sinus (inlet) septum: membranous above, muscular below. Mitral valve attachments do not reach the septal margin. *(3, 4)* In AV septal defects, absence of AV septum and adjacent deficiency of basal (inlet) ventricular septum modify left AV valve attachments and position and shape of left AV orifice and LV outflow tract. **B,** LV cineangiograms in 40-degree RAO projections. *(1, 2)* Normal features can be compared with those of typical partial *(3, 4)* and complete *(5, 6)* AV septal defect in systole and diastole. In the normal heart, mitral (left AV valve) leaflets contribute only to the lowest portion of rightward posterior LV outflow margin in systole, the relatively immobile AV septum forming the remainder of this margin throughout cardiac cycle in diastole. Line of attachment *(m)* of mural (posterior) leaflet of mitral valve can be identified, because contrast is trapped between leaflet and adjacent LV wall. In AV septal defects, rightward posterior margin of LV outflow tract consists of mobile leaflet tissue: left superior leaflet *(s)* above and left inferior leaflet *(i)* below. AV septum is absent. Mural leaflet attachment lies in relatively normal position. When there is complete attachment of left superior and inferior leaflets to septal crest *(dashed line)*, LV outflow tract deformity is well marked in systole, and position of septal crest can be identified in diastole, with contrast being trapped between open leaflets and septum. When there is a large interventricular communication with superior and inferior leaflets free-floating or attached to septal crest by thin chordae only *(5, 6)*, systolic deformity may be less marked and septal crest may be invisible, because contrast is washed away by non-radiopaque inflow. RAO view separates an AV regurgitant stream *(AVR)* from an interventricular shunt *(VS)*.

Figure 34-15, cont'd C, Left ventricular (LV) cineangiograms in 50-degree left anterior oblique (LAO) projection. (1, 2) In normal heart, septal margin of LV outflow tract is uninterrupted in systole and diastole. In AV septal defect (3-8), septal margin is interrupted by defect in basal (inlet) ventricular septum, the defect being continuous with left AV orifice. (3, 4) When left superior (s) and inferior (i) leaflets are completely attached to septal crest, as in partial AV septal defect, leaflet tissue bulges into defect in systole, and position of septal crest (c) can be identified in diastole. (7, 8) When there is a large interventricular communication, systolic flow into right ventricle can be observed passing beneath left superior (upper arrow) or left inferior (lower arrow) leaflets. In diastole, a common AV orifice is identified. (5, 6) In some cases, attachments to septal crest are present but leave smaller interventricular communications. AV valve regurgitation tends to obscure valve detail as overlying atria opacify. **D**, LV or left atrial cineangiograms of AV septal defect in 50-degree LAO with cranial angulation (axial, hepatoclavicular, or four-chamber view). (1) Arrows in 40-degree RAO view illustrate why conventional LAO (part **C**) shows full height of the AV orifice, providing the best separation of left superior from left inferior leaflets. Cranially tilted version of LAO (CR LAO) foreshortens AV orifice and tends to superimpose these leaflets. (2, 3) However, the characteristic deformity of septal and AV orifice anatomy seen in conventional LAO view can be appreciated in axial LAO views, which are shown in both systole and diastole. In addition, midmuscular and apical parts of the sinus septum are better separated from basal defect so that additional muscular defects in cross-hatched area (e.g., at x) may be identified. AV valve regurgitation obscures detail, but partial separation of atria from ventricles improves differentiation of regurgitation from interventricular shunting. With a left atrial or right upper pulmonary venous injection in 50-degree LAO with cranial angulation (4), contrast flow (arrows) early in the sequence shows position of atrial septal defect adjacent to AV valves. Contrast enters right atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle. Cranial angulation rarely achieves a perfect profile of AV anulus, and ventricular opacification obscures detail later in the sequence.

Loss of straight line contour from aortic valve to crux cordis indicates absence of major part of AV septum. **B,** AV septal defect with two AV valve orifices and an interventricular communication.

An important event in the natural history is development of severe pulmonary vascular disease. This complication becomes apparent at 7 to 12 months of age in up to 30% of patients with complete AV septal defect and is probably present in 90% of such patients by age 3 to 5 years.F3,N2 Thus, its prevalence in early life is higher in patients with complete AV septal defect than in those with large VSD.

In the absence of a definitive prospective study, approximation of natural history of complete AV septal defect has been constructed from 39 patients in two reports of

**C,** Complete atrioventricular (AV) septal defect shown by left ventriculogram in four-chamber view.

autopsies.B11 This analysis indicates that about 80% of patients who do not undergo operation die by age 2 years (Fig. 34-19). A child surviving to age 1 year has only about a 15% chance of living to age 5. Those who die in the first 1 to 2 years of life usually do so with heart failure, with or without recurrent pulmonary infections, as a result of the large left-to-right shunt and moderate-to-severe AV valve regurgitation present in 60%.S15 The high incidence of death in the first year of life has been confirmed by Samanek.S1 Thereafter, valve regurgitation and increasing pulmonary vascular disease become dominant factors in the natural history. Newfeld and colleagues showed histologically that advanced pulmonary vascular disease (Heath-Edwards grade 3 and 4; see "Pulmonary Vascular Disease" under Morphology in Section I of Chapter 35) is occasionally present in such infants, even in the first year of life.N2 However, it is

present in nearly 90% of patients older than age 1 year (7 of their 8 specimens).

Bull and colleagues dispute these inferences and deduce a more favorable prognosis for infants with complete AV septal defects based on a study of patients with Down syndrome and this anomaly.B21 Careful study of their report generates uncertainty as to the appropriateness of analyses underlying their inferences, however.K8,W9

Another aspect of the natural history of patients with AV septal defects is the tendency of their offspring to have similar defects or other congenital cardiac malformations. Emanuel and colleagues found that 14% of children of mothers with AV septal defects have congenital heart diseaseE8; half have tetralogy of Fallot, and half have AV septal defects. This prevalence is much higher than the 2% to 4% among children of parents with other types of congenital heart disease.N4

## TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

Surgical treatment of AV septal defects is directed toward (1) closing the interatrial communication, which is virtually always present; (2) closing the interventricular communication if one is present; (3) avoiding damage to the AV node and bundle of His; and (4) maintaining or creating two competent, nonstenotic AV valves.

Repair techniques vary considerably, but when used properly, all appear to provide good results.E1,L1 For example:

- One or two patches may be used to repair the malformation when there is large interventricular communication.R3
- A markedly bridging LSL may be divided to facilitate the repair, or it may be left intact.B17,R4,S15

(From Berger and colleagues.B11)

- The AV node and bundle of His may be avoided by staying on the LV and left atrial side (McGoon DC: personal communication, 1978) or by staying on the right side of the septum.S15
- Contiguous surfaces of the LSL and LIL may be sutured together, or the left AV valve may be left as a tricuspid structure.C2,R6
- The patch may be attached to leaflet tissue by simple sutures or by pledgeted mattress sutures with some sort of sandwich method,S15 with assortment of techniques employed to establish AV valve competence.C2

Methods described in this chapter are the product of experiences in several centers and have improved surgical results. They avoid functionally important damage to the conduction system, provide complete and permanent closure of interatrial and interventricular communications, and are suitable for the many variations across the spectrum of AV septal defects. They are well adapted to cases with major associated cardiac anomalies. They retain AV valve competence when it is present, minimize occurrence of valve repair dehiscence, and generally abolish or lessen AV valve regurgitation, although in this regard the results are imperfect, particularly in patients without interventricular communications.K6,S15 The same improvements have been obtained while retaining the singlepatch technique. Addition of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to assess completeness of repair provides a further safeguard against an imperfect anatomic and functional result.R9

Repair of Complete Atrioventricular Septal Defect with Little or No Bridging of Left Superior and Left Inferior Leaflets: Rastelli Type A

#### *Two-Patch Technique*

After the usual preparations, a median sternotomy is made, a large piece of pericardium is removed and set aside, and pericardial stay sutures are applied. External cardiac anatomy is evaluated and a left superior vena cava sought. If one is present, there is a 50% chance of associated unroofed coronary sinus syndrome. Purse-string sutures are placed.

In patients weighing less than 5 kg, repair may be performed with limited cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with a single venous cannula and hypothermic circulatory arrest; in larger patients, standard CPB is used. Alternatively, in both infants and older children, hypothermic CPB at 20°C and cold cardioplegia may be used. In this method, the cavae are cannulated directly with thin-walled, right-angled metal cannulae (see "Venous Cannulation" in Section III of Chapter 2). CPB flow is reduced to about 1.2 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> when the patient's temperature reaches 20°C. Short periods of circulatory arrest or low flow perfusion are occasionally used if visibility is not excellent. As cooling proceeds, the aorta is clamped, and cold cardioplegic solution is injected. The right atrium is opened widely, and a sump sucker is passed through the foramen ovale into the left atrium. Stay sutures are applied.

The malformation is examined and each morphologic detail noted (Fig. 34-20). Morphology of the LSL and LIL is noted carefully with the leaflets in both the closed and open positions. Cold saline solution is injected once or twice through the valve and the closure pattern and any regurgitant leaks studied (Fig. 34-21, *A-C*). The most anterior point of LSL-LIL opposing edges is found, and a double-armed 6-0 or 7-0 polypropylene suture is placed through it. Leaflet stay and marking sutures are placed, measurements are made, and the polyester interventricular patch is trimmed.

The patch is sutured to the right side of the crest of the ventricular septum with continuous polypropylene suture (Fig. 34-21, *D* and *E*). Chordae of the RSL and RIL stay on the right ventricular side of the patch; those of the LSL and LIL stay on the LV side, and some may be cut if they interfere with the suturing, because the anterior edges of these leaflets will be sutured to the polyester patch.

When this phase is completed, the marking suture on the anterior edges of the coapting surfaces of the LSL-LIL complex is passed through the appropriate point of the edge of the polyester ventricular defect patch. The pericardial interatrial patch is then trimmed to appropriate shape and size, and the first part of its insertion is accomplished (Fig. 34-21, *F*). For this, interrupted mattress sutures of 5-0 or 6-0 polyester are placed to enclose anterior edges of the LSL and LIL between the polyester patch below and pericardial patch above. Alternatively, left-sided leaflet tissue is anchored as a separate maneuver to the polyester patch; the pericardial atrial

**Figure 34-20** Repair of complete atrioventricular *(AV)* septal defect; right atrial view, showing two variations of bridging. **A,** Bridging grade 1. **B,** Bridging grade 4. In both there is a common AV orifice and interventricular communication. AV node lies on right side of inferior (caudad) atrial septal remnant at its junction with floor of right atrium over crux cordis. Node pierces abnormally formed central fibrous body to become the short penetrating portion of bundle of His. This structure immediately becomes the branching bundle, which gives off left bundle branches earlier than normal as it travels along crest of ventricular septum. **C,** Cross-section through AV septal defect with common AV valve orifice showing mild bridging of left inferior leaflet *(LIL)* and scooped-out crest of ventricular septum.

septal patch is then sewn to the leaflet-patch line of attachment. Great care is taken to ensure alignment of left AV valve leaflets is perfect and without distortion during this process.

Saline solution is again injected through the left-sided portion of the AV valves (two orifices are present once the interventricular patch is in place) to study its closure pattern and competence. A few additional "tailoring sutures" are placed without tension along the coapting surfaces of the LSL and LIL near the patch, if needed, to prevent systolic eversion or prolapse; usually they are not required. If a central leak (at the point of junction of LSL, LIL, and LLL) persists, an

**Figure 34-21** Repair of complete atrioventricular (AV) septal defect. **A,** After right atrium is opened, valve leaflets are often closed exactly as they are in systole. If, instead, they are open, saline is injected into left ventricle to close them. At this point, morphology of the leaflets, particularly their closure pattern, is studied and information obtained is used to plan repair of any regurgitation present or accommodate any lack of left AV valve tissue. **B,** A fine polypropylene suture is placed between left superior leaflet *(LSL)* and left inferior leaflet *(LIL)* in position shown (anterior aspect) and left loose. **C,** Leaflets are allowed to open, and details of atrial and ventricular septal deficiencies and of interatrial and interventricular communications are studied. Position of coronary sinus *(CS)* is noted, and course of the unseen AV node and bundle of His is conceptualized by surgeon from knowledge of the anatomy. Leaflets are retracted as much as possible and projected width (shown here) and depth of AV patch estimated. Planned suture line of interventricular patch to ventricular septum and free wall is thus visualized by surgeon. **D,** Polyester ventricular patch is trimmed to a flat, rectangular-pyramidal shape. Suture line may begin anywhere along ventricular septum, but it must be on the right ventricular side of all chordae from left-sided leaflets, including those from any bridging components of the LIL. Retractor in right inferior aspect of the common valve marks position in which base of right inferior leaflet *(RIL)* is sandwiched between ventricular and atrial patches. Suture line here stays well back from crest of interventricular septum and catches some of the base of the RIL to avoid the bundle of His. *Continued*

anuloplasty stitch is placed in the region of the commissure between the LSL and LLL. If necessary and if the orifice is large enough, a similar stitch can be placed at the LLL-LIL commissure, the surgeon being certain not to approach the AV node. This part of the operation is critically important and requires patience and ingenuity (see "Repair of Complete or Partial Atrioventricular Septal Defect with Moderate or Severe Left Atrioventricular Valve Regurgitation" under Technique of Operation).

Assessment of both the left and right AV valves at this point includes consideration of their size. The diameter of each is estimated with Hegar dilators and considered

![](_page_27_Figure_2.jpeg)

**E,** Suture line for interventricular patch is completed anteriorly, retracting defect posteriorly and elevating the RSL to expose the aspect of the defect closest to left ventricular outflow tract. Width of patch at the valve level will be less than its width deeper on ventricular septum level. **F,** Left superior leaflet *(LSL)* and left inferior leaflet *(LIL)* are precisely anchored to ventricular septal patch using fine interrupted simple or mattress sutures. It is here that care is taken to ensure that the left-sided valve apparatus at the patch is appropriately narrow so as not to create regurgitation and at the correct height so as not to produce left ventricular outflow tract narrowing (too low) or left AV valve regurgitation (too high). To provide accuracy, the previously placed fine stay suture joining LSL and LIL is positioned approximately at midpoint of the suture line. **G,** Pericardial patch for closure of the atrial defect is trimmed to size and a new suture line is begun with bites incorporating pericardial patch, left AV valve tissue (at its junction with the top of the polyester patch), and polyester patch, sandwiching delicate left AV valve tissue between pericardium and fabric. Initial suturing at crest of polyester patch can be done with the pericardial patch folded leftward toward left AV valve. Conduction system is avoided by extending the pericardium to the right of the coronary sinus, leaving its drainage to left atrium. Competence of left (and right) AV valve is next tested with saline injection. If necessary, small anuloplasty sutures can be placed between LSL and left lateral leaflet (LLL) and between LIL and LLL. **H,** Remainder of pericardial patch is sutured inferiorly and then superiorly to rim of atrial defect, often also incorporating closure of foramen ovale defect. Key: *RLL,* Right lateral leaflet; *RSL,* right superior leaflet. **Figure 34-21, cont'd**

acceptable if within 2 SD of normal for the size of the patient (*z* value is −2 or greater; see Chapter 1, Appendix 1D, Table 1D-2).

Repair is completed by suturing the rest of the pericardial interatrial patch in place, with the suture line passing *around* the AV node and bundle of His and not across them (Fig. 34-21, *G* and *H*). The right-sided leaflets are usually not sutured to the patch because they close competently without this. If any commissural tissue between the LSL and RSL or LIL and RIL is cut, the right side of this (as well as the left side) is sutured to the patch.

Rewarming of the patient is begun (see "Completing Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2). A few sutures are placed, but not pulled up or tied, for closure of the foramen ovale. Air is evacuated through the foramen ovale, and the aortic clamp is removed with suction on the needle vent.

The first stitch for closure of the right atriotomy is placed at its inferior angle, and closure of the right atriotomy is continued up to the midportion. Usually, cardiac action has begun by then, so the pump sump-sucker is removed from the right atrium and sutures closing the foramen ovale are tied, with care taken to avoid trapping air in the left atrium. The remainder of the right atrium is closed and caval tapes released. Assessment at this stage of the morphologic and functional result by two-dimensional color flow Doppler TEE is useful.S7 If important abnormalities are present, CPB and cardioplegia are reestablished and corrections made. Otherwise, the remainder of the operation is completed in the usual manner (see "Completing Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2 and "Cold Cardioplegia, Controlled Aortic Root Reperfusion, and [When Needed] Warm Cardioplegic Induction" in Chapter 3). Left and right atrial and pulmonary artery pressure-monitoring catheters are placed.

Alternatively, when hypothermic circulatory arrest is used in infants, circulatory arrest is continued until the right atrium is closed, provided the procedure can be completed within 45 minutes (which is usually possible). The single venous cannula is then reinserted, the heart is de-aired, CPB for rewarming is begun, and the remainder of the procedure continues as usual. (For repair that requires more than 45 minutes, the sequence described in Chapter 2, Section IV, is adopted.)

## Repair of Complete Atrioventricular Septal Defect with Bridging of Left Superior Leaflet: Rastelli Type B or C

Repair is similar to that just described, but special consideration is given to the LSL. Whether bridging is moderate (Rastelli type B) or marked (Rastelli type C), the commissure between it and the RSL is generally only slightly on the right ventricular side of the intersection of the atrial (and ventricular) septum with the anulus. This location is critically important because, again, suturing for insertion of the interventricular polyester patch usually begins in the anulus at the level of this commissural tissue. If suturing in the anulus is too far anterior—that is, too far on the right ventricular side of the junction of anulus with atrial septum either by error or because the LSL-RSL commissure is far anterior, the right AV valve orifice will be too narrow. Narrowing of its orifice can also be produced by attaching the

**Figure 34-22** Depiction of ventricular septal portion of two-patch technique. If patch is too wide, theoretically left ventricular outlet flow obstruction may be produced. If patch is too long, with level of atrioventricular (AV) valves too high, there is a high probability of left AV valve regurgitation. (Modified from Lacour-Gayet and colleagues.L1)

interventricular polyester patch too far to the right of the crest of the septum with the first few superior (cephalad) stitches. Compensation too far leftward narrows the LV outflow tract.

The interventricular patch is slid beneath the chordae going from the right extremity of the LSL to right ventricular papillary muscles. The interventricular patch must have appropriate dimensions and configuration (Fig. 34-22). If the patch is excessively wide (in a superior-inferior direction), there is greater likelihood of postoperative LV outflow tract obstruction. If the patch is excessively long (deep, in a caudad-cephalad direction), there is a greater likelihood of left AV valve regurgitation.

Incising the LSL from its free edge to the anulus is rarely necessary, although in extreme cases in which a small right AV valve would otherwise result, it may be done, with both divided edges later sutured onto the interventricular polyester patch.

## Repair of Complete Atrioventricular Septal Defect with Single-Patch Technique

Repair using a single patch differs from the two-patch technique in the following ways: (1) the single patch is almost always pericardium, (2) tailoring the waist of the patch (at the level of the AV valves) is critical, and (3) both the LSL and RSL and the LIL and RIL are sutured to the patch. Setup using bicaval cannulation is the same as for the two-patch technique, making sure that the inferior vena cava cannula is placed well caudad at the cavoatrial junction. CPB is established at 20°C to 24°C, and antegrade cardioplegia is infused after aortic clamping. The right atrial incision is made and atrial exposure is arranged as for the two-patch technique. The most anterior point of LSL-LIL apposing edges is identified, and a 6-0 polypropylene suture is placed to retain that apposing relationship. Bridging leaflets superiorly and occasionally inferiorly are incised laterally to the valve anulus (Fig. 34-23, *A*). This maneuver allows easy later exposure for closing the intraventricular portion of the defect and accommodating the waist of the patch.

The patch for the ventricular septal closure is inserted using continuous polypropylene or interrupted synthetic braided mattress sutures. Generally the initial suture is placed at the midpoint of the ventricular defect and is continued upward anteriorly (Fig. 34-23, *B*). Posteriorly, the suture line stays behind the rim of the defect to avoid conduction fibers. Both left and right AV valve leaflets are then anchored to the waist of the patch using double-pledgeted horizontal mattress sutures (Fig. 34-23, *C*). Pledgets are

![](_page_29_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 34-23** Complete atrioventricular (AV) septal defect repair, single-patch technique. **A,** Right atriotomy is made as for two-patch technique and AV valves are inspected. Saline is infused into ventricles as for two-patch technique, and apposition point of left superior leaflet *(LSL)* and left inferior leaflet *(LIL)* is identified as the leaflets float up to their systolic position. A fine guy suture is placed for alignment and left loose. Frequently, the bridging LSL or LIL is incised to gain access to the anterior portion of interventricular defect. Later, each cut edge of the superior leaflet will be attached to pericardial patch at its waist. **B,** Fresh or glutaraldehyde-treated pericardial patch is trimmed partially after measuring height and width of interventricular communication. Generally, ventricular portion of patch is attached to right side of crest of ventricular septum using a continuous suture initiated at the deepest aspect (midpoint) of the rim of the ventricular septal defect *(VSD)*. Usual precautions are taken as in the two-patch technique to avoid the bundle of His at posterior-inferior aspect of ventricular defect. **C,** AV leaflets, both left and right, are attached to pericardial patch at appropriate level. As in the two-patch technique, the central guy suture, which approximates the gap between LSL and LIL, helps position the AV valves at correct height and midpoint on the single pericardial patch. Interrupted horizontal mattress sutures incorporate bites of right-sided valve tissue, pass through pericardium, and end with bites of left-sided valve tissue. Small pledgets of pericardium may be used to buttress sutures on left and right AV valve tissue. Several additional sutures complete closure of gap between LSL and LIL.

generally of pericardium; often a single strip is used on the left-sided aspect. The strip is made a little shorter than the anteroposterior width of the anulus to somewhat narrow the anulus and contribute to AV valve competency. The level of this suture line (in a cephalad-caudad direction) must

ensure that height of the AV valve anulus is such that left AV valve regurgitation is avoided (patch too high) and LV outflow obstruction is not produced (patch too low). At this point, the LV is loaded by saline injection to test valve competency and VSD closure. The left AV valve cleft is closed

**D,** Atrial portion of patch is completed with continuous suture extending inferiorly and medially to place coronary sinus *(CS)* on left atrial side, incorporating any foramen ovale defect within superior rim of patch.

with fine interrupted sutures at its opposing edges to the previously placed marking suture. At this point if necessary, anuloplasty sutures (horizontal mattress) are placed at the two lateral commissures. Repair of the remaining atrial defect proceeds as for the two-patch technique (Fig. 34-23, *D*), outside the rim of the coronary sinus and including the foramen ovale defect. The completed single pericardial patch has a lopsided, dumbbell-shaped configuration (Fig. 34-23, *E*).

#### Repair of Complete Atrioventricular Septal Defect with Modified Single-Patch Technique

In 1997, Wilcox and colleagues reported direct suturing of the AV valves to the ventricular septum in complete AV septal defects with a small ventricular component.W6 Others extended the application of this technique to all forms of complete AV septal defects.N3,N5 The advantages of this procedure are (1) simplicity by avoiding a separate patch for VSD closure, (2) no division of valve leaflets or chordae, and (3) reduced operative time.

Key features of the procedure are illustrated in Fig. 34-24. Interrupted pledgeted 5-0 braided sutures are placed on the right side of the interventricular septal crest (as in the ventricular septal suture line of the standard ventricular patch technique) and passed through the bridging LSL and LIL. These sutures are then passed through the edge of the autologous pericardial patch used to close the atrial defect and through a thin strip of polyester whose length is slightly shorter than the corresponding ventricular septum, with the intent of producing a central anuloplasty of the LSL and LIL. These sutures are tied, and the remainder of the operation proceeds as in the single- or two-patch techniques.

Nunn and colleagues reported uniform application for all patients with complete AV septal defects, 30-day mortality of less than 2%, no reoperations for residual VSDs, and no reoperations for LV outflow tract obstruction out to a median follow-up of 7.3 years.N5 This procedure has now been widely applied in the setting of shallow ventricular defects. General acceptance of its wider application to all defects awaits analyses from other institutions.

#### Repair of Partial Atrioventricular Septal Defect with Little or No Left Atrioventricular Valve Regurgitation

Repair is similar to that described for complete AV septal defects, but no interventricular polyester patch is required. After CPB is established, intraatrial exposure is arranged, cold cardioplegic solution infused, and morphology studied. Attachments of the LSL and LIL to the crest of the ventricular septum are probed to be certain there are no small interventricular communications.

The "cleft" in the AV valve is then identified and its medial and septal extremities noted (Fig. 34-25, *A-C*). In the past, if there were no left AV valve regurgitation, nothing was done to the valve at the cleft (commissure). More recently, most surgeons obliterate this gap (close the cleft) using several interrupted simple sutures or pericardial pledgeted mattress sutures. The margins here are characterized by slightly thickened and rolled edges, and it is at these margins that sutures are based.

An anuloplasty stitch may also be placed at the LSL-LLL commissure. The intraatrial pericardial patch is sewn into place in the same way used for repairing complete AV septal defect (Fig. 34-25, *D*; see also Fig. 34-21). Small, pledgeted mattress sutures of 5-0 or 6-0 polyester are passed from the right ventricular side through the base of the RIL and the

**Figure 34-24** Repair of complete atrioventricular septal defect with modified single-patch technique. **A,** Cross-section through defect with atrial and ventricular communications. **B,** Interrupted pledgeted 5-0 braided sutures are placed on right side of interventricular septal crest (as in the ventricular septal suture line of standard ventricular patch technique) and passed through bridging left superior leaflet *(LSL)* and left inferior leaflet *(LIL)*. These sutures are then passed through edge of autologous pericardial patch used to close the atrial defect and through a thin strip of Dacron whose length is slightly shorter than the corresponding ventricular septum, with the intent of producing a central anuloplasty of the LSL and LIL. These sutures are tied, and remainder of operation proceeds as in single- or two-patch techniques. (From Nunn.N5)

bridging part of the LIL and through the pericardial patch. More cephalad, the patch is sewn to fibrous valvar tissue attached to the crest of the ventricular septum in this reinforced manner, analogous to its suturing to the top of the polyester patch (see Fig. 34-21).

## Repair of Atrioventricular Septal Defect with Small Interchordal Interventricular Communications (Intermediate Form)

When two AV valve orifices are present but small interventricular communications exist between thick, short chordae attaching the LSL to the crest of the ventricular septum, repair is simple. The interventricular communication is simply closed by taking the anterior portion of the pericardial patch just to the right side of the septal crest, catching the base of the LSL with each stitch.

When the interventricular communications are beneath the LIL, the same maneuver may be followed. However, because of the bundle of His, care must be taken to keep the suture line well away from the crest of the septum and to attach the patch in the same manner in which the interventricular patch is attached in repair of complete AV septal defects.

## Repair of Atrioventricular Septal Defect with Common Atrium

When a common atrium is present, either with or without an interventricular communication, special effort is made to ensure that there is no left superior vena cava or, if one is present, that there is not a completely unroofed coronary sinus, which would change the repair (see Technique of Operation in Chapter 33).

Repair is accomplished by sewing an appropriately larger pericardial patch to the atrial wall on the left atrial side of the orifice of the inferior vena cava, to the right of the right pulmonary veins, and beneath the superior vena cava (where there is usually a small septal remnant).

## Repair of Complete or Partial Atrioventricular Septal Defect with Moderate or Severe Left Atrioventricular Valve Regurgitation

For repair of an AV septal defect with moderate or severe left AV valve regurgitation, results seem to vary from one institution to another, even when the same techniques have apparently been used.

In the repair of complete AV septal defects, the primary determinant of left AV valve competence, particularly when preoperative AV valve regurgitation is moderate or less, is accurate sizing of the ventricular patch (or patch component) to produce an anuloplasty effect (width somewhat less than the combined width of the LSL and LIL) and avoiding elevation by the patch of the LSL and LIL above their pre-repair level (see Fig. 34-22). If the size and placement of the patch have been imperfect, this should be corrected.

If the patch and its placement are considered optimal, the basic options depend on observations about location and mechanism of regurgitation by filling the LV with saline:

■ If the major leakage is between the LSL and LIL, the "cleft" is partially or completely closed with interrupted 5-0 polypropylene or braided sutures, which may be reinforced with small bovine pericardial pledgets if the leaflet tissue is fragile.

![](_page_32_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 34-25** Repair of partial atrioventricular *(AV)* septal defect. **A,** Cross-section through defect with an atrial communication and intact ventricular septum. **B,** Right atrium is opened in a superior-to-inferior direction. (Inferior vena cava cannula is placed well caudal.) Atrial defect (primum ASD) is seen with its inferior border composed partially of AV valve tissue. A search is made for interventricular communications as the left-sided AV valve is tested for regurgitation by saline infusion. Extent of cleft is seen and any regurgitation through it identified. *Continued*

- If the leakage is central or at the commissure between the LLL and LSL or between the LLL and LIL, anuloplasty sutures (with or without pledgets) are placed to reduce anular circumference. In cases of marked central leakage and an enlarged orifice, a more extensive anuloplasty of the LLL and its commissures using a polytetrafluoroethylene band has been reported.K5
- If leakage is through accessory clefts, they may be partially closed. When the repair is completed and leakage

is trivial or absent by saline injection, the remaining orifice is sized with Hegar dilators; a measured diameter yielding a *z* value of −2 or greater is generally adequate to avoid valve stenosis.

In the presence of persistent moderate to severe residual regurgitation (particularly in the reoperative setting) despite the maneuvers described above, two other more radical techniques may be applied:

![](_page_33_Picture_2.jpeg)

**C,** Cleft is closed with interrupted sutures; if necessary, anuloplasty sutures are added. **D,** Defect is closed with a pericardial patch, placed in a fashion similar to that used in the two-patch technique for repair of complete AV septal defect. It is inserted using fine continuous polypropylene suture. Suture line begins at the confluence of left- and right-sided AV valves over ventricular septum and passes rightward and caudally over right inferior leaflet to surround the coronary sinus *(CS)*, leaving coronary sinus draining to left atrium. **E,** An alternative to avoid the conduction system is the McGoon technique. Patch is sutured to base of left-sided valve tissue, and in area near conduction system, superficial bites are taken. Key: *LIL,* Left inferior leaflet; *LSL,* left superior leaflet; *RIL,* right inferior leaflet; *RSL,* right superior leaflet. **Figure 34-25, cont'd**

- When there is severe central regurgitation, particularly in the presence of leaflet prolapse, the LLL and the reconstructed anterior leaflet may be approximated with a pledgeted mattress suture, creating a double orifice valveH6,L2,M2,M4,M14 (Fig. 34-26). To avoid physiologic stenosis, care must be taken that the orifice of the reconstructed "mitral" valve is somewhat larger than normal (probably a *z* value of +1 or larger) before placing the approximation suture.
- An additional procedure in the presence of leaflet deficiency that has reported short- and mid-term successM14,P9,R11 (Fig. 34-27) is patch augmentation of the neoanterior leaflet.

If moderate or severe left AV valve regurgitation remains, repair should be immediately reassessed. If, in the surgeon's judgment, improvement by further repair is possible, the patient is returned to CPB. If no further repair is likely, valve

replacement is performed. If the patient is small, no further intervention is feasible, and the infant is managed as well as possible postoperatively.

## Right Atrioventricular Valve

In hearts with or without interventricular communications, the right AV valve usually does not require attention. Twopatch repair leaves this valve without a complete "septal leaflet," but in this and other situations, regurgitation does not result. The RSL and RIL (and the RLL) are well supported by chordae, and this, combined with their closure against the polyester patch or bare ventricular septum, generally results in adequate valve function. However, the right AV valve should be analyzed separately with saline injection and Hegar sizing (valve diameter should provide a *z* value of −2 or greater). If important leakage is identified, it should be surgically addressed. Often, attachment of the RIL to the VSD patch will correct the leakage.

## Left Superior Leaflet–Right Superior Leaflet and Left Inferior Leaflet–Right Inferior Leaflet Commissures

Generally, repair of LSL-RSL and LIL-RIL commissures can be made without disturbing the commissural leaflet tissue in these areas. Occasionally, however, these commissural leaflet areas are larger than usual and handicap exposure. Then they may be incised back to the anulus, *once it is certain that this is commissural tissue!* Tissue on the LV side is incorporated into the repair along with the LSL or LIL. That on the right side should be reattached to the patch with a few sutures at the end of the repair.

## Replacement of Left Atrioventricular Valve

When severe left AV valve regurgitation cannot be repaired, or when it persists or develops postoperatively, left AV valve replacement may be necessary.C3 Because the left AV valve nearly always encroaches on the LV outflow tract (see Figs. 34-5, *A* and 34-10), valve replacement may accentuate or produce subaortic stenosis. The prosthesis must therefore be kept away from the subaortic area. This may be accomplished by attaching a rectangular piece of polyester to the anulus of the left AV valve in the subaortic areaM8,P8,P9 (Fig. 34-28). (Poirier and colleagues describe the outcome of eight patients in which similar augmentation was used at reoperation to increase deficient bridging leaflet coaptation without valve replacement.) The prosthesis is then sutured to this artificial mitral-aortic anulus and to the natural anulus for the rest of its circumference. To minimize the chance of damage to the AV node and bundle of His, particular care is taken anteriorly and inferiorly to sew only to the fringe of left AV

Thus, the valve replacement device is well away from left ventricular outflow tract *(LVOT)*. **B,** Valve replacement device is inserted, sutured to free edge of polyester patch superiorly, anulus posteriorly, and undersurface of pericardial patch anteriorly.

valve that has been preserved. Alternatively, the prosthesis can be attached in a supraanular position using atrial wall to base the sewing ring. When possible, valve replacement should be deferred until childhood, when risk is less.K1 This decision is particularly difficult in infants for whom no device of appropriate size is available. Then, even moderate or severe left AV valve regurgitation must be accepted.

Ebels and colleagues have suggested a somewhat different method for avoiding encroachment on the LV tract by the prosthesis.E1,E3 Their technique involves resecting the atrial fold lying external to the area of fibrous continuity between the aortic leaflets and LSL, presumably along with part of the fibrous continuity. The prosthesis then lies against the aortic valve, rather than in a subvalvar, obstructing position. Clinical evaluation of this method is limited.

## Repair of Complete Atrioventricular Septal Defect with Tetralogy of Fallot

In complete AV septal defect associated with tetralogy of Fallot, the large VSD is also juxtaaortic. The LSL bridges moderately (grade 3) or markedly (grades 4 or 5) and is not attached to the crest of the ventricular septum. Any of the types of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction associated with tetralogy of Fallot may be present (see "Convenient Morphologic Categories of Right Ventricular Outflow Obstruction" under Morphology in Section I of Chapter 38), and anterior deviation of the infundibular septum is always present and must be considered in the repair. Preoperative cineangiographic studies are often necessary to delineate the surgically important details of right ventricular outflow obstruction and morphology of the pulmonary arteries.

Operation is begun as for repair of any complete AV septal defect. Before heparinization, however, if a right ventricular outflow patch is required, an appropriately sized patch is prepared as described in Section I of Chapter 38 (see "Decision and Technique for Transanular Patching" under Technique of Operation). The VSD patch is trimmed with a wide superior aspect, which is important in preventing *left* ventricular outflow obstruction.

Usually the anteriorly deviated parietal extension of the infundibular septum (band) can be seen through the AV valve, and it is cut and mobilized (see "Repair of Uncomplicated Tetralogy of Fallot with Pulmonary Stenosis via Right Atrium" under Technique of Operation in Section I of Chapter 38). Other muscular infundibular obstructions can be visualized and resected. The pulmonary valve can be visualized and fused commissures opened. The right ventricular outflow tract is sized with Hegar dilators. At this point the surgeon may decide on a combined right atrial–right ventricular (RA-RV) approach. If so, a small vertical incision is made in the right ventricular outflow tract, and parietal and septal extensions are mobilized and partially resected. This incision is later closed with a small patch.

The interventricular communication is closed by suturing into place a polyester or pericardial patch from this right atrial approach, sequencing the repair exactly as described for other complete AV septal defects. This can be accomplished with a single- or two-patch technique. With either, the shape of the ventricular component of the patch must be modified to account for the anterior-superior extension of the interventricular communication. Familiarity with the atrial approach for repair of isolated VSD (see Technique of Operation in Section I of Chapter 35) and for repair of the VSD in simple tetralogy of Fallot (see "Repair of Uncomplicated Tetralogy of Fallot with Pulmonary Stenosis via Right Atrium" under Technique of Operation in Section I of Chapter 38), as well as familiarity with repair of uncomplicated complete AV septal defects, are important preparations for this procedure. Stay sutures are placed as usual for transatrial repair. Repair is begun at the AV valve anulus superiorly, where the atrial septal remnant meets the anulus.

Care must be taken that repair does not begin too far rightward, in which case the right side of the surgically partitioned AV valve orifice will be too small. Because of the dextroposed aorta, attachment of the VSD patch to tissue over the aortic root (and beneath the commissural tissue and RSL) is particularly important. The patch is generally beneath (on the *left* ventricular side of) chordae attached to the right extremity of the bridging LSL and beneath this leaflet itself. Because this leaflet will be attached to the VSD patch, some of these chordae may be cut to facilitate exposure. In the single-patch technique, the entire bridging leaflet is incised. The suture line is then carried around the interventricular communication and along the base of the RIL as described earlier for the usual complete AV septal defect. When the aorta overrides the interventricular septum to a considerable degree (and when DORV is present), the juxtaaortic portion of the repair may be completed through a small infundibular incision. Remainder of the AV septal defect is repaired as described earlier.

The right ventricular outflow tract is again sized with Hegar dilators. If it is adequate, nothing further is done. Otherwise, it is enlarged by an infundibular patch, or, if necessary, a transanular patch (see "General Plan and Details of Repair Common to All Approaches" under Technique of Operation in Section I of Chapter 38). Moderate or severe pulmonary regurgitation should be avoided because associated right ventricular dilatation may result in severe right AV valve regurgitation from deficiency of right-sided AV valve tissue. Therefore, the threshold for inserting a valve (monocusp or allograft) in the right ventricular outflow tract is lower than usual.

# Repair of Complete Atrioventricular Septal Defect with Double Outlet Right Ventricle

When the interventricular communication is large and subaortic, configuration and insertion of the interventricular patch are similar to that just described for tetralogy of Fallot. Pulmonary stenosis, when coexisting, is also treated similarly.

When the interventricular communication is not subaortic and cannot be converted into one by septal excision (see "Intraventricular Tunnel Repair of Double Outlet Right Ventricle with Noncommitted Ventricular Septal Defect" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 53), a Fontan repair (see Technique of Operation in Section IV of Chapter 41) is necessary if pulmonary stenosis coexists.

#### Repair with Transposition of the Great Arteries

When size of the LV allows it, usual repair of the AV septal defect is carried out and an arterial switch operation is performed (see "Arterial Switch Operation" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 52).

## SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Usual care as described in Chapter 5 is accorded patients after repair of AV septal defects, but certain features require emphasis. Because of the complexity of repair and despite the generally good results now obtained, vigilance must be exercised to detect any important imperfections in the repair. Thus, TEE or transthoracic echocardiography (if the infant is small) is of great help in the operating room and a few hours after the patient's return to the intensive care unit to verify complete closure of the interatrial and interventricular communications and absence of important AV valve regurgitation. Left atrial pressure more than 6 mmHg higher than right atrial pressure raises the possibility of either severe left AV valve regurgitation or stenosis, although it can result simply from small size and low compliance of the LV (see Chapter 5). Height of the *v* wave is not helpful because, as in all circumstances, this correlates more with height of mean left atrial pressure than with degree of regurgitation. Usual prophylaxis is taken against pulmonary hypertensive crises. Generally this includes introducing a pulmonary artery catheter intraoperatively. Because average age at repair has decreased, this complication is seen less frequently now (see "General Care of Neonates and Infants," Section IV of Chapter 5).

If the patient's condition is not optimal and important residual left AV valve regurgitation is suspected—particularly if deterioration continues over several hours—repeat echocardiographic study in the intensive care unit is advisable. If results of this study are inconclusive, left ventriculographic studies (or some other reliable method of quantifying left AV valve regurgitation) should be considered. Indirect indications, both in the operating room and early postoperatively (including absence of a murmur), are unreliable. If severe regurgitation is demonstrated, reoperation is indicated. Likewise, if the patient's condition is unsatisfactory and a large residual left-to-right shunt is present, reoperation is indicated.

When the patient does not convalesce normally, echocardiographic and possibly left ventriculographic studies before hospital discharge are indicated. Because left AV valve repair failure predisposes the patient to death within the first year after operation, consideration should be given to early reoperation if severe regurgitation is found.

## RESULTS

## Survival

#### *Early (Hospital) Death*

Hospital mortality after repair of *partial AV septal defects* has been low for a long time, dating back to the early experience reported from the Mayo Clinic.R6 In the current era, hospital mortality generally is 1% or less.M13

Hospital mortality after repair of uncomplicated *complete AV septal defects* was 30% to 50% during the early years of cardiac surgery, but has declined steadily in recent years. This has been the result of greatly improved understanding of the morphology of this complex malformation, better surgical techniques, and general improvements in cardiac surgery in infants.G4,K10,M7,M17 These improvements are evident in most major pediatric cardiac surgical programs. Improvement in hospital mortality has been particularly evident in infants.

Major congenital heart disease centers report mortality of under 3% for patients with complete AV septal defects with balanced ventricles undergoing repair in the first 3 to 6 months of life.C16,K14,S18,W4 As is often the case, results from individual centers of excellence are superior to results from unselected institutional studies. The Pediatric Cardiac Care Consortium reported results of 10 years of activity in 25 institutions within the United States.M16 Overall operative mortality was 14% and did not differ between Down and non-Down patients. There were a total of 768 cases, averaging three cases per year per institution. This report should be contrasted with individual institutional reports demonstrating low mortality representing caseloads of 20 to 50 yearly.C16,K14,S18

Even when complete AV septal defect coexists with other major cardiac anomalies such as tetralogy of Fallot, hospital mortality remains generally low.K9 However, other less common major associated anomalies with both partial and complete AV septal defects impose a considerable increase in hospital mortality.

## *Time-Related Survival*

Late outcomes are generally good, with reported 15-year survival of 80% to 90%.C16,H5

# Incremental Risk Factors for Premature Death

## *Earlier Date of Operation*

An earlier date of operation as a risk factor in a surgical experience that covers a large number of years, such as that at UAB (Table 34-11), demonstrates that many risks of repair have been neutralized across the experience.K8,S15 Others report similar experiences.A3,C16,H1,H5 The effect of date of operation on outcome is just as evident in long-term events as it is in hospital mortality. This is dramatically evident in predicted 10-year survival after repair of partial and complete AV septal defects in patients operated on in 1967 versus 1977 and 1985 (Fig. 34-29).

## *Higher New York Heart Association Functional Class*

As in most cardiac surgery, severe preoperative disability (higher New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class) is a risk factor for premature death in both the early and constant hazard phases (see Table 34-11).

## *Important Pre-Repair Atrioventricular Valve Regurgitation*

Important pre-repair regurgitation of either the left AV valve in partial AV septal defects or the common AV valve in complete AV septal defects increases risk of premature death, but only in the constant hazard phase (see Table 34-11). This suggests that post-repair moderate regurgitation, the prevalence of which is almost surely increased by severe preoperative regurgitation in patients with partial AV septal defects

but probably less so in patients with complete AV septal defects, is reasonably well tolerated early postoperatively but becomes more serious several months later.W4 However, severe left AV valve regurgitation is poorly tolerated in infants post-repair and is a risk factor for early mortality (see Table 34-11).

#### *Interventricular Communication*

An interventricular communication (complete AV septal defect) has been an important risk factor, but only in the early declining hazard phase. The effect of this aspect of morphology indicates that outcomes after repair of complete AV septal defects currently approximate those of partial AV septal defects, which have been excellent for many yearsR6 (see Fig. 34-29). Residual interventricular communication after repair of complete AV septal defect may be an infrequent cause for reoperation and a risk factor for premature death. Early postoperative residual VSD should be suspected in the presence of "pulmonary hypertensive crisis" and low cardiac output.

Solid lines are survival estimates, and dashed lines are 70% confidence limits. (See original publication for details, risk factors, coefficients, and *P* values of multivariable equation.) (From Kirklin and colleagues.K8)

# *Accessory Valve Orifice*

An accessory valve orifice is an incremental risk factor for premature death (see Table 34-11), almost surely because of its potentially adverse effect on function of the surgically created left AV valveC6,C15,L4,S15 (see description under Morphology earlier in this chapter). Despite the realization that the accessory orifice should not be "tampered with," this risk factor has not been neutralized.H1

## *Major Associated Cardiac Anomalies*

Included among important risk factors are major associated cardiac anomalies (see Table 34-11), but some of them, particularly tetralogy of Fallot, have been largely neutralized.

#### *Young Age*

Young age has been an incremental risk factor for death, usually hospital death, in all experiences that go back 30 years or so.B12,H5 However, it has been virtually eliminated as a risk factor,H1,K8,K14,P3,S18,W4 primarily because of overall improvement in knowledge and repair techniques, but also because of advances in intraoperative and early postoperative care of infants. However, despite low hospital mortality, lower weight among infants is associated with more frequent postoperative complications and longer hospital stay.K14

#### *Down Syndrome*

Risk-adjusted analysis does not show that Down syndrome affects risk of premature death early or late after repair, except when complete AV septal defect is associated with tetralogy of Fallot.K8,K9,N1,S15 However, in view of the considerably decreased prevalence of LV inflow and outflow obstruction in patients with AV septal defects and Down syndrome, these patients may in fact have a better early and intermediate-term survival than patients without Down syndrome. The left AV valve may also be easier to repair, lessening the likelihood of late death from mitral regurgitation.W5

## *Need for Reoperation*

The need for reoperation to insert a pacemaker, close a residual interventricular communication, or deal with important left AV valve regurgitation has been associated with added risk of death.H1

# *Other Risk Factors*

Other incremental risk factors for premature death after repair have been reported. A single papillary muscle (see description under Morphology earlier in this chapter) becomes a serious problem after repair because of its tendency to result in LV inflow obstruction. It may therefore be a contraindication to typical two-ventricle repair. Severe ventricular hypoplasia is a risk factor for hospital death after a two-ventricle repair.S15 Severe LV hypoplasia is more common in patients with complete AV septal defects than is severe right ventricular hypoplasia (see "Unbalanced Atrioventricular Septal Defects" under Special Situations and Controversies). Most hearts with severe LV hypoplasia are properly classified and treated as part of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (see Chapter 49).

# Heart Block and Other Arrhythmias

Since Lev described the architecture of the conduction system in AV septal defects in 1958, prevalence of surgically induced permanent complete heart block has been approximately 1%.L5 Avoiding heart block is generally facilitated by incorporating the coronary sinus on the left atrial side of the atrial patch. An equally low occurrence of heart block can also be accomplished by maintaining the coronary sinus on the right atrial side as long as appropriate attention is given to the anatomy of the conduction system (see also discussion under Special Situations and Controversies).B7 Heart block is more frequent after repair of AV septal defect associated with tetralogy of Fallot and after AV valve replacement.N1,S15

First-degree AV block, present in about 30% of patients preoperatively, has been found in about 50% of patients after repair.F2 Right bundle branch block is common after repair of complete AV septal defects but uncommon after repair of partial AV septal defects.F2

In an earlier UAB experience, when left AV valve replacement was required, heart block occurred in 4 of 20 patients (20%; CL 10%-33%).S15 This is because sutures placed in the left AV valve anulus at about the 2-o'clock position overlie the AV node. A fringe of AV valve tissue must be left in this area so that valve replacement sutures can be placed there and more anteriorly in the interatrial pericardial patch, rather than along the ventricular septal crest. Placing the prosthesis in supraanular position is also helpful.K2 With these precautions, complete heart block is minimized.

## Functional Status

Most long-term survivors are in excellent health. In one center, 88% of surviving patients were in NYHA functional class I, and 11% were in class II.K8,S15

## Atrioventricular Valve Function

Doppler color flow interrogation combined with twodimensional echocardiography have increased the knowledge about postrepair left AV valve function considerably. Also,

![](_page_39_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 34-30** Hazard functions for death after repair of atrioventricular *(AV)* septal defects, one determined from analysis of those patients known to have had failure of the AV valve repair (*n* = 32; deaths = 19) and the other from analysis of those without valve repair failure (*n* = 278; deaths = 51). (From Kirklin and colleagues.K8)

the reinforced leaflet method of repair has appeared to improve results.S15,W4 Better techniques for repairing the left AV valve have played a major role in improving overall results, because patients whose repair fails are likely to have a considerably higher death rate in the intermediate and long term than are patients whose valve repair is good (Fig. 34-30). Left AV valve regurgitation is the major cause of reoperation.A7,C16,S16

After repair of *partial AV septal defects*, about 10% of patients have late severe left AV valve regurgitation, and such patients are more likely to have had severe regurgitation prior to the repair.A1,C7,K7,L8,L12, M10,S15 Generally these patients have a deficiency of the LIL of the AV valve; to date, valve replacement has been the only certain method of achieving left AV valve competence in such patients.B16,M10 Lesser degrees of regurgitation are present late postoperatively in about half of patientsA2,M10; 30% to 40% have essentially no left AV valve regurgitation late postoperatively. Recent studiesM13 suggest that moderate or worse postoperative left AV valve regurgitation is more common in children repaired after about 4 years of age, possibly related to longer exposure to LV volume overload and anular dilatation induced by the regurgitation.

In patients undergoing repair of *complete AV septal defects*, there appears to be little relationship between preoperative severity of AV valve regurgitation and that present late postoperatively in some studies,W4 but in others, an association is suggested.A11,C16 Use of single- vs. two-patch technique of repair does not increase the likelihood of early or late postrepair left AV valve regurgitation.K15

More severe abnormalities of left AV valve morphology, including deficient LLL,S18 papillary muscle abnormalities of the LLL, incomplete commissures, double orifice valve, and severe disparities in length of the LSL and LIL contributing to the "cleft," have been associated with a greater likelihood of postoperative left AV valve regurgitation.A11 Absence of "cleft" closure has been identified as a risk factor for late reoperation for valve regurgitation.H5

About 10% to 20% of infants and older patients have important regurgitation late postoperatively, with the remainder having little or none.S15,W4 Despite general improvements in surgical techniques, late reoperation for left AV valve regurgitation has remained a challenge.C16,S16 When reoperation is necessary, left AV valve repair is possible in about half the patients; the rest require valve replacement.A7,P9,S16 Stulak and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic found no difference in subsequent survival or freedom from additional operations according to whether valve repair or replacement was performed.S16

Repair of uncomplicated partial and complete AV septal defects uncommonly results in stenosis of the left AV valve. More often, this complication results when an accessory valve orifice or single papillary muscle coexists with the AV septal defect.

Important regurgitation or stenosis of the right AV valve is rare after repair of AV septal defects.

## Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction

Uncommonly, LV outflow tract obstruction develops after repair of AV septal defects. As predicted on anatomic grounds by Ebels and colleagues, the AV septal defect has usually been the partial form.E3 Prevalence of clinically significant late outflow obstruction is probably about 5% after repair of partial AV septal defect, which is up to three times more frequent than with the complete form.K7,M6,P7

When LV outflow obstruction develops, it may be associated with worsening left AV valve regurgitation; its relief usually permits regression of the regurgitation.

Prevalence of subaortic LV outflow tract obstruction late after repair of complete AV septal defect is not precisely known, but not negligible. Obstruction may have the appearance characteristic of discrete subaortic stenosis, with an "acquired fibromuscular ridge" (see "Resection of Localized Subvalvar Aortic Stenosis" in Section II of Chapter 47), or it may appear to result from the long, narrow LV outflow tract itself.S4 In either case, simple resection rarely suffices. Extensive transaortic myectomy or the modified Konno operation, without aortic valve replacement, is indicated (see "Modified Konno Operation" in Section II of Chapter 47). Other techniques have been described that specifically address the scooped-out deficiency in the ventricular septum by detaching the LSL attachments to the crest of the ventricular septum and augmenting the anterosuperior aspect of the VSD patch or the LSL with a pericardial patch, followed by reattachment of the LSL. This moves the left AV valve farther into the left atrium during systole.L3,M6,S14,V8

# Residual Pulmonary Hypertension

When important pulmonary hypertension is present preoperatively, it can be expected to regress postoperatively if pulmonary blood flow is large and the patient receives a timely operation, usually when younger than age 6 months.C6,L9

# INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Presence of an AV septal defect indicates need for operation, because an important hemodynamic derangement is nearly always present, and spontaneous closure does not occur.

# Partial Atrioventricular Septal Defects

In partial AV septal defects, pulmonary hypertension is usually absent, and the optimal age for operation is 1 to 2 years, assuming a competent left AV valve. If AV valve regurgitation is present, earlier operation is indicated to prevent further damage to valve tissue. Also, when heart failure or severe growth failure is evident earlier in life, operation is indicated at that time.

# Complete Atrioventricular Septal Defects

Operation is indicated early in the first year of life. When the infant's general condition is good, repair can be delayed until about age 3 to 6 months. When refractory heart failure or severe growth failure is evident at an earlier age, repair at that time is indicated. Often in patients who are older than 1 year, and occasionally in those in the last part of the first year of life, pulmonary vascular disease may already be too severe to permit repair. Criteria of inoperability are the same as described for patients with VSD (see Indications for Operation in Section I of Chapter 35). Lung biopsy is not recommended as an aid in grading severity of pulmonary vascular disease because of its associated morbidity and mortality and because of the scatter between histopathologic findings and pulmonary vascular resistance.

# Coexisting Cardiac Anomalies

Although certain major associated cardiac anomalies increase risk of repair of AV septal defects, their presence rarely alters the indication for operation. Thus, although a coexisting large patent ductus arteriosus has in the past increased risk of repair of complete AV septal defects, it increases the urgency of early repair rather than contraindicating it. When tetralogy of Fallot coexists, indication and timing of repair are similar to that for tetralogy of Fallot in general (see Indications for Operation in Section I of Chapter 38), although some favor elective operation for tetralogy of Fallot with complete AV septal defects at age 9 to 12 months. When complete AV septal defect with juxtaaortic VSD is combined with DORV without pulmonary stenosis, life history and indications for operation are the same as for isolated complete AV septal defect; in the past, risk of repair has been high, but in the current era, early risk has been much less and intermediateterm results good.P2,P3

# SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

# Pulmonary Trunk Banding

Pulmonary trunk banding has been used episodically as initial management for small infants with complete AV septal defects, and some excellent results have been reported.E9 This approach has been used only sparingly in recent years. However, Silverman and colleagues, as well as Williams and colleagues, demonstrated in the early era that some very sick, small infants can be well managed initially by banding and deferral of repair for 6 to 18 months.S5,W8 In the absence of other contraindications to repair (unbalanced ventricles, comorbid conditions), banding is not indicated, because age, left AV valve regurgitation, and many other risk factors have been neutralized, and overall results of complete repair are excellent. In the rare instances in which preliminary pulmonary banding is elected, a device that is adjustable by remote control has provided encouraging results.B19,C14,D5

# Septal Patches

There have been several reports of near-fatal hemolysis from the regurgitant jet of a left AV valve striking a synthetic interatrial patch after repair of AV septal defect.H4,S2,V10 Therefore, for maximal safety, the interatrial patch material should be pericardium.

# Avoiding Heart Block

For years, McGoon and colleagues successfully used a method that involved keeping the suture line on the *left* and *superior sides* of the conduction tissue, rather than on the right side and inferiorly.M7 Starr's group has used the same general method with good results.A3 The patch is sutured to the LSL-LIL complex on the *left* ventricular side of its attachment to the crest of the ventricular septum. Inferiorly, the suture line then goes to the *edge* of the ostium primum defect, posterior and central to the AV node and bundle of His, and posteriorly along the atrial septal edge. This method keeps the suture line to the *left* of, and away from, the AV node and bundle of His (see Fig. 34-25, *E*).

# Unbalanced Atrioventricular Septal Defects

In about 10% of patients with complete AV septal defects, the common AV valve is unequally balanced over the right ventricle or LV. The majority of cases are right dominant with associated LV hypoplasia.M14,S6 The surgical options include biventricular repair or single-ventricle strategies. When one ventricle is severely hypoplastic, a repair resulting in a twoventricle system frequently fails. Theoretically, a Fontan-type repair should be applicable to patients with this type of major associated cardiac anomaly. In the small number of patients treated in this manner, however, hospital mortality has been high.C8,K8 This may be related to very early development of pulmonary vascular disease in patients with complete AV septal defects.

Echocardiographic analyses have been proposed that define the degree of "balance" of the AV valve over each ventricle. Using the subcostal view, the area of the common orifice can be divided into right and left AV valve orifices by a line drawn from the conal septum to the crest of the muscular septum.C11,M14 Cohen and colleaguesC10,C11 (Fig. 34-31) used this method to calculate an AV valve index using the ratio of the left AV valve area divided by the right AV valve area in patients with a larger right AV valve (left/right valve area). In general, patients with a balanced complete AV septal defect have an area ratio greater than 0.67, and a value less than 0.67 indicates right ventricular dominance.

Approximately one third of patients with *right ventricular dominance* have Down syndrome.C11 Patients with Down syndrome frequently have traits that increase the risk of single-ventricle palliations, such as lung hypoplasia, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, hypotonia with hypoventilation, and upper airway obstruction with nocturnal hypercarbia.C1 Additional left-sided anomalies are also common in patients with right-dominant complete AV septal defects. Precise guidelines have not been established for the degree of RV dominance that is consistent with a successful two-ventricle repair. Available analyses are also confounded by the important additional risk imposed by additional major anomalies.C11

(From Mitchell and colleagues.M14)

In data from Cohen and colleagues on patients undergoing two-ventricle repairs with left AV valve/right AV valve ratio between 0.27 and 0.65, the specific ratio failed to predict survivors.C10 Similarly, a study by Van Son and colleaguesV7 examined outcomes with two-ventricle repair among five patients with a diameter ratio (left/right valve diameter) of 0.23 to 0.39. All survived hospitalization, but one died late from left AV valve dysfunction.

Others have examined calculated LV volumes in decision making. Van Son and colleagues suggested that the actual LV volume may be underestimated in right ventricle–dominant AV septal defects secondary to leftward septal bowing, and they introduced the concept of "potential LV volume" to predict the volume of the LV post-repair that could be accomplished with only a change in shape.V7 Patients with a potential volume of 15 mL · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> have survived repair. Individual reports have shown dramatic increases in LV size of twofold to threefold after repair.V11 A small interventricular communication may be a favorable prognostic factor.

Another method of assessing dominance is the ratio of the left AV valve area to the total AV valve area.J1 A ratio of 0.4 or less indicates right ventricular dominance, and a ratio of 0.6 or more indicates LV dominance. In a multicenter study from the Congenital Heart Surgeons Society, a ratio less than 0.2 (severe right ventricular dominance) uniformly predicted a single-ventricle strategy. A valve ratio of 0.4 to 0.6 indicated a "balanced" defect, and a two-ventricle repair was performed. A ratio of 0.2 to 0.4 represented the "gray zone" of moderately severe right ventricular dominance, in which either single- or two-ventricle strategies were applied, with a disproportionately high number of deaths in that range.J1

If biventricular repair is undertaken, placing a left atrial catheter for postoperative monitoring is advisable. A persistently elevated left atrial pressure and signs of low cardiac output, persistent pulmonary edema, or failure to wean from ventilator indicate need for reoperation and conversion to single-ventricle palliation. Unfortunately, outcomes after single-ventricle palliation in this setting are generally worse than for most other single-ventricle cohorts. Owens and colleagues noted a midterm survival of only 50% among 32 patients with severe right-dominant unbalanced AV septal defects, worse than that of a contemporary cohort of hypoplastic left heart syndrome patients.O2 Thirty percent of the unbalanced AV septal defect patients required replacement or repair of their systemic AV valve.

*Left-dominant unbalanced complete AV septal defect* may be defined by a right AV valve area/left AV valve area less than 0.5 or a left AV valve area/total valve area greater than 0.6. Down syndrome has been reported in 80% of this subset.D4 When the valve ratio is less than 0.5, risk of biventricular repair may carry an increased risk. De Oliveira and colleagues reported improved outcomes with a restrictive atrial fenestration intended to lower right atrial pressure and increase cardiac output with some degree of desaturation.D4 The general surgical strategies in this patient group are similar to those for pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (see Chapter 40). When right ventricular hypoplasia is severe and success of biventricular repair is in question, a "one-anda-half ventricle repair," as suggested by Alvarado and colleagues and others, may be appropriate.A8,V1 In this repair, the usual procedure to correct the AV septal defect is accompanied by a bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis. Pulmonary blood flow is augmented, and the right ventricle is unloaded. A potential but unusual problem is pulmonary artery–to–right atrial circular flow if superior vena cava–to– right atrium continuity is maintained.

### Late Reoperation

The only residual condition that remains an important cause of late reoperation is left AV valve regurgitation. Najm and colleagues reported that 9.4% of 363 patients operated on for complete AV septal defect underwent subsequent repair or replacement of the left AV valve; 3 of 34 (8.8%; CL 3.9%-17%) patients died.N1 Intraoperative echocardiography reduces the occurrence of residual important left AV valve regurgitation. The report of Reddy and colleagues is illustrativeR7: 72 infants (median age 3 to 9 months) underwent repair of complete AV septal defect, and cleft closure or anuloplasty was done in 70. Based on TEE, 10 were returned to CPB for revision of the left AV valve. Among all 72 patients, there was 1 early death. There were 5 late reoperations with a median follow-up of 24 months; 2 were for AV valve regurgitation and 3 for subaortic obstruction. Although there may have been mild deterioration of AV valve function in patients with mild to moderate regurgitation early postoperatively, there was a 90% probability of not having severe late AV valve regurgitation at a mean follow-up of 45 months (range 3 to 169 months).R8
