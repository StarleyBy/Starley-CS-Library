## DEFINITION

This chapter discusses regurgitation and stenosis of the tricuspid valve in those uncommon situations in which it occurs as an isolated lesion, as well as tricuspid valve disease associated with mitral or combined mitral and aortic valve disease. Mitral valve surgery with coexisting tricuspid valve disease is also discussed in Chapter 11.

Tricuspid valve abnormalities or disease may be associated with various conditions discussed in other chapters, including atrioventricular septal defect (Chapter 34), ventricular septal defect with straddling tricuspid valve (Chapter 35), pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum (Chapter 40), Ebstein anomaly (Chapter 42), and right atrial myxoma (Chapter 18). Rarely, isolated tricuspid valve disease is secondary to chronic cor pulmonale,K5,K6 inferior myocardial infarction,M3,Z2 administration of methysergide,B2,M10 scleroderma,S1 lupus erythematosus,G2 primary phospholipid syndrome,H2 and hypereosinophilic syndrome.C7,S14,V2

# MORPHOLOGY

#### Functional (Secondary) Tricuspid Regurgitation

The multitude of chordal attachments of the tricuspid valve, described in Chapter 1, may impair proper leaflet coaptation and promote tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in the presence of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and dilatation.S8 The tricuspid anulus shortens during systole when the tricuspid valve is competent.T4,T6 When right ventricular (RV) dilatation develops, usually as a consequence of important disease of the left-sided heart valves in association with pulmonary arterial hypertension, the tricuspid anulus also dilates (lengthens) and fails to shorten during systole.U1 The leaflets and chordae remain normal in appearance.W1 The septal leaflet portion of the anulus lengthens least in this process, because it is fixed between the right and left trigones and the atrial and ventricular septa. As the RV free wall dilates, the remaining two thirds of the anulus lengthens, particularly that part giving

**Figure 14-1** Dilatation of the tricuspid valve anulus, indicated by a sequence of overlaid annulae. Tricuspid anular dilatation due to increased right ventricular and pulmonary artery pressures secondary to left-sided heart valve disease occurs predominantly in the septal-lateral direction, as indicated by arrows.

![](_page_1_Figure_4.jpeg)

**Figure 14-2** Correlation between tricuspid anulus diameter (TAD) and tricuspid regurgitant volume (VTR) in patients with valvar heart disease *(open circles)* and those with atrial septal defect *(closed circles)*. Correlation with the former is .87 and with the latter, .88. Correlation lines cross the horizontal axis at a tricuspid anulus diameter of 33 to 34 mm, which is the threshold for tricuspid regurgitation in adult patients.

origin to the posterior leaflet (Fig. 14-1).B7,C9,T4 The anular dilatation results in failure of leaflet coaptation, contributed to in some patients by chordal shortening secondary to the RV dilatation.S2 Thus, a strong correlation exists between tricuspid anular diameter measured echocardiographically and presence and severity of TR (Fig. 14-2). As the tricuspid anulus dilates, it assumes a more circular shape in a flat plane.R6 The reported threshold for TR based on anular dilatation is 27 mm · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> or about 34 mm in the average adult.S19

The degree of TR is also importantly influenced by RV preload, afterload, and systolic function, because the tricuspid anulus is very dynamic, with a 15% to 20% reduction in circumference during atrial systole.F2,F3,R6

Experimental work by Tsakiris and colleagues has shown that perfect systolic tricuspid leaflet closure depends on proper systolic shortening in the circumference of the tricuspid anulus.T6,T7 In support of this finding, Simon and colleagues have demonstrated a considerable increase in systolic shortening postoperatively in patients whose TR lessens after mitral valve surgery and no change in those in whom it persists or worsens.S9 In addition, an increased diastolic diameter of the tricuspid anulus results in TR; diastolic diameter is increased by pulmonary artery hypertension, RV myocardial failure, and increased diastolic volume secondary to left-sided heart pathology.

The pathogenesis of functional TR in mitral valve disease is summarized in Fig. 14-3. The final common pathway is RV dysfunction and dilatation and tricuspid anular dilation. The process becomes self-propagating, because worsening TR exacerbates RV volume overload with further RV dysfunction and enlargement. In addition, because of ventricular interdependence, worsening RV dysfunction increases interventricular shift toward the left, causing restricted left ventricular filling, further elevation of left atrial pressure, pulmonary hypertension, and greater RV afterload, which further affects the RV.

It is these mechanisms that may produce TR late after isolated mitral valve operations or after combined aortic and mitral valve operations (see Chapters 11 and 13).

# Rheumatic Tricuspid Stenosis and Regurgitation

Rheumatic tricuspid valve disease occurs in association with rheumatic involvement of the mitral valve, the mitral and aortic valves combined, or rarely, the aortic valve alone. It is not seen as an isolated lesion.

Rheumatic tricuspid disease usually results in a regurgitant valve with variable amounts of stenosis, but in rare cases there may be pure stenosis.Y1 In tricuspid stenosis, the orifice is larger than in mitral stenosis, even when hemodynamically there is severe obstruction. Therefore, the hemodynamic effects of anatomically moderate tricuspid stenosis are the equivalent of tight mitral stenosis. A mean diastolic gradient of even 4 to 5 mmHg across the tricuspid valve indicates important stenosis. Borders of the stenotic tricuspid orifice are usually fibrous and thickened, although peripheral portions of the leaflets remain thin.C3

The hallmark of organic tricuspid stenosis is commissural fusion. All commissures are usually equally fused, but occasionally fusion is limited to the anteroseptal commissure. Chordal thickening and fusion are usually mild, and calcification is usually absent.

# Tricuspid Valve Endocarditis

Acute tricuspid valve endocarditis is rare and usually associated with habitual intravenous self-administration of drugs.A7 The most common etiologic organism is *Pseudomonas aeruginosa,* followed by *Staphylococcus aureus*. S17 A variety of gram-negative bacilli may be involved. Rarely, *Candida albicans* is the infective organism. The organisms may form masses on the valve leaflets, or simply erode and destroy large portions of leaflets and chordae (see Chapter 15).

## Traumatic Injury of Tricuspid Valve

TR is an uncommon result of severe, nonpenetrating chest injury, and in this setting is due to rupture of one or more papillary muscles or chordae (see "Atrioventricular Valve Rupture" in Section II of Chapter 17).K2 Usually it is the anterior tricuspid leaflet that becomes flailed. Rarely, the ventricular septum may rupture.S16 Occasionally a transvenous ventricular pacing lead is associated with important TR. This may be due to perforation, laceration, or scarring.P1 Apical electric activation may also contribute. Rarely, pacemaker leads can cause tricuspid stenosis secondary to leaflet scarring and adhesions.T2 Similar scarring of the septal and posterior leaflets following cryothermic or radiofrequency ablative procedures rarely can produce severe tricuspid regurgitation. Following cardiac transplantation, many years of repeated transvenous endomyocardial biopsies may induce severe TR secondary to inadvertent severing of chordae during biopsy.

## Carcinoid Tricuspid Valve Disease

Carcinoid tumors originate from Kulchitsky cells in the gastrointestinal tract, which produce serotonin (5hydroxytryptamine), a substance inactivated in the liver. However, carcinoid tumors that metastasize to the liver produce serotonin there, and this powerful substance passes into the pulmonary and, to a lesser extent, systemic circulation (because a good deal of it is inactivated in the lungs). Thereby, the carcinoid syndrome may be produced, with bronchospasm, diarrhea, nausea, malabsorption, flushing, and telangiectasia. In some of these patients, cicatricial deformity of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves also develops (see "Carcinoid Heart Disease" in Chapter 18).

Typical carcinoid symptoms are considerably more common in carcinoid patients with valvar involvement than in noncardiac carcinoid patients.R5 Tricuspid commissures are fused, chordae tendineae thickened and fused, and leaflets thickened and shortened,C2 resulting in combined stenosis and regurgitation. Microscopically, a deposition of loose or compact fibrous tissue is present on both surfaces of the tricuspid leaflets. The white fibrous plaques, if present on the ventricular side of the leaflets, promote adherence of the leaflet to the underlying ventricular myocardium, preventing appropriate leaflet coaptation.

TR is the most common cardiac manifestation of the carcinoid syndrome. Tricuspid valve replacement may be required, but operative mortality is high as a result of comorbidity, particularly in patients above the age of 60.H1,H3,R4

# CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

Tricuspid valve disease affects approximately 0.8% of the U.S. population,S11,S18 with about 2.4% having mitral valve prolapse. About 8000 persons per year undergo tricuspid valve surgery in the United States.C4

# Tricuspid Stenosis

Moderate degrees of tricuspid stenosis may be overlooked, particularly if the patient is in atrial fibrillation. If sinus rhythm is present, there is a dominant *a* wave in the jugular venous pulse (immediately preceding the carotid pulse). Other signs include a mid-diastolic, often high-pitched murmur maximal over the lower left sternal edge, which increases on inspiration; there may be a tricuspid opening snap. The murmur can be confused with an aortic early diastolic murmur (because its timing may be relatively early) or with a conducted mitral diastolic murmur. The liver is enlarged but not pulsatile (unless from forceful atrial contraction that produces a presystolic pulse).

The chest radiograph shows right atrial enlargement, and the electrocardiogram shows a prominent P wave unless atrial fibrillation is present. Two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography is helpful in establishing the presence of leaflet thickening. Cardiac catheterization with simultaneous measurement of right atrial and RV pressures identifies a diastolic gradient (>4 mm) across the valve.

## Tricuspid Regurgitation

History and physical signs are sufficient to suggest diagnosis of important TR. The jugular venous pulse shows a dominant fused *c* and *v* wave, followed by a sharp, deep *y* descent. The murmur, maximal over the lower left sternal edge, is pansystolic, is often high pitched, and increases on inspiration. The enlarged liver shows systolic pulsation. However, when TR is severe, such as after excision of the tricuspid valve, a murmur may be absent.F1 In advanced cases, there are other signs of right heart failure, including peripheral edema and ascites. Mitral or aortic valve disease signs can dominate the findings, and severe right heart failure may occur under such conditions without TR.

The symptomatic state of severe TR is generally manifested by progressive fatigue and weakness, related to reduction in cardiac output and the unpleasant sensation of ascites, congestive hepatosplenomegaly, and peripheral edema. The symptomatic state of right heart failure and volume overload can be palliated with aggressive diuretic therapy, but in the chronic stages, symptoms become refractory. In late stages, cachexia and jaundice may complicate the clinical complex.

Quantification of the degree of TR is important when surgical treatment of valvar heart disease is being considered, but preoperative assessment is often difficult because of the confounding effect of severe cardiac failure. In this regard, *2D echocardiography* is particularly useful, because presence of the cardiac catheter across the tricuspid valve interferes with angiographic assessment. Both contrast and Doppler echocardiography have been useful, but the increasing precision of color flow mapping and Doppler color flow mapguided interrogation have made them the favored methods for estimating tricuspid regurgitant flow.C6,C12 The vena contracta, as determined by color flow Doppler, indirectly reflects effective regurgitant orifice area, which if greater than 0.7 cm indicates severe TR.B9,Z1 Quantitative assessment of TR can also be accomplished with the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) method.B11 Dilatation of the inferior vena cava and flow reversal in the inferior vena caval and hepatic veins provide supporting evidence. Echocardiography can also detect paradoxical ventricular septal motion and shift of the atrial septum toward the left atrium in isolated TR. Maximum circumference of the tricuspid anulus is larger in patients with TR than in normal adults (14 ± 0.7 cm and 11.9 ± 0.9 cm, respectively), and its reduction during systole is less (10% ± 2% vs. 19% ± 4%).C6,T4

Despite these refinements in diagnosis, the presence and severity of TR need to be assessed in the operating room. The patient's hemodynamic state must be optimized by the anesthesiologist for any form of assessment to have validity. The surgeon's finger, inserted through the right atrial appendage, can appreciate a TR jet. Severe TR correlates reasonably well with a jet of greater intensity, greater width, and increased propagation from the valve orifice. If TR is severe, however, there may not be a jet with sufficient velocity to be identified in this manner.G3 In the current era, rigorous assessment of TR and tricuspid anular circumference by transesophageal echocardiography in the operating room has largely supplanted finger palpation.C6,C13, G3

In the special setting of *tricuspid valve endocarditis in drug addicts,* the valve is usually rapidly destroyed, and classic signs and symptoms of severe TR develop. The illness is usually only 1 to 3 weeks in duration before the patient presents for medical care. Frequently, pulmonary symptoms and signs secondary to septic pulmonary emboli are marked.R2 The diagnosis can be strongly suspected from a history of drug abuse, evidence of pulmonary infection, elevated jugular venous pressure, pulsatile neck veins, and pulsatile liver. These features, combined with positive blood cultures (in samples withdrawn from the RV or pulmonary artery) and echocardiography, are usually sufficient to establish the diagnosis.K8

Diagnosis of traumatic TR is usually easily established by signs of severe TR and a history of a blow to the chest (see Chapter 17). Occasionally, however, the relationship of these signs to a history of injury is not obvious. In patients with traumatic TR, right-to-left shunting may occur across a patent foramen ovale, which can lead to the mistaken diagnosis of Ebstein anomaly.

## NATURAL HISTORY

The natural history of patients with dominantly *stenotic tricuspid valve disease* is usually determined primarily by the associated rheumatic mitral or aortic valve disease. No doubt, however, the increased systemic venous pressure,

**Figure 14-4** Natural history after occurrence of tricuspid regurgitation caused by flail leaflets in patients without associated diseases contributing to symptoms (Sx). Kaplan-Meier curves depict occurrence of new atrial fibrillation (AF; 2.8% yearly), New York Heart Association functional class III or IV symptoms, or heart failure (HF) (Sx or HF; 4.4% yearly) and the composite end point of first occurrence of symptoms or heart failure, new AF, tricuspid surgery, or death (6.5% yearly). (From Bruce and Connolly.B11)

hepatomegaly, and peripheral edema accelerate deterioration of patients with rheumatic tricuspid stenosis.

*Primary TR* has an inherent tendency to progress, just as do other types of valvar regurgitation. However, the deleterious effects of ventricular volume overload on the right side of the heart are slower to develop than on the left. For example, in patients with traumatic TR who survive the initial trauma, regurgitation may be well tolerated for many months or years.B5,M2 Ultimately, however, symptoms develop as regurgitation increases; by 5 to 10 years after trauma, they are usually severe and incapacitating. In patients with acute tricuspid endocarditis caused by *S. aureus,* tricuspid vegetations greater than 1 cm in diameter (visualized by 2D echocardiography) worsen the natural history of TR.B4 In a study of 60 patients with severe TR secondary to trauma, myxomatous change, or endocarditis, those who did not undergo operation had an increased risk of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and death (Fig. 14-4).

*Functional (secondary) TR* of severe degree is present in about 30% of patients with severe mitral regurgitation. If not surgically treated, the TR tends to progress, even after adequate treatment of the left-sided valvar lesion.T1 The tendency for progression of TR related to anular size and other risk factors is also discussed in Chapter 11.

There is now increasing awareness of the potential deleterious effects of even moderate TR if left uncorrected at the first operation for mitral valve disease, especially if the tricuspid anulus is dilated. King and colleagues reported that 66% of patients returning for tricuspid valve procedures late after mitral valve replacement had only mild TR at the time of the initial valve operation.K7 In this regard, preoperative echocardiography at initial operation is advisable to detect not only morphology and severity of TR, but also tricuspid anular size. Once the anulus dilates, its diameter does not spontaneously normalize. Typically, tricuspid anular dilatation is a progressive process that eventually leads to severe TR. The importance of a dilated tricuspid anulus in the genesis of severe TR is underscored by the study of Dreyfus and colleagues; they reported a dramatic reduction in late progression of TR by routinely performing tricuspid anuloplasty during surgery for left-sided valve lesions if the tricuspid anulus was greater than twice normal size. <sup>D3</sup> Thus, preoperative tricuspid anular dilatation is a predictor of late TR.

Among patients with heart failure, approximately one third have moderate or severe TR, which is a predictor of reduced long-term survival (hazard ratio 1.3), and even more so when pulmonary hypertension is present. C4,K1,K9,N5

## **TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION**

# Tricuspid Valve Anuloplasty

# Anuloplasty Ring Technique

Because isolated tricuspid valve disease is rare, the technique of operation is given for TR accompanying left-sided valve disease. When evaluation before cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) indicates important TR, two venous cannulae are used. The tricuspid procedure may be performed in the beating, perfused heart during rewarming of the patient, with suction on the aortic vent needle after the left heart has been carefully de-aired, or during continuing antegrade/retrograde cold cardioplegia with addition of external cardiac cooling.

After the mitral procedure is completed, the right atrium is opened with the usual oblique incision (Fig. 14-5). When an anuloplasty is performed using a ring, length of the base of the tricuspid septal leaflet is measured with calipers, or area of the anterior leaflet with a sizer, and on this basis the proper-sized ring is selected. <sup>C3</sup> The Carpentier-Edwards anuloplasty ring, for example, is a modified oval corresponding to configuration of the tricuspid anulus, with a gap in the portion designed to overlie the atrioventricular (AV) node so that the conduction tissue is not compromised. <sup>B8</sup> Rings correct TR by returning the anulus to slightly less than its

normal size by plicating that portion at the base of the posterior (posteroinferior) leaflet and at the commissure between that and the anterior leaflet. Thus, the ring effectively "bicuspidizes" the tricuspid valve. The anulus is not plicated at either the attachment of the septal leaflet or along the major part of the attachment of the large anterior leaflet. A flexible "half ring" (Cosgrove) accomplishes a similar function, leaving the base of the septal leaflet untouched but plicating the anulus at the attachment of the anterior and posterior leaflets. The size of the ring is determined by length of the septal leaflet (intertrigonal distance). M4 It is unwise to select too small a ring in the belief that it will be more effective, because it distorts and narrows the orifice and may subsequently detach. Because tissues around the tricuspid valve are usually tenuous, sutures must take adequate bites, beginning in the atrial wall and passing into the deeper part of the anulus itself, carefully avoiding leaflet tissue. The surgeon must also be cognizant of the location and course of the right coronary artery, as its inadvertent suture ligation has been reported. C1

After discontinuing CPB and before decannulation, competence of the valve is assessed by 2D echocardiography, using either a handheld or esophageal probe. Presence of moderate or severe TR is an indication for valve replacement or repair. If the heart is beating and normothermic, a reasonable assessment of competence of the repair is possible as soon as it is completed. With the atrium still open, the RV is allowed to fill with blood, and the tricuspid leaflet apposition is assessed. If apposition is obviously inadequate, the valve is replaced or repaired. If it appears adequate, the right atrium is closed, air is aspirated from the RV and pulmonary artery, and the operation is completed in the usual manner (see "Completing Operation" in Section III of Chapter 2).

Figure 14-5 Tricuspid ring anuloplasty. **A**, Exposure is through the usual oblique right atriotomy. Venous cannulae are inserted directly into superior and inferior venae cavae (for alternatives, see Chapter 2). **B**, Stay sutures provide excellent exposure (alternatively, a Cooley retractor may be used). The surgeon identifies anteroseptal tricuspid valve commissure, membranous part of atrioventricular septum, and coronary sinus orifice and can then mentally visualize location of the atrioventricular (AV) node and penetrating portion of the bundle of His. Using appropriate sizers, notched at points corresponding to the anteroseptal and posteroseptal commissures at both ends of the septal tricuspid leaflet, a proper-sized tricuspid anuloplasty ring is selected.

![](_page_5_Picture_2.jpeg)

**C,** The first stitch, of No. 2-0 or 3-0 polyester, is positioned exactly at the midpoint of the septal leaflet anulus, and only two further mattress stitches are needed for the septal portion of the ring. Small pledgets may be used on these mattress sutures. These and all other sutures are passed first through host tissue and then through the cloth of the undersurface of the ring, just as in suturing the ring for mitral anuloplasty (see Chapter 11). **D,** Five or six mattress stitches are needed in the portion of the anulus to be plicated, which is adjacent to the posterior leaflet, and these are passed through the cloth of the ring close together (marking stitches are present on the ring cloth to guide the surgeon). The remainder of the ring, corresponding to about half its circumference, is attached to the anulus at the base of the anterior cusp with, at most, four fairly widely spaced mattress sutures. The ring is lowered into position along the sutures and the sutures tied, with great care taken not to pull upward strongly on them, lest they tear out. In some cases the anuloplasty ring can be secured in place with three or four interrupted mattress sutures along the septal leaflet and then with continuous sutures for the remainder. **Figure 14-5, cont'd**

## *Bicuspidization Technique*

An alternative technique is to shorten the circumference of the tricuspid anulus by simply excluding that part to which the posterior leaflet is attached.B10,K3,K4,N4 To accomplish this, a No. 2-0 or 3-0 polyester suture is passed through the anulus at the anteroposterior commissure, then at the center of the posterior leaflet, and then through the anulus at the posteroseptal commissure. The suture is tied snugly, and a second one is placed for reinforcement. Pledgeted mattress sutures also may be used. A further modification that incorporates a flexible strip into the posterior leaflet anuloplasty has been reported to be useful.B7 The repaired tricuspid valve should have about a normal diameter (see "Dimensions of Normal Cardiac and Great Artery Pathways" in Chapter 1.)

# *De Vega Technique*

The De Vega technique is used in patients with no more than moderate TR from anular dilatation, where it is anticipated that good long-term function is not dependent on integrity of the repair.D1 This technique has the advantages of simplicity and low cost. A No. 2-0 polyester suture (not monofilament polypropylene) is passed in a counterclockwise direction as a circular stitch deeply into the junction of the anulus and right ventricular wall from 1 or 2 cm medial to the posteroseptal commissure to the base of the anterior leaflet 2 to 4 cm medial to the anteroseptal commissure (Fig. 14-6). The same suture is then reversed and passed in clockwise direction slightly peripherally to the first stitch back to the starting point. Separate pledgets of polyester felt are incorporated in the suture at each end to prevent its pulling through the tissues. The suture is tightened until the orifice will admit an appropriate sizer (24 to 30 mm) and is then tied.

## *Other Supplemental Techniques*

Many of the techniques of mitral valve reconstruction have been applied to repair of TR, particularly in the setting of congenital heart disease. Partial or complete closure of accessory commissures, implanting artificial chordae, Alfieri edgeto-edge technique,C11 and pericardial leaflet augmentationD4 have all been described.

#### Tricuspid Valve Replacement

When tricuspid valve replacement is elected, the leaflets are excised, and a 2- to 3-mm fringe of leaflet tissue is left on the anulus (Fig. 14-7). Alternatively, the septal leaflet may be left in situ. Interrupted pledgeted mattress sutures are placed in the fringe of leaflet tissue along the area occupied by the

![](_page_6_Picture_2.jpeg)

septal leaflet, to avoid damaging the AV node and bundle of His. Either a continuous polypropylene suture or interrupted pledgeted mattress sutures may be used for the remainder of the insertion. Alternatively, simple interrupted sutures may be used throughout. Infrequently, to avoid heart block, the suture line for valve insertion can be placed on the atrial aspect above the coronary sinus and base of the septal defect.

#### Tricuspid Valve Excision

In drug addicts with active tricuspid valve endocarditis, the three leaflets and their chordae tendineae can simply be excised, using the general techniques described earlier.A8,A9,M9,S4,W3 However, postoperative convalescence and late cardiac performance are compromised by the resulting severe TR. In addition, later valve replacement is more difficult.

Stern and colleagues suggest that primary bioprosthetic valve replacement is preferable to valve excision and is not followed by recurrent endocarditis unless intravenous drug abuse continues.S17

# Partial Tricuspid Valve Replacement with Cryopreserved Tricuspid Valve Allograft

Partial replacement of the tricuspid valve with a cryopreserved allograft is an attractive option for severe TR caused by endocarditis, because allografts are known to demonstrate greater freedom from reinfection compared with xenografts or mechanical valves in the aortic position (see Chapter 15). Shrestha and colleagues from Brisbane, Australia, reported favorable outcomes in 13 patients (three late reoperations) using tricuspid valve allografts for tricuspid endocarditis.S6

# SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Long-term anticoagulation is needed when a mechanical valve has been used or if there is an additional mechanical prosthesis in either the mitral or aortic position. Warfarin

**Figure 14-7** Tricuspid valve replacement. **A,** Exposure is as for repair. All three leaflets of the tricuspid valve are excised, leaving a cuff at the base of the septal leaflet 5 to 8 mm wide. Alternatively, the septal leaflet may be left in situ. **B,** Starting at the midpoint of the septal leaflet cuff, interrupted horizontal mattress sutures buttressed with felt pledgets are placed first into remaining valve tissue and then through the sewing ring of the replacement device. **C,** After placing four to five interrupted mattress sutures, remainder of the insertion is completed using a continuous suture technique. Bites may be through the anulus, mindful that the right coronary artery lies deep to the anulus anteriorly. Alternatively, interrupted sutures can be used circumferentially. Key: *AV,* Atrioventricular.

administration is begun on the evening of postoperative day 1 (see "Special Features of Postoperative Care" in Chapter 11). If a bioprosthesis is used and has also been used for all other valves replaced, long-term anticoagulation is controversial.

Because of the risk of complete heart block in the latter part of the hospital stay, electrocardiographic monitoring should be continued until a stable rhythm is established at an adequate heart rate.

Fluid retention is prominent among patients with tricuspid valve disease. Characteristically, their postoperative care requires aggressive use of diuretic agents.

## RESULTS

# Tricuspid Valve Anuloplasty

# *Symptom Relief*

Assessing the clinical benefit of tricuspid anuloplasty in the setting of concomitant mitral valve surgery is confounded by the favorable impact of relieving mitral valve stenosis or regurgitation. The symptomatic benefit can be more directly evaluated in patients undergoing isolated tricuspid valve surgery. In a study of 60 patients with flail tricuspid valve leaflets, symptomatic improvement occurred in 88% of those who underwent tricuspid valve repair or replacement.M8

# *Survival*

Because tricuspid anuloplasty is rarely performed as an isolated procedure, its effect on early and late survival is difficult to assess directly. In patients with isolated TR from trauma or endocarditis, reported surgical mortality is low.M8 In combined operations including tricuspid anuloplasty, early mortality can be similar to that of operations in which tricuspid anuloplasty was not required.B1 However, end-organ damage from long-standing right heart failure increases the risk of operation. When right heart failure is severe enough to cause liver damage, the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score has been applied as a predictive model for operative mortality in combined procedures that include tricuspid anuloplasty.A4 By multivariable analysis, a MELD score of 15 or greater was strongly predictive of increased mortality (hospital mortality of 19% with MELD score of ≥15 vs. 6% with score <15). Intermediateterm survival may be compromised by persistence of important RV dysfunction that often accompanies severe TR (see "Mitral Valve Surgery with Coexisting Tricuspid Valve Disease" in Chapter 11). An analysis by Singh and colleaguesS12 indicates that anuloplasty is an independent predictor of better 10-year survival compared with tricuspid valve replacement for organic disease.

## *Tricuspid Valve Competence*

Anuloplasty of the tricuspid valve results in valvar competence in most patients. Freedom from moderate or severe recurrent TR in 98 patients receiving anuloplasty (mostly Carpentier rings) was 85% at 6 years.B1 Carpentier and colleagues found that with use of the Carpentier ring, mild or less TR was present late postoperatively in more than 90% of patients with preoperative moderate or severe regurgitation.C3 Longterm relief of TR by use of anuloplasty rings has been confirmed by postoperative 2D echocardiography with Doppler color flow mapping.C13

Kay and colleagues have also reported satisfactory results in a sizable group of patients after suture bicuspidization anuloplasty.K4,N4 Experience with the De Vega anuloplasty has also provided good results, confirmed in larger series by echocardiography.A1,K10,P2

However, there are established risk factors for persisting TR after repair. Recurrence is more likely when mitral disease progresses or severe pulmonary hypertension persistsB1 (see "Mitral Valve Surgery with Coexisting Tricuspid Valve Disease" in Chapter 11). Duran and colleagues found that when functional TR was repaired, 31 of 35 patients (89%; CL 80%-94%) with low late postoperative pulmonary vascular resistance (<6 units · m2 ) had no regurgitation, whereas this was true of only 6 of 14 patients (43%; CL 27%-60%) with high pulmonary vascular resistance (*P* = .001).D2

Tethering of the tricuspid valve leaflets is a risk factor for early recurrent TR, and depressed right or left ventricular function predict later TR recurrence.F2,F3 Other factors increasing the risk of late TR recurrence include higher preoperative TR grade, depressed left ventricular function, and permanent pacing leads through the tricuspid valve. In a study of pacemaker leads remaining across the tricuspid valve following anuloplasty repair, 42% of patients had severe TR at 5 years, twice the prevalence of those without such leads.L1,M12 The relationship between anuloplasty technique and outcome is discussed in text that follows (see Indications for Operation, "Selection of Anuloplasty Technique and Choice of Device").

## *Reoperation*

Reoperation for tricuspid valve dysfunction is infrequent following Carpentier ring anuloplasty, with 97% of this group being free of reoperation 3 years postoperatively.B1 Nakano and colleagues reported that after suture anuloplasty for important functional tricuspid regurgitation, 94% of patients were free of reoperation 10 years later, as were 70% 17 years later.N4 Usually, redeveloped TR is associated with persisting or developed pulmonary hypertension. Because persisting severe TR appears to be a marker for underlying advanced myocardial and valvar heart disease, reoperations for recurrent TR are generally high-risk procedures, with hospital mortality of up to 35%.T2

# *Functional Status*

Functional status as assessed by New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class is usually improved by tricuspid anuloplasty.B1

# Tricuspid Valve Replacement

#### *Survival*

Early mortality for tricuspid valve replacement with or without double or triple valve surgery is currently about 2% to 10%,A3,S20 less than in earlier years (see "Risk Factors for Premature Death after Tricuspid Valve Surgery" later in this chapter); however, mortality may exceed 25% in patients in NYHA class III or IV, those having repeat operations, or those with complex congenital heart disease.S3 Of importance, a propensity analysis indicated no important differences in early and late survival among patients undergoing tricuspid valve repair versus replacement.M11 Thus, the surgeon should not hesitate to consider valve replacement when anatomic substrate is suboptimal for repair. No survival difference has been demonstrated between mechanical and bioprosthetic tricuspid valves.R1,R3

Survival at 10 years is approximately 55% to 60%, including hospital deaths. Most of these patients have multivalvar disease, and tricuspid valve failure is seldom the dominant factor in late death.B1,G1 Predictors of late mortality after tricuspid valve replacement include older age at operation, poor left or right ventricular function, endocarditis, preoperative stroke or renal failure, and concomitant mitral valve surgery.T3

# *Mode of Premature Late Death*

Following tricuspid valve surgery, most late deaths are related to advanced RV dysfunction or arrhythmias. Endocarditis and stroke are uncommon modes of death, as are recurrent moderate or severe tricuspid stenosis or regurgitation resulting from malfunction of the replacement devices or failed anuloplasty. Thus, among 284 patients followed over nearly 10 years (combined GLH-UAB), prevalence of these complications was similar after either tricuspid valve repair or replacement and accounted for 9 (11%; CL 8%-16%) of the late deaths, or 3.2% of the entire group (CL 2%-5%).

## *Complete Heart Block*

Complete heart block occasionally develops late after tricuspid valve replacement, usually with associated mitral valve replacement.B1 This association is undoubtedly related to the position of the AV node between the two replacement devices. In all, approximately 10% of patients undergoing both tricuspid and mitral valve replacement require insertion of a pacemaker late postoperatively because of heart block, and up to 10 years postoperatively the prevalence is 25%. Late heart block is rare among patients undergoing tricuspid valve replacement as an isolated procedure. Late development of complete heart block is also uncommon after tricuspid anuloplasty.B1

## *Thromboembolism*

Pulmonary embolization is a rare complication of tricuspid valve surgery. Only 1 of 103 patients had probable large pulmonary emboli on follow-up (UAB), and the origin of that embolus was uncertain.

# *Thrombosis*

After tricuspid valve replacement, thrombosis may occur, more often of mechanical devices than of bioprostheses. The older types of mechanical prostheses (Smelloff-Cutter, Bjork-Shiley) apparently had a greater risk than present bileaflet valves.K1,P3 The linearized thrombosis rate in Van Nooten's series of 146 tricuspid replacements was approximately 1% per patient-year.V1

In an Italian study of 43 patients undergoing tricuspid valve replacement with a variety of mechanical prostheses, actuarial freedom from valve thrombosis was greater than 80% at 10 years.G1 Initial thrombolytic treatment using streptokinase may relieve obstruction in many cases. Hurrell and colleagues have reviewed the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy for all valve positions, and this approach seems particularly effective for prostheses in the tricuspid position (Table 14-1).H4 Currently, thrombolysis is considered the first line of therapy for tricuspid valve thrombosis, in contrast to

Streptokinase is administered as in treatment of acute myocardial infarction: 1 million units over 45 to 60 minutes optionally followed by 150,000 units · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> for 4 to 6 hours. Alternatively, urokinase may be infused intravenously at 50,000 to 150,000 units · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> for up to 24 hours.

Allergy to streptokinase is manifested by hypotension and fever. An unusual reaction to urokinase is severe rigor.

#### *Functional Status*

Late functional status of patients undergoing tricuspid valve surgery is influenced more by the multivalvar nature of most of the procedures than by the tricuspid repair or replacement itself. Nonetheless, most patients are considerably improved by the surgical procedure. Thus, in the GLH-UAB follow-up group, 42% of 103 patients were in NYHA class I late postoperatively. This is more impressive when it is realized that of these, 34 were preoperatively in class V,1 62 in class IV, and 6 in class III. In both series, less than 15% were in class IV late postoperatively.

## *Symptoms of Systemic Venous Hypertension*

Most patients remain free of systemic venous hypertension late postoperatively. However, peripheral edema and hepatomegaly, with or without ascites, are common at follow-up. These symptoms could be the result of functional or organic obstruction of the tricuspid replacement device, residual left-sided cardiac failure with or without left-sided valvar disease, or important residual pulmonary hypertension (high pulmonary vascular resistance) or residual RV dysfunction. In this regard, Silver and colleagues reported higher right atrial pressures after tricuspid valve replacement than before in patients with Ebstein anomaly, but they also noted marked symptomatic improvement in cardiac function.S7

Class V is cardiogenic shock or hemodynamic instability requiring emergency operation. This class augments the usual NYHA class IV, based on the observation of the UAB group that this subgroup of class IV was generally at higher risk than patients simply confined to bed. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Cardiac Database classifies this as emergency salvage.

Key: *SD,* Standard deviation.

## *Performance of Replacement Devices*

Both porcine and pericardial bioprostheses have performed well in the tricuspid position.N3 Small gradients of 4 to 10 mmHg exist across *stent-mounted xenografts* in the tricuspid position (Table 14-2). In general, however, prostheses with an internal diameter of at least 27 mm do not exhibit clinically important gradients. Bioprosthetic valves seem to degenerate at about the same rate and with the same agerelated occurrence in the tricuspid position as they do in the mitral and aortic positions (see "Reoperation" under Mitral Valve Replacement and Results in Section I of Chapter 11; see also "Central Leakage" under Replacement Device Regurgitation in Chapter 12), although studies by Cohen and colleaguesC8 and Ohata and colleaguesO1 suggest that freedom from degeneration may be somewhat greater in the tricuspid position than in the mitral position. Although Nakano reported 100% freedom from structural degeneration at 9 years, pannus formation on the ventricular side of the cusps was a frequent finding by echocardiographic analysis in patients with at least 5 years of follow-up.N2

The Starr-Edwards ball valve *mechanical prosthesis* and the Bjork-Shiley mechanical prosthesis have performed well in the tricuspid position.W2 The St. Jude Medical valve (and other bileaflet valves) appears also to exhibit good hemodynamic performance in the tricuspid position; Singh and colleagues reported diastolic gradients of 2 mmHg or less in seven patients.S10

## *Reoperation*

Most patients who have undergone tricuspid valve replacement are free of reoperation up to 10 years later. Of those receiving mechanical or xenograft valves at UAB, 96% were free from tricuspid reoperation at 5 years, and 89% at 9 years. In McGrath's series of 530 patients having a procedure involving the tricuspid valve, freedom from reoperation was 26% at 15 years.M7 However, because of the competing risk of 81 late deaths, cumulative incidence of reoperation was 59% at 15 years (see "Competing Risks" under Time-Related Events in Chapter 6).M7

## Tricuspid Valve Excision

# *Survival*

An early mortality of 12% was reported among drug addicts after excision without replacement of the tricuspid valve.A6,A7 Late survival in such patients exceeded 60% at 15 years, with death due to return to drug addiction and not to right-sided endocarditis.A6

# *Hemodynamic Status*

After excision of the tricuspid valve, the expected hemodynamic state develops. Cardiac murmurs are usually absent, but hepatomegaly with systolic pulsation is often present.F1 Jugular venous pulsations with prominent *v* waves are universal as a result of the dramatic increase in right atrial pressure during systole.

The volumes of the right atrium and RV are considerably increased within a few months of tricuspid valve removal. The atrial septum shifts to the left with each ventricular systole, and the left atrium is compressed. The deleterious effects of RV remodeling are generally progressive, but the point of irreversibility has not been defined. Tricuspid valve replacement has induced substantial reverse remodeling of the RV as long as 21 years after tricuspid valve excision.M1

## *Functional Status*

Most young patients are in NYHA functional class II for at least several years. Ankle edema and mild exercise intolerance are noted in about half the patients. Hemodynamic and functional states begin to deteriorate progressively after about 5 years, often in association with troublesome substernal fullness, which is worse in the recumbent position.S13

# Risk Factors for Premature Death after Tricuspid Valve Surgery

A general understanding of the results of tricuspid valve surgery per se, especially of the risk factors for surgical failure, is difficult to obtain because of the relative infrequency of these operations, variety of operations, numerous concomitant procedures, and heterogeneity of the patient population. It is possible to have low hospital mortality across all components of this heterogeneity, but this has not been the experience universally.

Tricuspid valve excision without replacement is clearly a risk factor for a poor early and long-term result.A7 The need for tricuspid anuloplasty and replacement, particularly the latter, has been associated with an increased risk of early death in multivalvar disease (see "Mitral Valve Surgery with Coexisting Tricuspid Valve Disease" in Chapter 11).M7 However, early mortality after these combined procedures need not necessarily be determined by the tricuspid procedure.B1

Pressure half-time not measured in patients with fusion of early and atrial velocities.

Multivariable analysis of risk factors for both early and late deaths indicates that neither repair nor replacement is associated with a greater risk than the other; type of replacement device (allograft, mechanical, bioprosthetic) was not a risk factor.M7

Older age has been a risk factor for death early and late after operation,B1 as has preoperative functional disability, as reflected in NYHA class, particularly when the disability was severeT5 and associated with cardiomegaly.B3,B4 Prior valve surgery was also a risk factor for premature late death.

# INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Selection of Anuloplasty Technique and Choice of Device

## *Tricuspid Regurgitation*

When isolated severe TR is present, operation is indicated. This should be anuloplasty rather than replacement unless competence cannot be achieved. In intravenous drug users with endocarditis, simple valve excision may suffice, but tricuspid valve replacement is preferred over total excision; partial valve excision and reconstruction can be considered for less extreme valvar destruction.A2 (Indications for operation in functional tricuspid regurgitation associated with mitral valve disease are discussed in detail under "Mitral Valve Surgery with Coexisting Tricuspid Valve Disease" in Chapter 11.) Because most tricuspid procedures are performed to accompany left-sided valve operations, the left-sided hemodynamics usually determines indications for operation. However, because NYHA class IV, severe heart failure, high mean pulmonary artery pressure, and icterus are incremental risks for mortality when a tricuspid procedure is done, intervention early rather than late in multiple valve disease is prudent.P4,V1 The general American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association Guidelines for surgical management of TR are listed in Box 14-1. In patients with severe TR secondary to pulmonary hypertension, the current standard treatment is vasodilator therapy and diuretics.

When important TR occurs late after mitral valve replacement, the outlook after tricuspid valve surgery is less optimistic. Five-year survival after subsequent operation is only 44%, and most patients who fail to survive have little or no symptomatic improvement from the tricuspid valve procedure.K7 Despite an early mortality of about 9% and important symptomatic improvement in most patients, Staab and colleagues reported event-free survival of only 42% at 5 years.S15 This suggests the frequent presence of severe and irreversible RV failure in such patients. Thus, TR after previously adequate mitral valve operation is an uncommon indication for tricuspid valve operation.

## *Choice of Anuloplasty Technique*

Several longitudinal studies indicate that severe TR is more likely to return after the De Vega and suture plication techniques than after use of anuloplasty rings. The impact of anuloplasty technique on freedom from reoperation was analyzed by McCarthy and colleagues.M5 "Non-ring" anuloplasties (De Vega and Peri-Guard) were less effective than anuloplasty rings in preventing late TR after mitral valve repair for degenerative disease. The same advantage of prosthetic ring anuloplasty over non-ring techniques was demonstrated in rheumatic mitral and tricuspid valve surgery.B6

**Box 14-1** 2006 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines Pertaining to the Surgical Management of Tricuspid Valve Regurgitation

# **Class I**

Tricuspid valve repair is beneficial for severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in patients with mitral valve (MV) disease requiring MV surgery. *(Level of Evidence: B)*

#### **Class IIa**

- **1.** Tricuspid valve replacement or anuloplasty is reasonable for severe primary TR when symptomatic. *(Level of Evidence: C)*
- **2.** Tricuspid valve replacement is reasonable for severe TR secondary to disease/abnormal tricuspid valve leaflets not amenable to anuloplasty or repair. *(Level of Evidence: C)*

## **Class IIb**

Tricuspid anuloplasty may be considered for less severe TR in patients undergoing MV surgery when there is pulmonary hypertension or tricuspid anular dilatation. *(Level of Evidence: C)*

#### **Class III**

- **1.** Tricuspid valve replacement or anuloplasty is not indicated in asymptomatic patients with TR whose pulmonary artery systolic pressure is less than 60 mmHg in the presence of a normal MV. *(Level of Evidence: C)*
- **2.** Tricuspid valve replacement or anuloplasty is not indicated in patients with mild primary TR. *(Level of Evidence: C)*

From Bonow and colleagues.B9

Similar findings were reported by Tang and colleaguesT3 and Navia and colleagues.N6 Although some surgeons have reported good results with bicuspidization or modified De Vega techniques,A5 a ring anuloplasty clearly provides more durable protection against recurrent or progressive TR. The durability of bandsM5 or pericardial stripsC5 is probably intermediate between these two techniques.

In a longitudinal study by Tang and colleagues, use of an anuloplasty ring (vs. a DeVega suture anuloplasty) was an independent predictor of better survival (hazard ratio 0-7) and event-free survival at 6 years.T3

Thus, suture plication techniques should probably be reserved for mild anular reductions in the setting of moderate TR in which repair of the left-sided valve lesions is expected to favorably impact functional TR. Rigid or flexible rings or bands are preferable to bicuspidization or De Vega techniques if major anular reduction and durability are required.

In view of the high risk of recurrent TR if pacemaker leads are left across the tricuspid valve, consideration should be given to replacing such leads with an epicardial lead at the time of tricuspid valve repair.

#### *Choice of Replacement Device*

In no other valve position is the choice between durability of a mechanical prosthesis and lack of thrombogenicity of a xenograft more apparent. It can be argued that younger patients with a better prognosis should receive a low-profile mechanical device, and older patients a xenograft.V1 Nakano and colleagues report satisfactory valve performance using an inverted Carpentier-Edwards pericardial valve (Fig. 14-8).N1

Others prefer porcine xenografts for all patients despite a 10% to 40% prevalence of structural deterioration within 7 to 10 years.K11,M6 In all cases a large device (27 mm or larger) should be implanted. There is no evidence favoring use of a xenograft in the tricuspid area when mechanical prostheses are implanted on the left side, and vice versa.
