# **Section I Anesthetic Consultation for Adult Cardiovascular Surgery**

*The principal tasks of the anesthesiologist are to provide relief from pain for patients during operation and to provide optimal operative conditions for surgeons, both in the safest manner possible. To do this, the anesthesiologist must be a competent physician and a clinical pharmacologist, with a broad knowledge of surgery and the ability to utilize and interpret correctly a variety of monitoring devices.*

*— Dripps, Eckenhoff, and Vandam* Introduction to Anesthesia: The Principles of Safe PracticeD9

Anesthetic management specifically for adult cardiovascular surgery is differentiated from management for general surgery by the high-risk profile and unique perioperative needs of the patient. Despite increasing age and comorbidity, operative mortality has been decreasing in these patients,F3 likely reflective of advances in surgical technique, better management of comorbidity, and advances in monitoring and care by dedicated cardiothoracic anesthesiologists. Furthermore, implementation of evidence-based medical practice to better justify clinical decisions continues to favorably influence patient outcomes.

#### PREOPERATIVE PREPARATION AND EVALUATION

Consultation with a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist is essential to optimal preoperative evaluation and management. A thorough history, physical examination, and understanding of the presenting cardiac pathology and proposed surgical procedures are critical. Particular focus should be on areas that may affect perioperative management, such as concomitant patient comorbidity, potential for drug interactions, challenges to airway management and invasive monitoring, as well as acuity of presenting clinical status.

#### Management of Preoperative Medications

#### *Cardiovascular Medications*

Medical management of cardiovascular comorbidity often necessitates extensive pharmacologic support. In general, most antihypertensive and antianginal cardiac medications are continued preoperatively. Whether to continue or when to withhold preoperative antihypertensive therapy requires careful consideration of patient risk/benefit. Acute withdrawal of particular antihypertensive medications such as β-blockers or clonidine may result in considerable perioperative hemodynamic instability; conversely, their continuation results in better hemodynamic stability, antiarrhythmic properties,C18,F2 and improved patient outcome.F2

Preoperative management decisions to continue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor subtype I antagonists (ARA) are controversial. Patients in whom ACE therapy was maintained until the morning of surgery had increased probability of hypotension at anesthesia induction.C14 ARA-treated patients had more postinduction hypotension refractory to conventional vasopressors than those on other antihypertensive therapy (β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or ACE inhibitors)B16; thus, some recommend discontinuing ARA before surgery.B11

Comfere and colleagues examined the relationship between timing of discontinuing chronic ACE inhibitors and ARA and development of hypotension after induction of general anesthesia.C13 Patients receiving chronic ACE inhibitors or ARA therapy less than 10 hours prior to general anesthesia were at elevated risk of developing moderate hypotension within 30 minutes of induction. However, this responded to conventional therapy and was not associated with increased occurrence of postoperative complications.

Hemodynamic instability with continuation of ACE or ARA therapy is not consistent. Licker and colleagues reported that patients treated long term with ACE inhibitors and who had normal left ventricular function did not have altered endocrine response or hemodynamic instability during cardiac surgery.L5 Furthermore, continuing therapy has beneficial effects on the myocardium and kidneys.B6,C13 If it is elected to continue these drugs on the day of surgery, one should recognize that episodic hypotension necessitating vasopressor support may occur.

Thus in general, continuation of preoperative cardiovascular medications is recommended.

#### *Statins*

Beyond lipid-lowering properties, statins possess pleiotropic effects that have been reported to reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality.C12,P1,P2 Among patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions, Pascual and colleagues reported that statin pretreatment was associated with reduced early ischemic events, primarily in those with high levels of inflammatory markers.P2 Pretreatment with fluvastatin of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) reduced P-selectin levels, an adhesion molecule that plays a role in the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis, below those of patients given a placebo.B9 Berkan and colleagues reported less use of inotropic agents among patients treated with fluvastatin, speculating that myocardial injury caused by cardiopulmonary bypass–induced inflammatory changes was reduced.B9 Others have reported a protective effect of statin pretreatment in reducing myocardial damage after CABG.M5,P2 Based on these beneficial pleiotropic effects, statin therapy should be continued routinely in the perioperative period.

#### *Medications Affecting Hemostasis*

Preoperative antiplatelet therapy affects perioperative hemostasis and may contribute to excess bleeding and increased blood product requirements.C18

**Aspirin**  In a meta-analysis of preoperative aspirin (ASA) use, Alghamdi and colleagues reported more blood loss and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, yet similar platelet transfusion and reexploration for bleeding, among patients who received ASA preoperatively.A5 Patients stopping ASA 2 days or less before surgery had higher RBC transfusion requirements than those stopping it more than 7 days preoperativelyA5; patients discontinuing ASA 3 to 7 days before surgery had little increased requirement for RBC transfusion. Discontinuing ASA 2 to 3 days preoperatively may be sufficient for return of adequate platelet function. Thus, there is little evidence to recommend a preoperative 7-day ASA-free interval.G3,W6

There are, however, reported benefits to continuing ASA therapy perioperatively. Dacey and colleagues reported that continuation of ASA therapy in isolated CABG was associated with reduced mortality without substantial risk of hemorrhage or blood product requirement.D1 Similarly, Bybee and colleagues reported that preoperative ASA use within 5 days of CABG was associated with lower in-hospital mortality and similar risk of reoperation for bleeding and blood product requirements as in those not receiving preoperative ASA.B19

Practice guidelines from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) state that although evidence indicates ASA is beneficial, recent ingestion has been associated with perioperative bleeding.F5 Guideline recommendations are as follows: class IIa recommendation to discontinue ASA 3 to 5 days before elective CABG to reduce bleeding risk; class IIa recommendation for continuation of ASA in urgent and emergency CABG, recognizing that benefits of ASA outweigh the small bleeding risk; and class I to start ASA early postoperatively to take advantage of improved graft patency and mortality benefits.F5

**Clopidogrel**  Clopidogrel, an inhibitor of platelet aggregation, works by irreversibly blocking adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-mediated platelet activation. Clopidogrel reduces thrombotic complications following coronary stenting and improves outcomes after acute coronary syndromes. Patients who undergo CABG within 3 to 5 days of clopidogrel treatment are at increased risk for bleeding, RBC requirement, and need for reoperationB8,C10,F6,K1 (Fig. 4-1). Reichert and colleagues examined the effects of a waiting period after clopidogrel treatment before CABG. Patients who received clopidogrel treatment within 72 hours of operation vs. those delayed at least 5 days after clopidogrel treatment had higher transfusion requirements (95% vs. 52%).R6

Others, however, have reported no increase in bleeding, RBC transfusion, or reexploration for bleeding in CABG patients receiving clopidogrel.K2 Ebrahimi and colleagues

**Figure 4-1** Prevalence of composite outcome (reoperation or major bleeding) by number of days clopidogrel was stopped before surgery. Denominator for points on curve is the total number of patients who were exposed to clopidogrel ≤7 days before surgery (*n* = 329); 89 patients experienced the composite outcome. Red line = clopidogrel exposure. *CABG,* Coronary artery bypass grafting. (From Berger and colleagues.B8)

examined the effect of clopidogrel in patients with non–STsegment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) requiring CABG in the Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage strategy (ACUITY) trial.E1 The trial enrolled 13,819 patients with NSTE-ACS undergoing early invasive management; 11.1% underwent CABG before discharge. Clopidogrel-exposed patients had longer median duration of hospitalization than nonexposed patients, but experienced fewer ischemic events within 30 days and had similar occurrence of non–CABG-related major bleeding and post-CABG major bleeding. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that clopidogrel use before CABG was a predictor of reduced 30-day composite ischemia.

**Combination Antiplatelet Therapy**  Cannon and colleagues reported dual antiplatelet therapy within 5 days of CABG was associated with a moderate increase in bleeding; however, combined therapy conferred no appreciable risk for bleeding if discontinued more than 5 days before CABG.C1 ASA and clopidogrel taken together until 2 days before operation is associated with higher postoperative blood loss, but not increased occurrence of reoperation for bleeding.V6 Others report increased blood product requirement with preoperative dual antiplatelet therapy.R4 For patients undergoing off-pump CABG, Shim and colleagues reported that preoperative ASA and clopidogrel exposure even within 2 days of operation did not increase perioperative blood loss and blood transfusion requirements.S9 Of note, the authors used strict transfusion guidelines and intraoperative blood salvage techniques.

**Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibitors**  Both short- and longacting glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors cause profound platelet dysfunction. In patients requiring emergency operation, they are associated with increased risk for bleeding. Recommendations for discontinuation prior to surgery vary, depending on whether the agent used is a short- or long-acting inhibitor (4 to 6 hours for short acting; 12 to 24 hours for long)F5 (Table 4-1). Lee and colleagues recommend delaying surgery for the appropriate time interval and transfusing platelets as needed rather than prophylactically.L2 De Carlo and colleagues state that emergency surgery can be performed safely in patients treated with all glycoprotein (GP)IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and similarly note that platelet transfusion should be for clinically relevant bleeding.D5 Lincoff and colleagues report that urgent CABG can be performed for abciximabtreated patients without excess mortality or important morbidity.L6

#### *Herbal Supplements*

Complementary medicine is growing, with 32% to 37% of Americans using herbal supplements in a given year.B18,H7 Herbal supplements are frequently underreported and taken in conjunction with conventional drugs. This results in the potential for herb-drug interactions that may affect absorption and metabolism and/or potentiate or antagonize cardiovascular medications.A2,A3,A9,I2

PT and PTT in animals

There are no clear data on specific herbal-anesthetic interactions, but increased bleeding tendency, cardiovascular instability, and sedation have been associated with their use.H7 Garlic, ginkgo biloba, and ginger possess antiplatelet activity that may increase bleeding risk, particularly for patients on ASA therapy.A2,A9,H7,P3 Garlic inhibits platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner. Ginkgo inhibits platelet activating factor; based on pharmacokinetic data and bleeding risk, patients should discontinue ginkgo at least 36 hours preoperatively.A9 Coumarin-containing medications such as chamomile, horse chestnut, motherwort, and tamarind also enhance bleeding risk.A2 In addition to increased bleeding risk, ginkgo biloba has been associated with elevated blood pressure when combined with thiazide diuretics.H12

Prolongation of anesthesia may result from kava, valerian, and St. John's wort. Kava, an anxiolytic and sedative, may prolong benzodiazepine sedation secondary to its ability to potentiate central nervous system depressants.A9,H7,P3 Concomitant use of opioids with valerian and kava may lead to increased central nervous system depression. Valerian produces dose-dependent sedation, which appears to be mediated through modulation of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission.A9 Ginseng may inhibit the analgesic effect of opioids.A2

Other direct effects of herbal medicines in the operative setting include cardiovascular instability from ephedra ("ma huang") and hypoglycemia from ginseng.A9 Ephedra contains alkaloids, including ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, that can increase blood pressure and heart rate. Tachyphylaxis may result from long-term use secondary to depletion of endogenous catecholamine stores, which may necessitate use of direct-acting sympathomimetic agents for hypotension.A9 Ginseng may lower postprandial glucose, resulting in hypoglycemia, particularly in fasting patients.A9 Immunosuppressant properties of echinacea theoretically increase risk for poor wound healing and infection.B15,G8,H7 Short-term use of echinacea has immunostimulatory effects that may diminish effectiveness of immunosuppressive medications in the perioperative period.A9

for addiction, tolerance, and withdrawal after abstinence

cyclosporine, warfarin, steroids, protease inhibitors, possibly benzodiazepines; decreased serum digoxin levels

benzodiazepine-like acute withdrawal; potential to increase anesthetic requirements with long-term use

In general, current recommendations are for patients to discontinue herbal medicines at least 2 weeks before surgeryA9,H7,L1 (Tables 4-2 and 4-3).

#### MONITORING

#### Cannulae

In addition to standard American Society of Anesthesiologists monitoring, large-bore intravenous (IV) and brachial or radial arterial cannulae are placed prior to induction of anesthesia. Central venous access is commonly obtained following induction of anesthesia. Decisions about whether to use a central venous triple-lumen catheter vs. a pulmonary artery flotation catheter are case and surgeon/ anesthesiologist specific, as is use of ultrasound guidance for placement.

#### Transesophageal Echocardiography

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is integral to monitoring cardiovascular patients.E3,K12,J3,Q1,S2 It is useful in identifying and determining the mechanism of cardiac pathology, can assist with separation from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and may identify unsatisfactory surgical results. In 12,566 consecutive cardiac surgical patients, Eltzschig and colleagues found that TEE influenced surgical decision making in 7% of patients pre-CPB and 2.2% post-CPB.E3

Minhaj and colleagues recommended that TEE be used routinely in all patients undergoing cardiac surgery, because the information provided substantially influences subsequent patient management. They found that TEE demonstrated new cardiac pathology in one of every three patients, and in 3% of patients, it influenced decisions regarding use of CPB.M12 Similarly, Qaddoura and colleagues support use of TEE in primary CABG, noting that it provided new findings pre- and post-CPB in 13% of patients.Q1 Early work by Leung and colleagues revealed an association between new and

TEE Doppler-derived hemodynamic indices can provide noninvasive quantitative information on intracardiac velocities, pressure gradients, and valve area.B4,O1 Estimates of forward flow (stroke volume and cardiac output) provide useful information, particularly in cases in which a pulmonary artery flotation catheter is not used (Fig. 4-2). Pulmonary artery systolic pressure can be estimated with use of the *modified Bernoulli equation* (Box 4-1), which converts instantaneous velocities to pressure gradients.O1 Stroke volume can be calculated as the product of the cross-sectional area and time velocity integral using two-dimensional and Doppler measurements.O1 Figure 4-3 and Box 4-2 illustrate TEEderived noninvasive calculation of aortic valve area.

Intraoperative TEE has particular utility and is considered standard of care for patients undergoing mitral valve repair. It allows immediate assessment of reconstructed mitral valves, revealing residual or de novo regurgitation. Whether to intervene for residual mitral regurgitation following repair is controversial. Gillham and colleagues suggest not returning to CPB for a second attempt at mitral valve repair for mild mitral regurgitation based on TEE findings alone.G4 In their

investigation, 61% of patients with mild mitral regurgitation identified by intraoperative TEE had zero to trace regurgitation at follow-up transthoracic echocardiography. On the other hand, others have reported a trend toward increased need for reoperation when TEE identifies residual mitral regurgitation following mitral valvuloplasty. F7 TEE is critical in assessing and detecting patients at risk for a rare complication following mitral valve repair: left ventricular outflow obstruction secondary to systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral valve (Table 4-4). Advances in ultrasound technology with real-time three-dimensional TEE will enhance the ability to image and add to the utility of intraoperative echocardiography in cardiac surgery. S19,S20,V1,V1

#### **Epiaortic Scanning**

Epiaortic scanning may aid surgical decision making. R11,W10 Djaiani and colleagues modify their surgical management in one third of patients based on its results in CABG. D7 Similarly, Rosenberger and colleagues report that it changed epiaortic surgical decision making in 4.1% of patients, including using cardiac arrest, performing aortic atherectomy or replacement, using off-pump support; avoiding aortic clamping; using ventricular fibrillatory arrest; changing arterial cannulation site; and avoiding aortic cannulation.

#### Cerebral Oximetry

Use of noninvasive measures of regional cerebral oxygen saturation in adult cardiac surgical patients is controversial because there are conflicting data regarding the ability of cerebral oximetry to predict outcomes following cardiac surgery. Hong and colleagues reported cerebral oximetry was not predictive of cognitive decline following heart surgery; however, patients who exhibited intraoperative desaturation required longer postoperative hospitalization. H10 Similarly, Reents and colleagues reported that use of cerebral oximetry was not predictive for postoperative cognitive performance. R5 In contrast, Slater and colleagues reported that intraoperative cerebral oxygen desaturation was associated with increased risk for cognitive decline and prolonged hospital stay after CABG. S12 More data are clearly needed to demonstrate whether complications associated with modifications in patient care are reduced by noninvasive monitoring of regional cerebral oxygenation.

#### **MEDICATIONS**

#### Premedication

With a majority of patients being admitted the same day as their surgical procedure, preoperative medications for anxiolysis are commonly administered in the preoperative holding area or operating room once the IV cannula is placed. A short-acting sedative such as midazolam is administered in doses of 1 to 2 mg and is preferred over longer-acting agents.

#### **Induction Agents**

Propofol (substituted isopropylphenol) and etomidate (a carboxylated imidazole-containing compound) are commonly used induction agents in combination with a low-dose opioid and muscle relaxant, with the goal of facilitated recovery (Table 4-5). Propofol has several properties that make it an advantageous induction agent, particularly for procedures of short duration. It facilitates more rapid awakening compared with other induction drugs, and its antiemetic effects minimize postoperative nausea. S16 Etomidate possesses minimal cardiovascular side effects, making it an ideal agent for induction in hemodynamically unstable patients and those with impaired ventricular function. However, it has a number of side effects, including pain on injection and transient adrenocortical suppression through inhibition of 11-βhydroxylase. S16 Use of etomidate, particularly in the critical care setting, is controversial because of its adrenal suppression side effects. I Ketamine (a phencyclidine derivative) is less commonly used as an induction agent, primarily because of cardiovascular side effects including increases in heart rate and blood pressure, myocardial depression, and episodic emergence delirium. S16 Thiopental is also less commonly used for induction of general anesthesia in cardiac surgery because of less favorable properties. Sie Some centers use high-dose narcotics for induction of anesthesia in cardiovascular patients.

#### Maintenance of Anesthesia

The goal of maintenance anesthesia is to maintain stable hemodynamics while allowing for facilitated recovery in a majority of patients. Maintenance of general anesthesia

typically consists of a balanced anesthetic technique employing low-dose opioid in combination with a volatile inhalational anesthetic agent or IV agent. The specific choice of opioid, inhalational agent, and muscle relaxant depends on the surgical procedure and patient hemodynamics.

No specific anesthetic maintenance regimen is more advantageous than another in terms of patient outcomes, but evidence supports the potential role of inhalational anesthetic agents in myocardial preconditioning.M9 In a double-blind randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing CABG, Meco and colleagues reported beneficial preconditioning effects of desflurane on myocardial injury (lower troponin I) and myocardial functional recovery following surgery.M9

Regional anesthesia with or without a general anesthetic has produced mixed patient outcomes. There have been reports of regional anesthetic techniques using epidural blockade in off- and on-pump cardiac surgical patientsA6,C5,S18; however, regional anesthetic techniques have not been generally adopted.

#### Opioids

Semisynthetic opioids—fentanyl, sufentanil, and remifentanil are differentiated by potency, onset, and duration of action. All have demonstrated safety and effectiveness for use in cardiac surgeryG2,T3 (Table 4-6). Cheng and colleagues conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial on the efficacy and resource utilization of remifentanil and fentanyl in fast-track recovery from cardiac surgery.C8 Both anesthetic techniques permitted early and similar times to tracheal extubation, less intense monitoring, and reduced resource utilization after CABG. Similarly, Howie and colleagues compared remifentanil to fentanyl combined with isoflurane/ propofol for early extubation following CABG.H11 Both allowed for fast-track cardiac anesthesia. In a randomized clinical trial, Mollhoff and colleagues demonstrated the efficacy and safety of remifentanil and fentanyl for fast-track CABG.M14 Time to extubation was longer, and occurrence of shivering and hypertension were higher in the remifentanil group. However, the groups had similar intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital lengths of stay. Engoren and colleagues compared three opioids used for fast-track cardiac anesthesia: fentanyl, sufentanil, and remifentanil.E4 Extubation times and costs were equivalent. Shorter duration of action of remifentanil allowed for faster recovery, but it is more expensive than fentanyl, and tracheal extubation times were similar.M19

#### Antifibrinolytic Drugs

ε-Aminocaproic acid inhibits conversion of plasminogen to plasmin by binding to the lysine binding sites on the plasminogen molecule; tranexamic acid is an alternative antifibrinolytic agent. Lysine analogs have class IA level of evidence indication for use in cardiac surgery to reduce blood loss and transfusion requirements. These drugs play an important role in blood conservation practices in cardiac surgery.C2,F4,M17,T2 Aprotinin, a serine protease inhibitor, is effective in reducing perioperative blood loss but is no longer in use because of a less favorable safety profile.F4,M3,M4,S3,S8

#### Heparin Management

#### *Monitoring*

Several automated devices are available for anticoagulation management following heparin administration; the activated clotting time (ACT) monitor is the most common. Unfractionated heparin is commonly administered on a weightbased protocol (300-400 units per kilogram) with the goal of achieving an ACT greater than 480 seconds prior to initiation of CPB. In general, if an ACT of 480 or greater has not been achieved with doses of heparin (up to 600 units · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), one should suspect heparin resistance.

#### *Heparin Resistance*

Reports of heparin resistance in cardiac surgical patients requiring CPB range between 4% and 22%.S13 Chan and colleagues statistically modeled predictors of heparin resistance in 400 patients for elective cardiac surgery.C4 Eight percent met predefined criteria for heparin resistance, defined as a

heparin requirement greater than 5 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> to achieve a pre-CPB ACT greater than 400 seconds. Preoperative use of heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, a platelet count of 300,000 or more, and albumin plasma concentration of 35 g · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> or less were risk factors for heparin resistance.

Treatment options for heparin resistance include fresh frozen plasma administration and antithrombin III therapy, but few randomized clinical trials have addressed the merits of these therapies for treating heparin resistance.S13 In one of the few randomized clinical trials, Avidan and colleagues concluded that antithrombin III was effective in restoring heparin responsiveness for a majority of patients exhibiting heparin resistance prior to CPB (the authors defined heparin resistance as an ACT < 480 seconds after 400 units · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> of heparin).A11 Interestingly, among the 52 patients randomized to antithrombin III, 21% also required fresh frozen plasma.

#### *Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia*

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune reaction occurring in 1% to 3% of patients following cardiac surgery.W2 HIT is the most frequent antibody-mediated druginduced thrombocytopenic disorder.C3 It develops as a result of platelet factor 4–heparin complexes, subsequent platelet activation, and thrombocytopenia following heparin exposure, and is induced by immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibody production.H5 Paradoxically, heparin-induced antibodymediated activation of platelets and the coagulation system may result in thrombosis.W1 Clinical features may include thrombocytopenia, defined as a 50% or greater reduction in platelet count or decrease to less than 100,000 · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , thrombosis (50%-70% of patients), and heparin-induced skin lesions (5%-10% of patients). Diagnosis rests on one or more clinical features of thrombocytopenia and thrombosis as well as detection of HIT antibodies.W3

Guidelines recommend use of unfractionated heparin for patients with a history of HIT who require cardiac surgery and are HIT antibody negative. Repeat exposure to heparin is an option if the prior HIT episode occurs more than 100 days before surgery, because HIT antibodies are transient and generally not regenerative during the brief heparin reexposure. Guidelines also recommend that heparin be restricted to CPB and that alternative anticoagulants be used pre- and postoperatively. For patients with acute HIT thrombocytopenia and HIT antibody positive—requiring surgery, it is recommended that surgery be delayed until HIT is resolved and antibodies are negative. Alternatively, a nonheparin anticoagulant such as bivalirudin can be usedD11,K13,W4 (Table 4-7).

#### *Heparin Reversal*

Following discontinuation of CPB and decannulation, heparin is reversed with protamine sulfate (typically 1 mg of protamine for every 100 units of heparin). Heparin-protamine titration may also be used to provide a more precise amount of protamine to be administered. Protamine administration has well-recognized adverse side effects, from hypotension with rapid administration to anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions.K6

#### WEANING FROM CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS

A number of factors require attention before CPB separation: achieving normothermia, proper electrolyte balance (potassium, glucose, ionized calcium), adequate hemoglobin, anticipation of inotropic and vasopressor support, reestablishing ventilatory support, heart rhythm, and need for pacing. TEE plays an integral role in weaning from CPB, particularly for patients who have undergone valve repair or who have compromised ventricular function. TEE permits rapid recognition in the partial bypass period of circumstances that could complicate separation from CPB, such as persistent valvar regurgitation, intracardiac air, or regional wall motion abnormalities related to graft failure.

#### Inotropic and Vasopressor Support

Muller and colleagues examined clinical, surgical procedure, and intraoperative factors related to the need for inotropic support following CPB, including previous myocardial infarction, heart failure, higher New York Heart Association functional class, and aortic clamp time.M16 McKinlay and colleagues incorporated information from the intraoperative TEE examination along with demographic and clinical factors to predict the need for inotropic use following separation from CPB.M8 Reoperation, wall motion score index, combined CABG and valve repair or replacement, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 35%, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, and longer aortic clamp time were risk factors. Ahmed and colleagues added laboratory and hemodynamic factors and identified four risk factors for inotropic requirement: low cardiac index, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure 20 mmHg or higher, left ventricular ejection fraction 40% or lower, and chronic kidney disease stage 3 to 5.A4

vasodilatory and inotropic properties without increasing intracellular calcium concentrations or increasing myocardial oxygen consumption. It acts by inducing a calcium-dependent conformational change of troponin C and enhances both rate and extent of cardiac contraction.E5,H1,S10 Levosimendan has demonstrated utility in facilitating weaning from CPB.E5

### SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT ISSUES

#### Fast-Track Anesthesia

Early work by Cheng and colleagues was instrumental in establishing a new standard of care for recovery from cardiac surgery by demonstrating the safety and feasibility of facilitated recovery.C7 They tested extubation within 1 to 6 hours vs. conventional tracheal extubation within 12 to 22 hours after CABG in a randomized clinical trial. Post-extubation intrapulmonary shunt fraction improved and ICU and hospital lengths of stay were shorter, without increased morbidity.C7 Similarly, Reis and colleagues reported that fasttrack and ultra–fast-track (extubated on ICU arrival) anesthesia were not associated with increased patient morbidity and mortality following CABG.R7 In off-pump CABG, Djaiani and colleagues reported facilitated operating room extubation, lower nurse-to-patient ratio, and earlier patient discharge without need for reintubation with ultra–fast-track anesthetic techniques.D8 Risk factors for delayed extubation of patients planned for fast-track anesthesia are advanced age, female gender, postoperative use of intraaortic balloon pumping, inotropes, and postoperative bleeding and atrial arrhythmias.W11

#### Perioperative Glucose Control

Poor control of perioperative glucose is associated with adverse outcomes following cardiac surgery.O2 Ouattara and colleagues reported a 7.2 increased odds of morbidity in patients with poor intraoperative glucose control (four consecutive blood glucose concentrations > 200 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> without any decrease despite insulin therapy).O2 Lipshutz and Gropper performed an evidence-based review of perioperative glycemic control, noting that hyperglycemia in the perioperative period is a risk factor for morbidity.L7 An appropriate glucose target and specific populations who might benefit from intensive insulin therapy have yet to be identified. van den Berghe and colleagues reported that intensive insulin therapy to maintain blood glucose at or below 110 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> reduced morbidity and mortality among surgical ICU patients.V2 However, there are conflicting results about whether intensive insulin therapy to normalize glucose perioperatively improved outcomes. Gandhi and colleagues examined the effect of intensive intraoperative insulin therapy vs. conventional glucose management on morbidity after cardiac surgery and found increased morbidity with glucose levels at normoglycemia.G1 Target glucose range at Cleveland Clinic is 70 to 150 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . Cleveland Clinic's intraoperative insulin management protocol and adjustment schedule are described in Appendix 4A and Table 4A-1.

#### Blood Management

RBC transfusion practices vary considerably throughout the world, despite published transfusion guidelines.M1,T2 This variability reflects insufficient information on risk-to-benefit ratio of anemia vs. transfusion and lack of randomized controlled trials examining RBC transfusion and patient outcomes. Hence, transfusion decisions tend to be based on opinion rather than evidence.H4 There have been a number of investigations demonstrating a strong association between RBC transfusion and morbidity following cardiac surgery.B10,K9,M18,S4 RBC transfusion has been associated with excess risk of cardiac and serious infectious complications, renal failure, neurologic complications, prolonged ventilatory support, in-hospital mortality, and increased resource utilization and cost. Infectious complications such as septicemia, bacteremia, and superficial and deep sternal wound infections are higher for transfused patients.B3 Possibly this is related to immunomodulatory effects known as *transfusion-associated immunomodulation* (TRIM).B12 Additional evidence supports persistent and increased late risk related to perioperative RBC transfusion, including a higher hazard for death and lower functional health-related quality of life.K10,S21

Structural and functional changes occurring during RBC storage may partially account for complications associated with transfusion.K11 Many of these changes are time dependent and include decreases in pH, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and increases in free hemoglobin, potassium, and lactate.B7 Reduced deformability is also time dependent and begins at 2 weeks and progresses throughout the storage period.R8 These time-dependent changes have been demonstrated in both the laboratory and clinical arena to contribute to adverse consequences.G5,K11,R9 Laboratory investigation demonstrates increased thrombin generation for RBC products with longer storage duration.S22 Centrifuged supernatant of stored RBC demonstrates that some RBC microvesicles express phosphatidylserine that is capable of facilitating thrombin generation. This may be a mechanism for adverse thrombotic effects for RBC with increased storage duration that has been observed in clinical investigations.S22 Concern about complications related to length of RBC storage requires further investigation to determine whether patients undergoing cardiac surgery are adversely affected by prolonged storage. The role of storage time on microcirculation, tissue oxygenation, and outcomes is currently under debate.

The risk and benefit balance of anemia and RBC transfusion is complex and at this point unsettled. Although transfusion is beneficial in subsets of patients, there is uncertainty about whom to transfuse, and when; unrestricted liberal use of RBC transfusion requires closer scrutiny. Hebert and colleagues in the Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care trial reported that restrictive transfusion strategies for RBC were as effective as liberal ones.H6 Blood conservation methods should be more widely applied and instituted, including optimization of preoperative hematocrit, use of intraoperative cell salvage, lower hemoglobin thresholds for transfusion, and use of antifibrinolytic agents. Evidence suggests that centers that have implemented evidence-based transfusion guidelines reduce use of RBC products without increasing patient morbidity.B17

### REOPERATION

Principles of anesthetic induction, maintenance, and facilitated recovery are similar for patients undergoing reoperation. Because of an increased risk for complications on sternal reentry, patients typically have additional IV access and RBC immediately available prior to sternotomy. Communication with the surgical team is essential before sternal reentry, particularly if alternative cannulation techniques (e.g., femoral or axillary artery cannulation) will be used. Surgical dissection can be challenging and lengthy, with a risk for excess bleeding, ischemia due to manipulation of prior grafts, and arrhythmias due to positioning of the heart.

#### Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting

Revascularization without CPB has several reported benefits over on-pump surgery: fewer transfusions, less early neurocognitive dysfunction, and less renal insufficiency.S5 Goals for anesthetic management are similar to those for onpump surgery; however, a number of special considerations pertain specifically to case management for off-pump CABG (OPCAB). Invasive monitoring is similar, as is facilitated recovery with extubation in the operating room or soon after in the ICU. Heparin management is surgeon and institution specific, ranging from partial to full-dose heparinization. TEE is particularly useful for detecting regional wall motion abnormalities, accessing volume status, and determining the effect of lifting and retracting the heart and stabilizer devices on hemodynamics. OPCAB can be particularly challenging in managing acute changes in hemodynamics that occur with necessary positioning and stabilization of the heart to perform coronary artery anastomosis.

TEE monitoring for OPCAB typically identifies transient regional wall-motion abnormalities during vessel occlusion.S6,S7 Temporizing measures to maintain hemodynamic stability include the Trendelenburg position, vasopressors, and IV fluids. Couture and colleagues examined mechanisms of hemodynamic changes during OPCAB, noting that mobilization and stabilization of the heart or myocardial ischemia can produce important changes in hemodynamics.C15 They report that suction- and compression-type stabilizers produce hemodynamic changes via different mechanisms. For suctiontype stabilizers, hemodynamic changes are due to heart dislocation (90-degree anterior displacement) and right ventricular compression. Compression-type stabilizers compress the left ventricular outflow tract and produce abnormal diastolic expansion secondary to direct deformation of the left ventricular geometry. Depending on collateral flow, coronary occlusion during the anastomosis can variably affect the status of left ventricular function.C15 Bainbridge and Cheng highlighted anesthetic considerations for both less invasive direct CABG and OPCAB procedures, noting goals similar to those for conventional CABG but with some key differences, including use of regional techniques for postoperative pain (unilateral paravertebral blocks or intercostal blocks).B2

#### Heart Transplantation

The approach to anesthetic management for heart transplant recipients follows principles similar to those for heart failure patients, recognizing, however, that transplant recipients often have ingested food or drink within hours of surgery. Potential heart transplant recipients typically have IV and arterial access prior to rapid-sequence or modified rapid-sequence anesthetic induction. Although alternative induction agents may be used successfully, etomidate and succinylcholine with small doses of narcotic are effective agents for this, recognizing that circulation time is longer and important hemodynamic instability secondary to reduced ejection fraction may occur. Central venous access is obtained following anesthetic induction. Maintenance of anesthesia is similar to that for other cardiovascular procedures, using a balanced technique of narcotic, muscle relaxation, and lowdose inhalation agent. Similar to other procedures, anesthetic goals are to maintain hemodynamic stability and facilitate recovery following surgery.

The newly implanted heart is denervated without vagal tone. In general, post-implantation, agents with direct-acting catecholamines are preferred; agents with indirect activity (e.g., ephedrine) may have diminished effect. Similarly, medications such as atropine and glycopyrrolate will not provide typical heart rate responses.B13,S17

TEE has particular utility in heart transplantation as a guide for separating the patient from CPB, detecting presence of intracardiac air, and evaluating ventricular function. It is particularly useful for detecting right ventricular dysfunction that may ensue, especially in patients with pulmonary hypertension.

#### Lung Transplantation

Similar to heart transplant recipients, lung transplant recipients typically have eaten within hours of surgery. A special consideration for anesthetic induction of lung transplant recipients is avoiding prolonged positive pressure with mask ventilation, which may lead to important hypotension. Central venous access is obtained following anesthetic induction. Some centers use a pulmonary artery flotation catheter pre-transplant and pull it back into the pulmonary trunk before clamping the pulmonary artery. Lung isolation is commonly achieved with a left-sided double-lumen endotracheal tube. However, use of a single-lumen endotracheal tube with a bronchial blocker for lung isolation is also an option. Ability to tolerate one-lung ventilation is assessed early, because failure to do so necessitates use of CPB. TEE may guide in assessing ventricular function during transplantation, right ventricular function upon pulmonary artery clamping, and pulmonary vein stenosis, and also in detecting intracardiac air.

Feltracco and colleagues report that lung transplantation for severe pulmonary hypertension has distinct challenges compared with other etiologies.F1 Common echocardiographic features of patients with severe pulmonary hypertension include right ventricular enlargement, tricuspid regurgitation, and diastolic dysfunction. The authors recommend ventilation strategies that include avoiding excessively increased intrathoracic pressure, moderate hypercapnia, and optimal positive end-expiratory pressure to prevent increases in pulmonary vascular resistance. They recommend CPB support in the following circumstances: intractable hypoxemia, greater than 30% reduction in cardiac output during trial of pulmonary artery clamping, doubling of pulmonary vascular resistance, an increase in systolic pulmonary artery pressure to greater than 80% of systemic systolic pressure, surgical manipulation that severely compromises cardiac function, and severe ventricular wall motion abnormalities.F1

Baez and colleagues similarly noted that hemodynamic instability may ensue from myocardial depressant effects of induction agents, with excessive positive pressure ventilation on anesthetic induction, and with surgical retraction to gain exposure while removing the lungs.B1 They recommend reducing lung hyperinflation, such as by decreased tidal volumes, lowering respiratory rate to maximize expiratory time, and permissive hypercapnia. TEE can be used to assess presence and degree of right ventricular dysfunction, which may necessitate use of pulmonary vasodilators. Those available vary in selectivity for pulmonary vasculature and cost. Agents used include milrinone, inhaled nitric oxide (preferred, because of greater selectivity for the pulmonary vasculature vs. systemic vasculature), and inhaled epoprostenol (similarly efficacious and less costly).B1

If risk from CPB is low, some centers place epidural catheters prior to anesthetic induction.M13 Goals of ventilation management include prolonging expiratory time to allow for more complete emptying of the lungs, along with permissive hypercapnia, with the thought that hypoventilation reduces hemodynamic effects of dynamic hyperinflation and auto positive end-expiratory pressure. Miranda and colleagues list various methods to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance, such as use of vasodilators and induction with 100% fraction of inspired oxygen to reverse hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.M13

#### Descending Thoracic Artery Aneurysm

Open repair of descending thoracic aorta aneurysm requires considerable anesthetic preparation. Monitoring typically necessitates large-bore IV access, right-sided brachial and femoral arterial catheter placement, central access with a large French introducer and pulmonary artery flotation catheter, a cerebro spinal fluid drainage catheter, and TEE. Depending on extent of the disease, repair may require use of CPB and circulatory arrest. OPCAB procedures employ a double-lumen endotracheal tube or single-lumen endotracheal tube with an endobronchial blocker for lung isolation. Additional venous access, if needed, is obtained via the right femoral vein, because the surgeon may choose to use left atrial–to–left femoral artery bypass. If partial bypass is used, the perfusionist can adjust flow to maintain upper-extremity mean blood pressure typically greater than 80 mmHg, and lower mean greater than 70 mmHg. Intrathecal preservativefree papaverine may be requested prior to clamping as a spinal cord protective measure. Additional neuroprotective measures include maintaining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure at less than 10 mmHg and passive cooling. Estrera and colleagues recommend early management using free CSF drainage to maintain CSF pressure at less than 10 mmHg, but later limiting cerebrospinal drainage unless neurologic deficit occurs.E6

In addition to hypothermia and CSF drainage for spinal protective measures, monitoring of somatosensory (SSEP) or motor-evoked potentials (MEP) has been reported to provide additional protection.S11 Keyhani and colleagues note that MEPs and SSEPs are highly correlated only when intraoperative changes are irreversible, and these irreversible changes are associated with immediate neurologic deficit.K5 Normal SSEP and MEP findings have strong negative predictive value, indicating that patients without signal loss were likely to be without a neurologic deficit.K5 Some centers have used epidural cooling with epidural catheters placed at thoracic (T) T-12 to lumbar (L) L-1 and a 4F intrathecal thermistor catheter placed at L-3–L-4.L4

Jacobs and colleagues reported that MEP is a highly reliable technique to assess spinal cord ischemia and is useful in reducing paraplegia during thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair.J2 Their protocol includes CSF drainage, moderate hypothermia, and left heart bypass with selective organ perfusion. MEP was used to monitor spinal cord function, and when important decreases occurred, hemodynamic (raising distal aortic and mean arterial pressure) and surgical (reattachment of visible intercostal arteries) strategies were employed.J2

Endovascular stenting of thoracic aortic aneurysms is a less invasive approach to repair. Anesthetic management may be regional (spinal or epidural) or general. Disadvantages of regional anesthesia include patient movement, inability to use TEE as a monitoring tool, potential for hypotension with sympathectomy, and difficulty establishing an airway should complications occur during the procedure.G9

#### Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is currently used for patients with aortic stenosis who have important comorbidity and are not surgical candidates because of high operative risk. Cheung and Ree summarized the procedure's four key steps: surgical access (via femoral vein or artery, or left ventricular apex), native aortic valvuloplasty (predilatation by balloon valvuloplasty), positioning and deployment of the prosthesis, and surgical closure.C9 TEE can assist with proper sizing by providing measurement of aortic anular dimension, guidewire advancement, and valve prosthesis positioning. TEE has particular utility in identifying complications with placement, such as device embolization, tamponade, perivalvar regurgitation, and coronary ostial obstruction with resultant regional wall-motion abnormalities.C9 Pharmacologic agents (adenosine or β-blockers) or, more commonly, rapid ventricular pacing are used for device deployment to attenuate left ventricular ejection. The procedure is performed under general anesthesia, which is beneficial for patient immobility, tolerance of rapid ventricular pacing, and better management of complications.C9

#### Ventricular Assist Devices

Anesthetic management for placing left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) focuses on considerations similar to those for severe heart failure, recognizing that these patients are critically ill with limited cardiac reserve and may have considerable hemodynamic instability on anesthetic induction.M10 TEE is a critical monitoring tool (Table 4-9). Identifying intracardiac shunts, such as a patent foramen ovale (PFO), has implications post implantation. An unrecognized PFO may lead to hypoxemia because unloading of the left ventricle leads to decreased left atrial pressure, which may result in substantial right-to-left shunting. TEE detection of aortic regurgitation is also critical, because this will reduce forward flow from the LVAD. In addition, TEE is useful for identifying right ventricular dysfunction, position of the inflow cannula, and de-airing.C11

Bleeding is not uncommon following LVAD insertion and is often multifactorial, with hepatic dysfunction, preoperative anticoagulation, and excessive fibrinolysis.E2 Patients with severe right ventricular dysfunction may need a right ventricular assist device, use of pulmonary vasodilators (nitric oxide), or both.G6

#### CONCLUSION

Practice of contemporary cardiothoracic anesthesia requires expertise in monitoring, coagulation, and pharmacology. Continued advances in perioperative monitoring, more selective pharmacologic agents, and focused research supporting evidence-based care will further advance the specialty and ultimately contribute to improved patient outcomes.

## **Section II Anesthesia for Neonates and Children**

INFANTS AND CHILDREN UNDERGOING CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS (OPEN PROCEDURES)

Substantial improvements have been made in anesthetic management of children with congenital heart disease. This is particularly true for neonates and patients undergoing staged repair of single-ventricle malformations. The anesthesiologist must possess a comprehensive understanding of each congenital malformation and its altered physiology, as well as a broad knowledge of pediatric medicine and pediatric cardiology.

For the acutely ill child who requires ventilatory and inotropic support preoperatively, anesthetic management must be carefully constructed to optimize cardiac output, and in those with shunt-dependent physiology, to balance systemic and pulmonary blood flow. Increasingly, children outside the newborn period arrive for cardiac operations on the same day as admission. Thus, the anesthesiologist must have access to the history and all cardiac diagnostic information before meeting with the child and family. In many centers, a formal conference occurs regularly to review historical, radiographic, echocardiographic, and cardiac catheterization data. Associated problems (e.g., reactive airway disease, airway anomalies, renal dysfunction, congenital syndromes) are discussed.

Upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) increase the perioperative risk of airway-related adverse events, because hyperreactivity of the airways can persist as long as 6 to 8 weeks following a URI. In a prospective study of children with heart disease undergoing elective surgery, those with a recent URI had increased postoperative respiratory complications (29% vs. 17%), bacterial infections (fivefold increased risk), marginally prolonged length of ICU stay, and multiple complications compared with those not having a URI.M2 Although there were no long-term sequelae related to the URI (the study was not powered to address the increased mortality risk related to URI), the decision to proceed with elective surgery must be carefully weighed against the inconvenience of postponing surgery or the increased risk from postponement.

Presence of shunts, patches, and conduits affects selection of anesthetic and surgical approaches. Previous aortopulmonary shunts or subclavian flap repair for coarctation of the aorta may reduce blood flow to the right or left arm, resulting in reduced blood pressure in that extremity. This information must be available for appropriate monitoring.

#### Laboratory Evaluation

Laboratory evaluation should include analysis of hemoglobin, hematocrit, pulse oximetry, and serum electrolytes in patients receiving diuretics or those with renal insufficiency. An elevated hematocrit in a normovolemic child reflects the magnitude and chronicity of cyanosis. Hematocrit levels above 60% may predispose the patient to capillary sludging and stroke. Because of liberalized feeding guidelines that allow administration of clear liquids up to 3 hours before induction, admission for preoperative IV hydration is seldom required for most patients. However, it is important to achieve adequate hydration in cyanotic infants.

#### Premedication

Premedication is used to achieve adequate sedation and maintain respiratory and hemodynamic stability. In children with complex congenital heart disease, premedication is directed toward decreasing oxygen consumption, improving systemic oxygen saturation, and promoting satisfactory anesthetic induction. Oral administration is effective and widely accepted. Dosage is adjusted based on age and clinical condition, but most centers use 0.5 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> of midazolam orally 10 to 20 minutes before anesthetic induction, up to a maximum dose of 20 mg. Dosages of 0.7 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> may be used in hemodynamically stable younger children, with lower doses of 0.3 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in children with reduced myocardial reserve. Generally, children younger than age 6 months do not require premedication. In uncooperative children or those with autism, a 3- to 5-mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> intramuscular dose of ketamine is safe and effective.

#### Physiologic Monitoring

Physiologic monitoring includes routine noninvasive monitoring as well as an arterial catheter, central venous catheter, and temperature probes. In term newborns, a 22-gauge radial arterial catheter is preferred. In small babies or premature infants, a 24-gauge catheter is used. Posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arterial catheters should be avoided because of their tendency to function poorly after CPB. Femoral artery catheters may be used, but because of future need for cardiac catheterizations, they are not preferred. In extremely lowbirth-weight babies, a 22-gauge axillary arterial line can be placed. Use of an umbilical artery catheter for up to 7 days is appropriate for newborns.

Many centers employ percutaneous central venous catheters as a standard monitoring tool. When available, these catheters must be placed under ultrasound guidance to increase safety and decrease risk of complications.V3 Placing percutaneous central catheters should be carefully considered in infants with single-ventricle physiology, because thrombosis of upper-extremity vessels could preclude or complicate a future bidirectional Glenn procedure. Size and length of central venous catheters placed percutaneously should be based on age and weight of the patient.A7 Others rely on directly placed transthoracic catheters placed before or after repair of the malformation to obtain information for separation from CPB. However, these do not allow central venous pressure monitoring in the prebypass period or effective monitoring of superior vena cava (SVC) pressure during CPB. Although not universally employed, direct measurement of left atrial, right atrial, and pulmonary artery pressures via small indwelling catheters provides more accurate assessment of central pressures than other methods used to guide treatment in the postbypass and postoperative periods.

#### Temperature

Thermistor probes are placed for measuring rectal (core) and either nasopharyngeal or tympanic membrane temperatures. Nasopharyngeal and tympanic membrane temperatures provide a reasonable estimate of brain temperature. Large gradients between rectal and nasopharyngeal or tympanic membrane temperature may reflect inadequate total-body cooling and may predispose the patient to unanticipated warming during periods of circulatory arrest or lowflow CPB.

#### Intraoperative Echocardiography

Intraoperative TEE is important for monitoring myocardial function and detecting air emboli, in addition to providing a morphologic map for surgical repair. In the postinduction period, TEE provides an opportunity to assess the anatomy and revise the operative plan if necessary.R1 It permits assessment of systolic and diastolic function, identification of valvar dysfunction, and estimation of pulmonary artery pressure. These observations may lead to modifying the anesthetic plan. After CPB, previously unidentified malformations and residual defects can be identified and corrected in the same operative setting, which may reduce morbidity and mortality.M15 In patients weighing less than 2.5 kg, the TEE probe should be placed with caution because of risk of esophageal injury and airway obstruction. In such instances, use of an intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) probe should be considered. To do this, a 4.0 uncuffed endotracheal tube is placed in the esophagus and taped to the angle of the mouth. The ICE probe is passed through this esophageal tube for the TEE exam; following the exam, it is withdrawn and placed in cold water to cool the end of the probe.

#### Neurologic Monitoring

Although not yet standard of care, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring, either alone or with transcranial Doppler (TCD) and some form of electroencephalography (EEG), is used in several children's heart surgery programs.K3,M15 It is our practice to routinely monitor NIRS during heart surgery, on or off CPB. TCD is valuable in detecting emboli and during antegrade cerebral perfusion to determine optimal flow. However, the angle of insonation is important, and changing this will change the velocity of flow measured. Positioning the TCD probe in infants is challenging. TEE is also an invaluable monitor of emboli, a use that must not be overlooked. Of the modalities, EEG is least useful in the operative setting,A10 because it is susceptible to changes in intraoperative temperature and the type of anesthetic agents used.

#### *Near-Infrared Spectroscopy*

Light in the near-infrared (700-1300 nm) range has three important physical properties that make it useful for diagnostic assessment:

- It penetrates tissue.
- It is non-ionizing.
- It is absorbed differentially by relevant chromophores depending on their oxygen-binding state.

When near-infrared light is emitted across a tissue (e.g., brain) and detected at its exit, absorption of the light can be used to calculate chromophore concentration using variants of the Beer-Lambert equation. All optical spectrometers consist of the same basic components: a light source of known intensity and wavelength, a light detector to measure the intensity of the light exiting the tissue, and a computer to translate the changes in light intensity into clinically useful information such as the concentrations of HbO2, hemoglobin, or oxidized cytochrome aa3.

When photons impinge on biological materials, their transmission depends on a combination of reflectance, scattering, and absorption effects. A light source (light-emitting diode or laser source) emits near-infrared light that passes through a "banana-shaped" reflectance path in the frontal cerebral cortex to two to three detectors placed 3 to 5 cm from the emitter. Absorption occurs at specific wavelengths, determined by the molecular properties of the material in the light path. Optical path length for reflected light is linearly related to spacing between transmission and receiving sites, so many NIRS measurement instruments place the transmitting diode and light detector several centimeters apart on the head. Although this spacing results in a measurable signal intensity, it affects the amount and depth of tissue monitored. On a practical level, the available instruments space their transmitting and receiving sites differently, thus measuring different quantities and depths of tissue, which makes comparisons between instruments difficult.

Shallow arcs of light travel across skin and skull but do not penetrate the cerebral tissue. Deep arcs of light cross skin, skull, dura, and cortex. Subtracting the absorbance measured in the narrow arc from that measured in the deep arc leaves absorbance that is due to intracerebral chromophores. This is one of the distinguishing characteristics of cerebral oximeters compared with pulse oximeters. Cerebral oximeters use spatial resolution techniques to differentiate cortical from extracranial blood, whereas pulse oximeters differentiate pulsatile (arterial) from nonpulsatile (venous/capillary) blood. Cerebral oximetry measures predominantly venous saturation (75:25 or 85:15, depending on age and model used)W5. NIRS could be a surrogate for jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO2) monitoring without being invasive. It does not depend on pulse, blood pressure, or body temperature. This makes the technique ideally suited for monitoring oxygenation during CPB, hypothermic circulatory arrest, shock, or cardiovascular collapse.

**Validation of NIRS**  Studies in humans have focused on measuring SjvO2 under controlled experimental and clinical conditions and determining its correlation with cerebral oximetry.D2 NIRS correlates well with SjvO2 as well as with superior vena cava oxygen saturation (ScvO2).R3 NIRS values also have been validated in piglet studies that correlate regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) values and metabolic markers of cerebral oxygenation, such as cerebral ATP, phosphocreatine (PCr), and brain lactate concentrations. Human and animal data support the ischemic threshold value of approximately 45%. Prolonged periods of NIRS values in this range have been correlated with adverse postoperative neurologic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in newborns undergoing surgery for hypoplastic left heart physiology.D6 In piglets, increasing lactates and decreasing ATP concentrations were noted at cerebral oxygen saturation (ScO2) values of 33% to 44%.K14

**Clinical Applications**  To use the device, one or two cerebral oximeter probes are placed on the forehead below the hairline. Andropoulos and colleagues reported that during antegrade cerebral perfusion, left-sided cerebral saturation was substantially lower than the right (92%-94% right and 60%-65% left).A8 However, the left-sided values were well within normal limits, and the right-sided values suggest luxury perfusion. Such large differences have not been our observation in more than a decade of neuromonitoring (unpublished), suggesting that the circle of Willis is intact in most neonates, and blood flow is adequate to both hemispheres during antegrade cerebral perfusion. However, with ongoing miniaturization of oximetry probes, it may be possible to place bilateral NIRS oximeters (Table 4-10).

The landmark Austin and colleaguesA10 observational study using multimodality neurologic monitoring must be credited with the interest in NIRS for pediatric open heart surgery. These authors reported a 26% postoperative adverse neurologic outcome when intraoperative desaturations were not treated vs. only 6% when the changes were treated. ScO2 is a balance between oxygen delivery and utilization. If the latter remains unchanged, then any decrements in cerebral saturation must be due to decreased cerebral oxygen delivery. This could be due to decrease in arterial saturation, hemoglobin, or cerebral blood flow. Hence, if ScO2 decreases in the face of normal pulse oximetry (SpO2), it is important to decide why cerebral oxygen delivery has changed. Conditions of increased utilization include hyperthermia, seizures, and change in level of arousal; these must be treated. During initiation of CPB, one of the common causes for decreased rSO2 is arterial cannula malposition or occlusion to venous drainage, which decreases cerebral perfusion pressure and reduces cerebral blood flow. Moreover, cerebral oximetry could be a guide to hypothermic circulatory arrest and intermittent perfusion, making circulatory arrest safer.M6

**Outcomes after Heart Surgery and NIRS Monitoring**  The Austin study was a retrospective cohort study; no

randomized trial of NIRS has been conducted in children. Recently, Hunaid and colleaguesV5 addressed the issue of whether intraoperative cerebral oximetry during cardiac surgery could lead to improved clinical outcomes. They reviewed nearly 500 papers, of which 8 were included in the best-evidence topic analysis. The only study that included children was the one by Austin and colleagues (class 1b level of evidence); the other seven were studies of adults undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting or valve surgery. In all of these, the authors noted reduced postoperative neurocognitive deficits (class 1b to 2b level of evidence) and concluded that judicious use of cerebral oximetry reduced major organ morbidity and mortality; despite the moderate cost associated with its use, all support using the device routinely during open heart surgery.

Although Dent and colleaguesD6 showed a correlation between prolonged low rSO2 (<45% rSO2 for ≥180 minutes) and new MRI abnormalities in a group of neonates who underwent the Norwood procedure with ACP, more recently in a prospective study of neonates with either single- or twoventricle physiology undergoing surgery with CPB and ACP,K7 they were unable to show an association between new white matter injury on postoperative MRI and prolonged low perioperative rSO2%.A8 However, it is important to note that in this study, 50% of patients in the single-ventricle group had prolonged low rSO2 (<45% for 240 minutes), a third of whom had new white matter injury in the postoperative period. No patients in the two-ventricle group had prolonged rSO2% below 45% for 120 minutes. Although stroke and chorea are obvious neurologic abnormalities, subtle neurocognitive changes are difficult and expensive to establish. Thus, despite lack of level 1A evidence that NIRS improves neurocognitive outcomes, we recommend intraoperative cerebral oximetry as a tool to optimize anesthesia (ventilation, oxygenation), perfusion (alpha-stat, pH-stat, hemoglobin, flow, temperature) and surgical techniques (cannulation). Figure 4-4 shows the Stanford management strategy for maintaining rSO2 within 20% of baseline.

#### Anesthetic Agents

A wide variety of anesthetic drugs have been used successfully and safely, including inhalation agents such as sevoflurane, and IV agents such as propofol, fentanyl, midazolam, thiopental, and ketamine (IV or intramuscular).R10,W9 For critically ill neonates, opioid drugs with or without benzodiazepine are generally preferred. Fentanyl is most often used, titrated in 5 to 10 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> increments with or without midazolam (0.1 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> per increment) until the patient is no longer responsive. A nondepolarizing muscle relaxant is then administered (e.g., vecuronium, rocuronium, pancuronium). Alternatively, combined infusions of opioids and benzodiazepines may be used.K4 Pancuronium causes a mild vagal blockade and an increase in heart rate. This effect—which is undesirable in adults with coronary artery disease—is appropriate in infants and children, who have a greater dependence on heart rate for augmenting cardiac output. Additionally, use of an opioid tends to reduce heart rate, and pancuronium will prevent this reduction. Ketamine in doses of 1 to 2 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> is an IV agent, has minimal effects on hemodynamics, and allows the concentration of inhalation agent to be reduced or turned off altogether. Regardless of the anesthetic used, 80% of children with poor myocardial function experience hypotension requiring treatment.K7

Presence of intracardiac shunts affects anesthetic induction. Presence of right-to-left shunt leads to rapid IV induction but can slow inhalational induction with a volatile anesthetic because of decreased pulmonary blood flow.H14 Left-to-right shunts generally do not affect speed of induction. These physiologic effects must be considered when choosing an anesthetic. This also makes de-bubbling all medications and IV fluid mandatory.

#### Intubation and Ventilation

Endotracheal intubation can be performed orally or nasally; the preference is based less on science and more on institutional choice. An orotracheal or nasotracheal tube of proper diameter and length is introduced and fixed in position.S15 Cuffed endotracheal tubes (ETTs) have traditionally been avoided in children younger than 8 years of age. A recent multicenter randomized trial in patients younger than age 5, including neonates, found cuffed ETTs to be reliable in infants and children.W7 In fact, the number of attempts at tube changes to place the correct-sized tube was reduced, and cuffed tubes did not increase the risk of post-extubation stridor. It is important to measure ETT cuff pressure and maintain it below 20 cm H2O to minimize risk of tracheal mucosal ischemia. In neonates and extremely low-birthweight infants, it is prudent to obtain an intraoperative chest radiograph to confirm ETT position.

Traditional anesthesia ventilators have limitations that make accurately ventilating pediatric patients challenging.S14 If indicated, an intensive care ventilator is set up in the operating room.

High fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FIO2) is avoided in children with shunt physiology or a nonrestrictive ventricular septal defect. Oxygen is a potent pulmonary vasodilator, and use of high concentrations can reduce systemic cardiac output (Qs ) by diverting more of the cardiac output

On cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), if Sco<sub>2</sub> decreases 20% below baseline and persists for more than a minute, intervene. Transient decreases with cannulation usually resolve, but if they do not, cannulae should be repositioned. Decreases are most often seen during normothermic beating heart surgery. Under these conditions, if anesthetic doses are adequate, cool further or liberalize the Paco<sub>2</sub> on CPB, or both. Key: *Hct*, Hematocrit.

through the shunt into the pulmonary circulation  $(\dot{Q}p)$ . Similarly, a low partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide  $(PaCO_2)$  can reduce pulmonary vascular resistance (Rp), increase  $\dot{Q}p$ , and reduce  $\dot{Q}s$ . Increased  $PaCO_2$  increases Rp and thus also may be hazardous in patients with intracardiac or extracardiac shunts. Therefore, induction with reduced  $FiO_2$  and a normal or slightly elevated  $PaCO_2$  is helpful in balancing blood flow between the systemic and pulmonary circulations.

#### Maintenance of Anesthesia

A combination of an opioid, usually fentanyl, and an inhalation anesthetic, usually isoflurane, is used for anesthesia maintenance. In general, children with limited cardiac reserve are maintained primarily on an opioid anesthetic, with low concentrations of inhalation agent as a supplement when tolerated. Historically, use of high-dose opioids has been advocated to blunt the stress response in neonates and infants. More recently, lower doses of opioids have proved to be equally effective, with less release of inflammatory mediators and a lesser degree of endothelial injury. GT

In patients in whom early extubation is planned, anesthesia in the postbypass period is maintained with an inhalation anesthetic, and use of fentanyl is limited. Remifentanil is a synthetic ultra–short-acting narcotic metabolized by plasma cholinesterase, with a half-life of 3 to 5 minutes, and has been used for fast-track anesthesia in children. F8 Onset of CPB affects plasma levels of anesthetic drugs because of dilution and drug binding to oxygenator, and additional dosing is required.

In combination with general anesthesia, both epidural and spinal anesthesia have been safely used in children undergoing open heart surgery. H3,H13 Maintenance of anesthesia is accomplished with inhalation of isoflurane and supplemental IV midazolam. This technique facilitates early extubation and provides excellent postoperative pain control.

# INFANTS AND CHILDREN UNDERGOING HYPOTHERMIA WITH OR WITHOUT CIRCULATORY ARREST

In neonates and infants who require complex operative repairs, hypothermic low-flow CPB or hypothermic circulatory arrest may be used. During the prebypass period, the patient's temperature should be maintained above 30°C to 32°C to minimize the effects of hypothermia on cardiac

output and prevent dysrhythmias. Using CPB, the patient is cooled to between 15°C and 20°C nasopharyngeal or tympanic membrane temperature and rectal temperature. The goal is to achieve optimal uniform cooling through a combination of core cooling using CPB and surface cooling using a cooling blanket beneath the patient. Room temperature is lowered after arterial and venous catheter placement. When circulatory arrest is planned, ice packs are placed around the child's head after initiating CPB.

### Cardiopulmonary Bypass

With initiation of CPB, cooling is started. In neonates and infants undergoing hypothermia, the pump prime may be maintained at a temperature of 18°C to 22°C (cold), 30°C (moderate), or 37°C (warm).

Duration of cooling before reducing flow to low levels or initiating circulatory arrest is generally 20 to 25 minutes. Cooling should proceed at a controlled rate so that temperature does not fall more than 1°C per minute (see Chapter 2). A reduced rate of head or rectal cooling may indicate suboptimal tissue perfusion or a malpositioned temperature probe. If pump flow is inadequate, vasodilators (e.g., phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine) can be added directly to the CPB circuit. During cooling and before circulatory arrest, arterial blood gases and hematocrit are measured and necessary adjustments made.

In children, the appropriate arterial blood gas management strategy during hypothermia is the pH-stat technique. B5,D10 This technique is favored more in children than in adults. A1 The reason is that pH-stat management leads to more cerebral emboli, the primary etiology for postoperative cognitive dysfunction in adults; in children, it is hypoxic ischemia. During cooling and rewarming periods, pH-stat provides better cerebral blood flow, particularly in patients with aortopulmonary collaterals, Band is also useful during antegrade cerebral perfusion, because the increased cerebral blood flow allows for rapid cooling. Data are unclear but suggest overall that pH stat is useful in most pediatric patients; however, crossover strategies may be another option (see Chapter 2).

#### Separation from Cardiopulmonary Bypass

The patient is rewarmed to a core temperature of 35°C to 36°C, the heart is filled and allowed to eject, arterial blood gases are obtained to ensure adequate acid-base balance, and calcium level is corrected to normal values for neonates and infants. Pacing wires are applied to the heart and tested, and the heart rate is maintained at an age-appropriate level using atrial or atrioventricular sequential pacing if needed. In most patients, low-dose dopamine (5 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) is begun prior to weaning from CPB.

If high doses of inotropic agents are required despite adequate preload and ventilatory support, presence of a residual anatomic defect or poor adaptation to new loading conditions resulting from the operative repair may be contributing factors. TEE is helpful for determining the cause of the low output state.

#### Rationale for Specific Therapies

#### *Right Ventricular (Pulmonary Ventricle) Dysfunction*

Primary right ventricular (RV) dysfunction may occur after intracardiac surgery in neonates, infants, and children. Diagnosis of RV dysfunction is suggested by high right-sided filling pressures, liver distension, hypotension, tachycardia, reduced cardiac output, and systemic venous desaturation (low mixed-venous saturation).

Treatment of RV dysfunction is directed toward improving oxygen delivery by increasing preload, augmenting contractility directly or indirectly, enhancing coronary perfusion, and reducing afterload.

The RV is generally less responsive to inotropic support than the left ventricle and therefore may require higher doses of inotropic agents. Epinephrine enhances RV contractility.M7 By improving systemic arterial pressure, epinephrine can augment RV coronary blood flow. Maintaining a normal to slightly elevated systolic arterial pressure will maximize coronary perfusion and augment RV contractility. Milrinone, a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor, is a useful inotrope with pulmonary vasodilatory properties. In a randomized controlled trial of infants and children after heart surgery, a bolus of 75 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> followed by a 0.75 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> infusion reduced the occurrence of low cardiac output syndrome by 55%.H8,H9 Stanford's institutional preference is a bolus of 25 to 50 µg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> during rewarming, followed by an infusion of 0.5 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . Communication with the surgeon is important prior to administering the bolus even on CPB, because some surgeons are concerned with the hypotension that could result.

RV afterload can be decreased by mechanical ventilation with or without nitric oxide (NO). Mechanical ventilation should be adjusted to optimize preload and decrease afterload. The RV is extremely sensitive to alterations in intrathoracic pressure; therefore, ventilation that enables the lowest possible mean airway pressure should be the goal. Increased mean intrathoracic pressure increases RV afterload by direct compression of alveolar and extra-alveolar pulmonary vessels.

NO is an endothelium-derived smooth muscle relaxant. It has been used in neonates with persistent pulmonary hypertension and in pulmonary hypertension related to congenital heart disease. NO decreases Rp and reduces intrapulmonary shunting, which may improve oxygenation. However, results of its use in the postoperative period are conflicting. In a randomized controlled trial of more than 100 infants at high risk for pulmonary hypertension, 20 ppm not only failed to show any benefit but did not prevent pulmonary hypertensive crisis in children after congenital heart surgery.D3 However, in a similar population, others have shown it to be effective even at lower doses.M11 If NO is used, NO2 levels should be monitored and NO should not be abruptly withdrawn, because rebound pulmonary hypertension can occur.

If these measures are unsuccessful, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) should be implemented (see Chapter 5). EMCO unloads the RV and favorably shifts the oxygen supply-demand ratio, often allowing the injured myocardium to recover.

#### *Left Ventricular (Systemic Ventricle) Dysfunction*

After separation from CPB, the contractile state of the systemic ventricle may be depressed. Contributing factors include preoperative condition of the myocardium (myocardial hypertrophy, elevated end-diastolic pressure, systolic dysfunction), response of the myocardium to the new loading conditions imposed by the operative repair, effects of hypothermia on myocardial compliance, suboptimal myocardial management, and residual anatomic problems.

Systemic ventricular dysfunction is managed by optimizing preload, afterload, and heart rate (see Chapter 5). Tachycardia (>180-190 beats · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) may impair ventricular function in newborns and infants and should be treated with β-adrenergic blocking agents and, if necessary, vasopressors. When the heart rate is less than 120 to 130 beats · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , atrial or atrioventricular sequential pacing is appropriate.

If inotropic support is necessary, it is usually initiated with dopamine (5-10 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) (see Table 4-8). Infusion of calcium intravenously is an important step to augment ventricular contractility in pediatric patients (20 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> bolus, followed by an infusion of 10-20 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ). Epinephrine is also a potent inotropic agent and is particularly useful in patients with important systemic ventricular dysfunction.

Clinical studies of the effects of milrinone in pediatric patients have shown considerable benefit, especially in those whose myocardium is afterload sensitive, such as patients who have had an arterial switch operation.C6 Other trials suggest a different dosing regimen.H8

#### *Management of Hypoplastic Left Heart Physiology*

In the preinduction period, ductal patency must be maintained with prostaglandins to ensure systemic cardiac output. Management depends on optimizing systemic oxygen delivery (by increasing cardiac output) and restricting Qp .

In patients with hypoplastic left heart physiology, Rp decreases within hours of delivery, thereby redistributing blood flow away from the systemic circulation. Excessive Qp can be reduced by hypoxia or hypercarbia, because both raise Rp. In the preoperative period, 3% CO2 mixture compared with a 17% hypoxic gas mixture improved not only ScO2 but also cardiac output.R2,T1 During administration of CO2, the patient must be sedated or given a muscle relaxant to eliminate increased respiratory effort. When transporting patients with single-ventricle physiology to the operating room, monitoring of hemodynamic state and arterial oxygen saturation is essential.

Before discontinuing CPB, ionized calcium levels and hematocrit must be optimized to ensure adequate oxygen-carrying capacity. Myocardial function is supported by judicious use of inotropes. Tidal volume is increased to account for a reduction in lung compliance, and minute ventilation is adjusted to maintain normocarbia. After separation from CPB, FIO<sub>2</sub> is adjusted to maintain SaO<sub>2</sub> between 75% and 85% and an arterial PaO<sub>2</sub> of 40 to 50 mmHg.

Modified ultrafiltration has been shown to improve myocardial function, decrease lung water, and remove inflammatory mediators in patients with hypoplastic left heart physiology as well as other complex malformations (see Chapter 2).

Excessive  $\dot{Q}p$  is less common in the immediate postbypass period. After modified ultrafiltration and before chest closure, the anesthesiologist should estimate  $\dot{Q}p/\dot{Q}s$  and attempt to adjust FIO<sub>2</sub> and minute ventilation accordingly.

Chest closure can markedly reduce lung compliance and worsen hemodynamics. Leaving the chest open may improve  $\dot{Q}p$  and heart filling by reducing mean airway pressure.

# Rationale for Managing Fontan, Hemi-Fontan, and Bidirectional Glenn Procedures

Patients undergoing a bidirectional Glenn or hemi-Fontan procedure usually have had either a pulmonary trunk band or a systemic–pulmonary artery shunt in the neonatal period. Cardiac performance may be impaired by either a small noncompliant ventricle or a large dilated ventricle, the latter resulting from excessive aortopulmonary shunt flow. Inotropic support may therefore be necessary in the prebypass period as well as postoperatively.

After the bidirectional Glenn or hemi-Fontan procedure, cardiac output is generally well maintained because inferior vena cava flow mixes with pulmonary venous blood in the physiologic left atrium. Low systemic arterial saturation and reduced Qp, however, are problems in the postoperative period. A marked discrepancy between end-tidal carbon dioxide (Petco<sub>2</sub>) and Paco<sub>2</sub> is an early sign of reduced Qp. If Qp is reduced with no residual cardiac abnormalities, cardiac output should be optimized and interventions to lower Rp employed. To optimize cardiopulmonary interactions, children undergoing bidirectional Glenn or Fontan operations should be considered for fast-track anesthesia.

# INFANTS AND CHILDREN NOT UNDERGOING CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS (CLOSED PROCEDURES)

The most common procedures that do not involve CPB are *palliative* (systemic–pulmonary artery shunting and pulmonary trunk banding) or *corrective* (ligation of patent ductus arteriosus or repair of coarctation of the aorta).

#### **Palliative Procedures**

Palliative procedures are performed under general anesthesia with monitoring of systemic arterial pressure. Measurement of arterial pressure, SaO<sub>2</sub>, and PETCO<sub>2</sub> are necessary to assess the procedure's adequacy. Important reduction in PETCO<sub>2</sub> after pulmonary trunk banding indicates that Qp may be excessively reduced. This is followed by a precipitous drop in SaO<sub>2</sub>. If the banding procedure is optimal, systemic arterial blood pressure should increase by approximately 10 to 15 mmHg. The gradient between PETCO<sub>2</sub> and PaCO<sub>2</sub> should

be about 6 to 10 mmHg.  $SaO_2$  should be no lower than 75% to 80%, and pulmonary arterial pressure should decrease to about 50% of systemic pressure.

#### Closure of Patent Ductus Arteriosus

Anesthetic considerations for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure depend on the ductus size and clinical condition and age of the patient. Babies with a large PDA and low Rp generally present with excessive Qp and heart failure. Neonates and premature infants also may have left ventricular dysfunction from coronary ischemia due to substantial diastolic runoff to the pulmonary circuit. Thus, patients range from the relatively healthy young child to the sick ventilator-dependent premature infant on inotropic agents. Healthy children can tolerate a variety of anesthetic techniques with extubation in the operating room and use of epidural/caudal analgesia. Symptomatic neonates and premature infants require a carefully controlled anesthetic and fluid management plan.

Most preterm infants who fail medical management consisting of indomethacin, diuretics, and fluid restriction require admission to a neonatal ICU. A common finding is sepsis, so it is important to ascertain a history of medical treatment and verify negative blood cultures before surgical intervention. Premature neonates with ductal patency are operated on in the neonatal ICU, thereby avoiding transport hazards such as hypothermia, multiple transfers to and from infant incubators, inadvertent extubation, and venous access disruption.

In the neonatal ICU, the patient is positioned on a warmer, and access to the patient must be shared among the anesthesiologist, surgeon, surgical assistant, and scrub nurse. Careful positioning of an IV catheter and rapid access to a manual resuscitator or equivalent should be established before the baby is draped. Anesthesia is induced with fentanyl (usually in 1- to 5-µg aliquots) to maintain appropriate arterial pressure and perfusion. Muscle relaxation is obtained with pancuronium to prevent reduction in heart rate and preserve cardiac output. Hypotension following anesthesia induction should be anticipated, because these neonates are often on large doses of diuretics to manage their ventilation. The patient may temporarily require ventilation with 100% oxygen if SpO<sub>2</sub> drops below 90% or is associated with changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Oxygen is weaned once both lungs are allowed to expand after ductal closure. Manual ventilation is often necessary during retraction of the lung in small neonates or in those with preexisting increased oxygen requirements.

Complications include ligation of a pulmonary artery or the aorta. If  $SaO_2$  remains low and  $PETCO_2$  decreases, this alerts the perioperative team to possible pulmonary artery ligation. Similarly, placing a pulse oximeter on the foot ensures that aortic blood flow below the duct is maintained and can signal a possible aortic ligation.

In older children, PDAs are often closed in the interventional cardiac catheterization laboratory. Large PDAs or those with a short segment, however, often require intervention in the operating room under combined general and regional anesthesia. One-lung ventilation is seldom necessary because the procedure is brief.

#### Coarctation of the Aorta

Coarctation of the aorta is a common cardiac defect and in infants often is associated with anomalies of the mitral valve and left ventricular outflow tract, and with malformation of the great arteries. As with PDA, neonatal repairs are performed in critically ill patients. Coarctation in the newborn is typically associated with left ventricular dysfunction, and these patients may be receiving prostaglandins to ensure ductal patency. Usually they are also receiving mechanical ventilation and inotropic agents. Central IV, arterial, and peripheral IV catheters are normally placed for operation. Optimal placement of an arterial pressure catheter is in the right radial artery so that pressure can be monitored during aortic clamping. If right-sided arterial access is not achieved, a blood pressure cuff is placed on the right arm, and the arterial catheter in the left arm or lower extremity. Anesthesia is administered with a combination of fentanyl and an inhalation agent. During aortic clamping, proximal systemic arterial pressure is allowed to rise by 20% to 25% over baseline to optimize spinal cord perfusion. Intravascular volume loading with 10 to 20 mL · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> of crystalloid is given just before removal of the aortic clamp. The anesthetic concentration is decreased, and additional fluid is administered until arterial pressure rises. In inotrope-dependent neonates, 1 to 2 mL · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> of bicarbonate is administered before clamp release.

Avoidance of hyperthermia along with mild cooling is appropriate for patients undergoing aortic coarctation repair. Intraoperative hyperthermia has been associated with risk of spinal cord ischemia and paraplegia.C16 A target core temperature of approximately 35°C is appropriate.

In older subjects, post-repair rebound hypertension caused by heightened baroreceptor reactivity often occurs and requires therapy. After aortic clamp release, systemic hypertension is most effectively lowered by institution of β-adrenergic blockade using esmolol or combined α and β blockade with labetalol. Sodium nitroprusside may be a necessary adjunct to control refractory hypertension; however, it increases calculated ventricular wall stress in the absence of β-adrenergic blockade by accelerating dP/dt. An effective alternative to nitroprusside is the calcium channel blocker nicardipine. Again, neonates are unlikely to require or tolerate lung isolation.

#### *One-Lung Ventilation in Children*

Lung isolation is helpful during thoracoscopic procedures or unifocalization via thoracotomy or coarctation repair in older children and adolescents. Lung isolation in infants and toddlers can be achieved with endobronchial intubation or bronchial blocker. The latter can be placed under fiberoptic or fluoroscopic guidance.H2 It is Stanford's institutional preference to use a bronchial blocker rather than endobronchial intubation for lung isolation in children. The former allows expansion of the surgical side, if necessary, by deflating the blocker to improve oxygenation. Both techniques are associated with complications and should be undertaken judiciously. Lung isolation in cyanotic pediatric patients requires close communication between surgeon and anesthesiologist, as further reductions in oxygen saturation may be associated with ischemic changes on the electrocardiogram or persistent declines of ScO2.

## CONTROVERSIES IN PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIA

#### Effects of Anesthetic Medications on the Developing Brain

In the last decade, interest has focused on the role anesthesia and sedation might play in affecting the developing brain and has been the subject of considerable debate and review.C17,L8 Studies in rat pups exposed to prolonged volatile anesthetic agents resulted in learning disabilities and associated histopathologic changes in the brain. In a retrospective populationbased study, Wilder and colleagues examined the medical and school records of children born to mothers residing in Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1976 to 1982 who still lived in the community at age 5 years.W8 Of the 5357 children in this cohort, 593 received general anesthesia before age 4 years (years associated with rapid synaptogenesis) and 4764 did not (controls). A single exposure to anesthesia (*n* = 449) was not associated with learning disabilities. However, children receiving two or more anesthetics were twice as likely as controls to have learning disabilities. The risk for learning disabilities increased with longer cumulative duration of anesthesia exposure (≥120 minutes)—a dose-response relationship. Complete anesthesia records were available, and anesthetic techniques were consistent, with most children (88%) receiving halothane as a primary anesthetic. In addition, those with learning disabilities had a lower birth weight, were of younger gestational age, and were more likely to be male. Although from this study one cannot answer whether anesthesia caused learning disabilities, the repeated need for anesthesia could be a marker for them. Prospective multicenter studies are currently underway to answer whether anesthesia affects the developing brain. The findings could affect timing of complex neonatal heart surgery and should therefore be a concern for healthcare providers involved in caring for children with heart disease.

#### Blood Glucose Management in the Perioperative Period

Among infants undergoing the arterial switch operation, those who spent more than 50% of the time in a 24-hour period with blood glucose levels in the 80 to 110 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> range were at higher risk for postoperative adverse events than hyperglycemic infants with blood sugars greater than 200 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> 50% of the time.R12 A study in infants had similar results.D4

On the other hand, Polito and colleagues reported that pediatric patients with blood glucose greater than 126 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in a 72-hour period had a longer ICU stay following surgery, suggesting that hyperglycemia could be detrimental in infants as well.P4 However, all these studies were retrospective.

A placebo-controlled prospective study of 700 patients in a pediatric ICU reported that tight glycemic control resulted in shorter ICU length of stay, reduced lactate levels, decreased C-reactive protein, and reduced occurrence of infections.V4 However, occurrence of hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 40 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) was higher in the intensive insulin treatment group (25%) vs. the conventional group (1%), for whom insulin was administered only if blood glucose exceeded 200 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> on at least two occasions. The majority (80%) of patients who had hypoglycemia were infants, but those who developed hypoglycemia did not have a substantially increased risk of mortality. No early neurologic abnormalities were detected related to either hyper- or hypoglycemia. More studies of

this nature with long-term follow-up are required before insulin infusion and tight glycemic control can be recommended routinely in children during and after heart surgery.
