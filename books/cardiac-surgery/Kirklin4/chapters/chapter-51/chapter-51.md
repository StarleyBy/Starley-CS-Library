## **Section I Vascular Ring**

## DEFINITION

*Vascular ring* is a congenital anomaly in which the aortic arch and its branches completely or incompletely encircle and compress the trachea or esophagus or both.

## HISTORICAL NOTE

Double aortic arch was apparently first described by Hommel in 1737 (cited by Turner) and a century later by Von Siebold.T4,V2 Wolman is credited with describing the syndrome of tracheal and esophageal compression produced by a double arch in 1939.W6 A description of a patient with dysphagia thought to be due to a retroesophageal right subclavian artery was published in 1794 by Bayford, although the vessel was illustrated to pass between the esophagus and trachea rather than in its actual position posterior to the esophagus.B10,B11

Modern interest in these anomalies was prompted by the first surgical correction of a double aortic arch by Gross in 1945.G5 Subsequently, he pioneered surgical treatment of most other forms of vascular ring.G6,G8,G9 The basis for radiologic diagnosis was initially described by Neuhauser.N3

The complex development and regression of the aortic arches during fetal development was elucidated by Congdon in 1922, but until Gross's pioneering surgical work, this information was little used by clinicians.C6 In 1948, Edwards introduced the hypothetical double aortic arch scheme to conceptualize the numerous anomalies of the arch complex.E1 This was further elaborated by Kirklin and Clagett in 1950K3 and by Stewart, Kincaid, and Edwards in 1964.S6 In 1951, Barry provided a clear anatomic summary and review of Congdon's basic work.B9 In 1999, Momma and colleagues, followed by McElhinney and colleagues, identified chromosome 22q11 deletions associated with isolated anomalies of laterality or branching of the aortic arch.M3,M5

#### MORPHOLOGY

Variations in arrangement of the ascending, transverse, and descending aorta and its branches are numerous in patients with vascular rings. Several of these may produce compression of the trachea or esophagus, or both, and are of surgical importance. They may be grouped as (1) complete or (2) incomplete vascular rings, including compression by the brachiocephalic artery or left common carotid artery (Box 51-1).B6 Of 301 patients with vascular ring or sling reported by Backer and Mavroudis, 84% fit into the categories of double aortic arch (30%), right arch with retroesophageal component (27%), and brachiocephalic artery compression syndrome (27%).B5

#### Complete Vascular Ring

## *Double Aortic Arch*

In patients with double aortic arch, the ascending aorta arises normally, but as it leaves the pericardium it divides into two branches, a left and right aortic arch, that join posteriorly to form the descending aorta. The left arch passes anteriorly and

**Figure 51-1** Double aortic arch with right dominant arch. Right common carotid and right subclavian arteries arise from right arch. Left common carotid and left subclavian arteries arise from smaller left arch. The two arches join as the descending thoracic aorta, forming a complete vascular ring.

to the left of the trachea in the usual position and is joined by the ductus arteriosus (or more often a ligamentum arteriosum), where it becomes the descending aorta. The right aortic arch passes to the right and then posterior to the esophagus to join the left-sided descending aorta, thus completing the vascular ringE2 (Fig. 51-1). Occasionally the descending aorta is right sided, in which case the left arch (or its remnant) passes behind the esophagus. This was the case in 13 of 19 cases reported by Lincoln and colleagues.L3 Alternatively, the descending aorta may be essentially a midline structure.

The right arch gives origin to two vessels, the right common carotid and right subclavian arteries, and the left arch gives origin to the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries in that order. The right aortic arch is most often

(75% of cases)A3 larger (right dominant) than the left, which usually becomes narrow or atretic in its distal part beyond the origin of the left subclavian artery (Fig. 51-2; see also Fig. 51-1). This portion may remain patent or be represented by a fibrous chord that joins the descending aorta,

often at the site of a diverticulum.S9 This fibrous chord, at its origin from the base of the left subclavian artery, lies close to the ligamentum arteriosum. The latter structure passes from this point to the adjacent proximal part of the left pulmonary artery (Fig. 51-3; double arch, left dominant). Less commonly (20% of cases) the left aortic arch is larger (left dominant) than the right, which although smaller in its distal part after the origin of the right subclavian artery, is rarely atretic (Fig. 51-4; see also Fig. 51-3). Size of the right and left aortic arches is nearly equal (balanced) in about 5% of cases.B7

Associated cardiovascular anomalies are uncommon but include tetralogy of Fallot and transposition of the great arteries.H7,S6

#### *Right Aortic Arch with Retroesophageal Component*

In the situation of right aortic arch with a retroesophageal vascular or ligamentous component, a vascular ring is usually present, but the anatomic details vary depending on site of regression (interruption) of the embryonic left arch.

In the common situation of right aortic arch without retroesophageal segment, no vascular ring is present. The arch branches arise in mirror image of the normal (Fig. 51-5).D1 This arrangement is the result of interruption of the embryonic left arch distal to the ductus arteriosus, in which the anterior ligamentum courses from the brachiocephalic artery to the proximal left pulmonary artery (Fig. 51-6, *A*, type 1 right aortic arch). This type is particularly common in tetralogy of Fallot (see Chapter 38) and truncus arteriosus (see Chapter 43).

**Mirror-Image Branching and Retroesophageal Ligamentum Arteriosum** Interruption of the left arch is proximal (upstream) to the ductus arteriosus (Fig. 51-6, *B*, type 2 right aortic arch). The left-sided ligamentum arteriosum extends from a diverticulum (Kommerell) on the upper descending thoracic aorta, behind the esophagus, forward to the left pulmonary artery. The vascular ring is formed by the ascending portion of the right arch and brachiocephalic artery anteriorly, by the aortic diverticulum posteriorly, and by the ligamentum arteriosum laterally.K4 In the surgical series reported by Backer and colleagues, this anomaly represented about one third of right arch vascular rings.B7

**Retroesophageal Left Subclavian Artery and Ligamentum (Ductus) Arteriosum** Here the interruption of the left arch occurs between the left subclavian and left common carotid arteries (Fig. 51-6, *C*, type 3 right aortic arch). The first branch of the right arch becomes the left common

carotid artery, and the descending aorta gives origin to the retroesophageal left subclavian artery as the fourth branch. The ductus or ligament arises with the left subclavian artery from an aortic diverticulum or from the left subclavian artery itself near its origin, where the subclavian artery may be narrowed. The descending aorta can be left or right sided.

This is the most common type of vascular ring associated with right arch (see Fig. 51-6, *C*), accounting for about two thirds of right arch vascular rings.B7 It is usually loose, so compression of either the esophagus or trachea is uncommon. Associated cardiac anomalies are rare.

**Retroesophageal Left Brachiocephalic Artery** Here interruption occurs between the left common carotid and the right arch (Fig. 51-6, *D*, type 4 right aortic arch). A vascular ring is present, but the anomaly is rare. Bein and colleagues reported a case of long-segment coarctation with this anomaly.B12

#### *Left Aortic Arch and Right Descending Aorta*

Vascular rings are likely in the uncommon combination of left aortic arch and right descending aorta. The left arch crosses behind the esophagus. In combination with right patent ductus arteriosus or ligamentum arteriosum, a vascular ring is formed.B14,M8,P1

#### *Cervical Aortic Arch Complex*

Cervical aortic arch is a developmental entity consisting of persistence of the right or left third branchial arch and regression of the fourth branchial arch.V3 The cervical aortic arch complex consists of a cervical position of the apex of the aortic arch with separate origin of the contralateral carotid artery, a retroesophageal descending aorta coursing contralaterally to the arch, and anomalous origin of the subclavian artery from the descending aorta.H4 The cervical arch usually

**Figure 51-6** Vascular ring associated with right aortic arch. Center drawing depicts a double aortic arch with descending thoracic aorta as a midline or left-sided structure. Ligamentum arteriosum *(dashed line)* is shown originating from junction of right or left arch and descending aorta. Right-sided ligamentum arteriosum to right pulmonary artery usually forms in association with a right-sided descending aorta. Left-sided ligamentum arteriosum is the common configuration connecting midline or left descending thoracic aorta to left pulmonary artery near bifurcation. The four possible sites *(dotted lines)* of regression (interruption) of left arch during fetal development are shown. Various types of right aortic arch are depicted depending on site of interruption. Vascular ring results from a retroesophageal component of left arch giving rise to the ligamentum. **A,** Type 1 right aortic arch. Aortic arch branches arise in mirror image of normal. Anterior ligamentum arteriosum courses from brachiocephalic artery to proximal left pulmonary artery (see Fig. 51-5). There is no vascular ring. **B,** Type 2 right aortic arch. Left arch regresses just distal to left subclavian artery, leaving a retroesophageal aortic diverticulum. Ligamentum (ductus) arteriosum arises posteriorly from descending aorta and courses to left pulmonary artery, completing a vascular ring. **C,** Type 3 right aortic arch. Left arch regresses between left common carotid and left subclavian arteries, leaving a retroesophageal subclavian artery, with ligamentum (ductus) arteriosum forming a complete vascular ring. **D,** Type 4 right aortic arch. Left arch regresses between right arch and left common carotid artery. Complete vascular ring is present in this rare anomaly.

is right sided. The aorta is usually redundant and crosses to the opposite side posterior to the esophagus. The retroesophageal segment of the aorta may be tortuous and severely narrowed.H4 A vascular ring is formed when there is an aberrant subclavian artery on the side contralateral to the aortic arch and a ligamentum arteriosum. There is considerable variability in anatomic configuration of the aortic arch and its branches.M7 Abnormalities of brachiocephalic arterial branching and arch laterality are common in patients with cervical aortic arch.M4 Vascular ring is frequently present, usually formed by the right aortic arch and aberrant left subclavian artery, but occasionally by double aortic arch. Rarely, a left cervical aortic arch, right ligamentum arteriosum, and right descending aorta form the vascular ring (see also discussion under "Left Aortic Arch and Right Descending Aorta").W3

## Incomplete Vascular Ring

## *Left Aortic Arch and Retroesophageal Right Subclavian Artery*

The relatively common (0.5% of the general populationA1) retroesophageal right subclavian artery arising as the fourth branch of an otherwise normal aortic arch and passing upward and to the right behind the esophagus was once thought to be a cause of dysphagia (dysphagia lusoria, or "difficulty swallowing due to a trick of nature").B4,L3,M10 This condition does not form a complete ring and is generally not considered the true cause of vague symptoms related to swallowing. Rarely, a right ligamentum arteriosum passing from the retroesophageal right subclavian artery to the right pulmonary artery forms a vascular ring that is symptomatic.

## *Tracheal Compression by Brachiocephalic or Left Common Carotid Artery*

The brachiocephalic or left common carotid artery may be drawn taut across the anterior wall of the trachea, a potential but uncommon cause of respiratory obstruction.A2,E3,F1,L3,M9 It is not known why they occasionally compress the trachea. Presumably, the brachiocephalic artery originates more posteriorly from the aortic arch than usual, so it crosses the trachea more posteriorly.A4

### *Ductus Arteriosus Sling*

Binet and colleagues described an infant with respiratory obstruction in which an anomalous vessel (presumed to be the ductus arteriosus) originated from the right pulmonary artery, crossed to the left between the esophagus and trachea, and joined the descending aorta adjacent to the origin of a retroesophageal right subclavian artery.B15

## *Severe Malrotation of Heart with Patent Ductus Arteriosus*

Compression of the lower trachea can occur with a normal left arch when there is severe malrotation of the heart into the right chest in association with agenesis or hypoplasia of the right lung.V1,W2 Scherer and Westcott described a patient with dextrocardia and normal lungs in whom the pulmonary trunk lay anterior to the trachea and somewhat to the right. The patent ductus arteriosus connecting with a normally positioned descending aorta pulled the pulmonary trunk backward, compressing the front of the trachea. Compression was relieved by dividing the patent ductus arteriosus.S3

## CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

## Symptoms and Signs

Symptoms of vascular ring relate to the consequences of tracheal and esophageal compression.A4,M10,W8 Presentation is usually within the first 6 months of life and often within the first month. Inspiratory stridor may be present at birth, often in association with an expiratory wheeze and tachypnea. Stridor may be worse in various positions—for example, when the baby is lying on his or her back rather than side. Often, stridor is relieved by extending the neck. The baby's cry may be hoarse and, in the absence of frank stridor, the breathing noisy. Persistent barking cough is frequently present. There may be episodes of apnea, severe cyanosis, and unconsciousness. When obstruction is severe, subcostal retraction is obvious. Recurrent respiratory infections are common and aggravate the respiratory obstruction; when obstruction is less severe, obstructive symptoms may be apparent only at such times.

The baby often feeds poorly, and there may be obvious difficulty in swallowing liquids, with episodes of choking and increased respiratory obstruction at these times. Dysphagia for solids is common (most severe cases are operated on before the babies are old enough to be offered solid food), with the baby refusing to swallow them or choking and regurgitating.

Dysphagia lusoria is often attributed to retroesophageal origin of the right subclavian artery from the upper descending thoracic aorta.B4,L3,M10 The artery courses to the right, posterior to the esophagus, producing an indentation of the esophagus that has been blamed for vague symptoms in children, but that is usually not the cause. Should it become ectatic or aneurysmal later in life, difficulty swallowing is more likely.

Symptomatic vascular rings manifesting in adults are rare, and reports often emphasize dysphagia as the predominant symptom. Grathwohl and colleaguesG10 reviewed case reports of 24 adults with vascular rings. Two thirds had symptoms, 63% respiratory. Dysphagia was less prominent, occurring in 33%. Vascular rings occurring in adults may mimic chronic asthma.H5,P2

#### Chest Radiography

Plain chest radiograph in the frontal view is either normal (10%) or shows a right aortic arch (85%).P5 Anterior tracheal bowing is present on 92% of lateral views, and tracheal narrowing on 77%.

#### Esophagography

The esophagram is a useful diagnostic measure.A4,L3 Video esophagography at the time of cineangiography is optimal because it permits a detailed study showing the pulsatile nature of the obstruction and trachea.

With double aortic arch, the esophagram shows left- and right-sided indentations, with that for the right arch usually higher and deeper (Fig. 51-7, *A*). In addition, the retroesophageal component produces a prominent posterior indentation that courses downward and to the left. In contrast, a retroesophageal left subclavian artery arising from the right arch produces a narrower esophageal impression that

courses upward and rightward. Right arch and left ligamentum arteriosum show more marked right-sided than left-sided indentation (Fig. 51-7, *B*).

#### Bronchoscopy

Bronchoscopy is rarely done, although it does identify sites of tracheal compression and shows its pulsatile nature.M10

#### Two-Dimensional Echocardiography

Two-dimensional echocardiography is useful in diagnosing vascular ring, at least in neonates and infants, and is critically important for identifying associated cardiac anomalies.B17 However, it is inferior to computed tomography (CT) in demonstrating details of arch anatomy.

#### Computed Tomography

CT with contrast usually provides an excellent image of the structures and complements two-dimensional echocardiography. Ultrafast CT with three-dimensional reconstruction provides even greater anatomic detail.V4 In many institutions, CT has become the standard modality for delineating details of vascular ring anatomy.B7

#### Magnetic Resonance Imaging

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is diagnostic and delineates severity of tracheal narrowing.S4

#### Aortography

Because of the accuracy of noninvasive imaging, aortography is rarely necessary. Aortography may be performed via a catheter positioned in the ascending aorta and is usually combined with cineangiography to assess associated congenital cardiac anomalies. Using biplane techniques, the first injection depicts both lateral and anteroposterior views, and the second both left and right oblique views. A degree of cranial tilt may separate the arches better in oblique views.T1 Aortography can establish that the anomaly is a complete double aortic arch and show sites of narrowing in the left or (rarely) right arch (see Figs. 51-2 and 51-4). It cannot distinguish between a double arch with an atretic segment and a right aortic arch with a retroesophageal component. Sharp angulation of one of the brachiocephalic arteries may indicate the site of an atretic segment in a double arch or a constricting ligamentum arteriosum in a right arch with retroesophageal component (Fig. 51-8).

#### NATURAL HISTORY

Vascular rings of aortic arch origin account for 1% to 2% of cases of congenital heart disease.N1 Only fragmentary information exists concerning the natural history of these anomalies. Untreated severe respiratory obstruction in the first 6 months of life is presumably fatal before age 1 year, particularly when symptoms are present from birth. Symptoms first appearing after age 6 months are less severe and rarely progressive, except at times of respiratory infection or regurgitation and choking.

When symptoms are of borderline severity, they usually disappear as the child grows. Godtfredsen and colleagues followed 11 patients with symptoms not severe enough to justify surgery.G3 Of the six who had either double aortic arch or right arch with retroesophageal component, four outgrew their symptoms by age 4 years, and two with persistent symptoms had other anomalies to explain them.

**Figure 51-8** Aortogram of right aortic arch with retroesophageal left subclavian artery and ligamentum arteriosum arising from a retroesophageal aortic diverticulum. Frontal views **(A-B)** and right anterior oblique views **(C-D)** are at different phases in cardiac cycle. Angulation at origin of left subclavian artery from diverticulum suggests presence of a ligamentum arteriosum under tension passing forward to left pulmonary artery (as was the case at operation). Angulation is downward in frontal view and anterior in right anterior oblique view. Absence of a similar angulation along course of left common carotid artery suggests that this artery is not connected to the diverticulum by an atretic ligament that forms part of a complete left aortic arch.

**Figure 51-9** Operative repair of vascular ring caused by right dominant double aortic arch. **A,** Surgeon's view of anomaly through left posterolateral thoracotomy. Both arches, their branches, and ligamentum arteriosum are dissected and separated thoroughly from surrounding tissues. Site of division of smaller left arch is shown by dashed line. **B,** Ligamentum arteriosum is divided between surgical clips. Aortic arch is divided and ends ligated or oversewn. Anteromedial surface of aorta is dissected away from esophagus. Adventitia of lateral wall of aorta is sutured to periosteum of an adjacent rib to pull aorta laterally and posteriorly away from esophagus.

Generally, symptoms are milder and of later onset, and dysphagia is less prominent, in patients having right aortic arch with retroesophageal component than in those with double aortic arch.A4

## TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

## Double Aortic Arch

In all cases of double aortic arch with a left-sided ligamentum, the repair may be approached through a left thoracotomy via the fourth interspace or bed of the nonresected fifth rib, as in the operation for patent ductus arteriosus (see Chapter 37, Fig. 37-3) or coarctation (see Chapter 48, Fig. 48-15). However, a similar approach from the right side may also be used when the left arch is dominant. Median sternotomy may be used when coexisting cardiac anomalies require repair.

When the left arch is dominant, the right arch can be dissected out via a left-sided approach, including the part passing behind the esophagus, and is divided between clamps close to its junction with the descending aorta. Its ends are oversewn with two rows of 4-0 or 5-0 polypropylene sutures. Its mediastinal surface is then dissected further to free it and allow the divided ends to separate. The descending aorta is also mobilized and sometimes sutured to the rib periosteum to keep it away from the esophagus. In this and other operations for relief of vascular rings, "all strands or bands of tissue which form a part of the constricting mechanism" must be dissected away from the trachea or esophagus.G7 Operation is completed by closing the chest wound in layers after inserting a single intercostal tube for drainage.

More often, the distal left arch is narrowed, and approach is made from the left side. The vascular structures and ligamentum arteriosum are dissected out and separated thoroughly from surrounding structures (Fig. 51-9, *A*). The ligamentum arteriosum is divided, taking care to avoid injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The junction of the left arch with the descending aorta is divided between vascular clamps and the ends oversewn (Fig. 51-9, *B*). The end of the left arch is then further dissected from underlying mediastinal tissues to allow it to retract forward. The medial surface of the descending aorta and distal divided end are also dissected

away from the esophagus. Adventitia over the lateral wall of the aorta may be sutured to the adjacent rib periosteum to pull it laterally and posteriorly away from the esophagus.

Techniques have been developed to divide vascular rings using video-assisted thoracoscopy.B18 Compared with standard thoracotomy techniques, it is equally safe (no mortality), and length of stay in the intensive care unit or hospital, duration of intubation, and hospital charges are similar.

#### Right Aortic Arch with Retroesophageal Component

Right arch with retroesophageal component is generally approached from the left side. After dissection is completed, the ligamentum arteriosum is divided. The aortic diverticulum (Kommerell) is resected when it is large enough to independently compress the esophagus or trachea.B4 Backer and colleagues recommend routine reimplantation of the left subclavian artery into the left common carotid artery if it arises from the diverticulum (Fig. 51-10). The descending aorta is dissected away from the esophagus and sutured to the periosteum of the rib if necessary to keep it away from the esophagus.

A robotic approach for dividing a left-sided ligamentum has been reported in a type 4 right aortic arch vascular ring.R2

#### Left Aortic Arch

Right-sided thoracotomy is used for left aortic arch and rightsided ligamentum arteriosumP7,W3 with or without a retroesophageal right subclavian artery (Fig. 51-11). The ligamentum is dissected and divided in the same fashion as for right arch with retroesophageal component.

## Tracheal Compression by Brachiocephalic or Left Common Carotid Artery

arch associated with severe rightward malrotation of the heart, approach may be through a median sternotomy. A short left anterolateral thoracotomy also works well and leaves the sternum intact; the suspending sutures may be passed through the sternum. The anomalous vessel is fully dissected, then suspended from the posterior aspect of the sternum or adjacent ribs with 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene pledgeted mattress sutures that pick up the adventitia of the vessel.

Hawkins and colleagues have proposed an alternative midline approach in which the brachiocephalic artery is reimplanted more proximally on the ascending aorta and to the right of the trachea.H2

#### SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Few patients obtain immediate relief of stridor,L3 but for some the improvement in breathing is prompt and dramatic. Symptoms may worsen in the first postoperative week in some patients. Special respiratory care is therefore required, particularly in small infants. Occasionally, intubation is necessary for several days to allow adequate tracheal aspiration toilet and, if necessary, ventilation. Use of continuous positive airway pressure with the infant breathing spontaneously is often advantageous in this setting.S7 After extubation, positive pressure is maintained for some days if necessary, using nasal prongs with an appropriate flow of humidified gas. Full humidification and meticulous suctioning techniques are required to keep the airway clear and avoid mucosal damage.

## RESULTS

## Complete Vascular Ring

In the current era, hospital mortality after repair of vascular ring without major associated lesions should approach zero.A3,H9,R3,R4 Good functional results are obtained in 90% of surviving patients.B3 In a 45-year analysis by Backer and colleagues, early mortality was primarily related to major associated cardiac or respiratory anomalies.

Late outcomes after repair of complete vascular ring are generally good, but persistent respiratory symptoms are frequent—54% after repair of double aortic arch in a longitudinal study by Alsenaidi and colleagues,A3 possibly associated with previous compression-related tracheobronchial damage or maldevelopment. Gastrointestinal symptoms are uncommon.A3

## Incomplete Vascular Ring

Results are also good in about 90% of patients with incomplete vascular ring.B3

## *Tracheal Compression by Brachiocephalic or Left Common Carotid Artery*

Results of arteriopexy for tracheal compression by the brachiocephalic or left common carotid artery were excellent in 93% of a group of 76 patients.B1 Death occurred in 3 of 79 (3%; CL 1.7%-7.5%) patients.B4 Similar results have been achieved by the reimplantation technique.H2

## INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Operation is indicated in all patients with important obstructed airway symptoms. Treatment should not be delayed, because hypoxic and apneic spells may occur, as well as further damage to the trachea and bronchi.B4 Operation is not indicated if symptoms are mild or absent.

## SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

#### Resection of Kommerell Diverticulum

Most surgeons have routinely left alone a Kommerell diverticulum or performed an aortopexy in the vicinity of the diverticulum by tacking it to the adjacent chest wall. However, Backer and colleagues recommend its routine excision (see Technique of Operation) because of the occasional need to reoperate for symptom recurrence secondary to tracheoesophageal compression by the diverticulum.B7 Further longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the role of routine diverticular resection.

# **Section II Vascular Sling**

## DEFINITION

*Vascular sling* is a congenital anomaly in which the left pulmonary artery (LPA) arises from the right pulmonary artery (RPA) extrapericardially (anomalous LPA), courses to the left

![](_page_12_Figure_2.jpeg)

behind the tracheal bifurcation and in front of the esophagus to reach the left lung hilum, and forms a sling around the trachea.

## HISTORICAL NOTE

Anomalous LPA was first recognized by Glaevecke and Doehle in 1897 during an autopsy performed on a 7-monthold child who died of asphyxia.G2 The next report was that of Scheid in 1938, again in the German literature and again from autopsy findings, this time in a 7-month-old child who died of respiratory obstruction.S2 Description of the anomalous origin and course of the artery is accurate in both reports, but Scheid also described in detail an associated diffuse tracheal stenosis caused by presence of complete cartilaginous rings. This latter condition was again accurately described by Wolman 3 years later.W7

Quist-Hanssen from Norway detailed the clinical findings of pulmonary artery sling premortem in 1949, although exact diagnosis was not made until autopsy.Q1 Welsh and Munro first suggested, based on their autopsy findings, that in this anomaly the barium swallow should show an anterior esophageal indentation; Wittenborg and colleagues soon after accurately defined these features on an esophagram.W1,W5 In 1980, Stone and colleaguesS8 described diagnosis by CT, and in 1988, Malmgren and colleagues by MRI.M1

In 1958, Contro and colleagues coined the term *vascular sling* to distinguish the condition from vascular ring.C8 Much later, Berdon and colleagues introduced the phrase *ringsling complex* to emphasize the often coexisting tracheal anomaly.B13

In 1954, Potts and colleagues were the first to report successful operation in a patient in whom the anatomy of the malformation was not established before operation. Potts divided the LPA at its origin from the RPA, transferred the vessel in front of the trachea, and reanastomosed it to the proximal stump.P6 Soon after, Morse and Gladding reported a case diagnosed at right thoracotomy and confirmed at autopsy, in which the anomalous LPA was dissected away (but not divided) from the trachea in an attempt to relieve compression.M6

Hiller and Maclean operated successfully on a patient correctly diagnosed by barium swallow and angiography in 1955; after mobilizing and dividing the anomalous LPA, they anastomosed it to the side of the pulmonary trunk (the operation currently practiced). The patient's stridor was relieved completely, and the chest radiograph was normal. However, angiogram 3 weeks later showed LPA occlusion.H8 In 1962, Mustard and colleagues reported relief of respiratory obstruction following division of the ligamentum arteriosum only.M10 One year later, Lochard and colleagues reported a case in which the right mainstem bronchus was successfully relocated in front of the anomalous LPA.L4 Neither of the latter two procedures is practiced currently. An approach through a median sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was described by Kirklin in 1986K2 and subsequently by others.C7 Single-stage repair of pulmonary artery sling and tracheal stenosis was reported in 1983 by Campbell and colleagues and in 1987 by Hickey and Wood.H6 Treatment in one stage by excision of tracheal stenosis and simple anterior relocation of the LPA was reported in 1989.J2

## MORPHOLOGY

#### Anomalous Left Pulmonary Artery

The anomalous LPA arises extrapericardially from the posterosuperior wall of a normally positioned RPA lying in front of the proximal right main bronchus. The RPA is a direct continuation of the pulmonary trunk, the junction between them marked by attachment of the ligamentum arteriosum (or ductus arteriosus). From its point of origin, the LPA curves upward and backward over the proximal right main bronchus, then to the left behind the lower trachea and its bifurcation at or slightly above the carinaJ3 (Fig. 51-13). It courses slightly inferior to lie behind the proximal left mainstem bronchus, then appears immediately superior to it to enter the left lung, and then divides. The left lung hilum is lower than normal in relation to the pulmonary trunk.C2 The LPA usually indents the posterior wall of the trachea and left main bronchus as it passes behind them and displaces (bows) the distal trachea and carina toward the left. The right main bronchus is bowed anteriorly.C2 The LPA passes in front of the esophagus, which is usually indented across its entire anterior aspect or, less often, on its leftward anterior surface only.

The anomalous LPA is frequently slightly smaller than normal (see Chapter 1). Rarely, the *right* upper lobe artery comes off the LPA near its origin.T3 Bamman and colleagues described one case in which the left lung was partly supplied by an LPA in normal position; the anomalous LPA supplied only the left lower lobe and crossed behind the left atrium rather than behind the tracheal bifurcation.B8

The ligamentum arteriosum (or ductus arteriosus) follows a normal course from the junction of the pulmonary trunk RPA, passing backward directly superior to the left main bronchus and anomalous LPA (not between them as depicted by Williams and colleagues) to join the descending aorta.W4 It may participate with the anomalous LPA in forming a vascular ring.

#### Tracheobronchial and Pulmonary Abnormalities

The trachea near the bifurcation is usually narrowed as a result of posterior compression by the anomalous LPA. This mainly affects the origin of the right main bronchus and trachea just above the carina.J3 Rarely, the left main bronchus may be narrowed by a similar mechanism.

In about 50% of patients, narrowing of the trachea or proximal main bronchi is secondary to presence of complete ring cartilages (ring-sling complex),L1,N2 which often are more numerous than normal.S1,S2 In these areas, the pars membranacea is absent and the lumen is usually severely narrowed. This process may involve the entire length of the trachea or only its proximal or distal portions. The major bronchi may be similarly involved, or their cartilaginous rings may be wide and irregular and the bronchi variable in diameter and length.C5

The so-called bronchus suis, consisting of separate high origin from the trachea of the right superior lobar bronchus to the right upper lobe, is more frequent than normal.A5 It is not itself a cause of obstruction.

When the right main bronchus is selectively narrowed, there is hyperinflation of the right lung (not affecting the right upper lobe when there is a bronchus suis present); when

the left main bronchus is narrowed, there is hyperinflation of the left lung.A5 More complete obstruction leads to atelectasis. When obstruction of the right main bronchus is important in utero, there may be retention of fetal fluid in the right lung at birth.

Either the left or right lung may be unilobar.S1 Rarely, the right lung may be hypoplastic.H1 The lung hypoplasia may be part of scimitar syndrome.

#### Other Cardiovascular Anomalies

Other cardiovascular anomalies coexist with half the cases of anomalous LPA.S1 Most common are left superior vena cava, atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, and ventricular septal defect. There may also be tetralogy of Fallot, single ventricle, transposition of the great arteries, tricuspid atresia, or aortic arch anomalies.

#### Noncardiovascular Developmental Anomalies

A variety of noncardiovascular developmental anomalies coexist relatively frequently.C4

## CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

#### Symptoms and Signs

Symptoms of vascular sling relate to the consequences of tracheal and esophageal compression.M10 Up to 90% of patients have important and usually severe symptoms that develop soon after birth.C4,S1

The most common presentation is with wheezing and stridor, often with prolongation of the expiratory phase, suggesting asthma, and with a harsh cough and intercostal indrawing. In addition, there may be choking and rapid breathing or apneic spells and associated episodes of cyanosis. Symptoms are episodic, but acute episodes of dyspnea and cyanosis or severe exacerbations of respiratory obstruction are common and may result in unconsciousness, convulsions, or even death. In severe cases, hypercapnia and right lung emphysema requiring mechanical ventilation may be present from birth.O1

Symptoms may be precipitated by respiratory infections and are occasionally altered by changes in posture of the infant. They may be made worse by feeding, with or without regurgitation and choking.Q1,W5 Dysphagia, however, is uncommon.

## Chest Radiography

Plain chest radiograph gives important clues to correct diagnosis.C2 It shows anterior bowing of the right main bronchus and deviation of the lower trachea and carina to the left. In addition, the left lung hilum is lower than normal in relation to position of the pulmonary trunk, and unequal aeration of the lungs frequently is present. Usually the right lung is overinflated, but sometimes the left may be.A5 When obstruction is more complete, there may be areas of atelectasis. There is mediastinal density between the trachea and esophagus on the lateral view and, in older patients in particular, right-sided mediastinal density opposite the carina in the posteroanterior view.H8,K1,M2

In newborns, the initial chest radiograph may show retention of fetal fluid in the right lung, evidenced by a uniform opacity without loss of volume (this is in fact increased) and without an air bronchogram. Once the fetal fluid has been resorbed or suctioned off, the lung will appear hyperinflated.Z1

**Figure 51-14** Esophagram (lateral) of anomalous left pulmonary artery. Prominent indentation of anterior wall of esophagus is seen immediately above tracheal bifurcation.

#### Esophagography

Barium swallow usually shows an anterior indentation of the esophagus in the *lateral* view just above the level of the carina (Fig. 51-14). In the anteroposterior view, there may be no abnormality or a leftward lateral indentation.G12,S5 The only other conditions known to produce an anterior esophageal indentation at this level are the ductus arteriosus sling (see "Ductus Arteriosus Sling" under Morphology in Section I) and a long, tortuous patent ductus arteriosus.B15,B16

In patients with anomalous LPA, these findings are not necessarily present and are variable in their appearance during the esophagram, because they are in part dependent on the phase of the cardiac and respiratory cycles.B16,D2,W5 Highquality video barium swallow is therefore required. The esophagram can be more difficult to interpret when there is also a retroesophageal subclavian artery passing posterior to the esophagus at a slightly higher level than the LPA.W5

#### Noninvasive Imaging

In most patients, diagnosis can be made by two-dimensional echocardiography, CT with contrast, or MRI.R1,S8 A tracheogram or a tracheal CT study should be made to evaluate the additional zones of narrowing that are frequently present and influence surgical management.C2,C3 It is best done in conjunction with video esophageal studies.

Concavity apparent in upper surface of left pulmonary artery just lateral to the ductus is impression of descending aorta. **B,** Late postoperative study showing stenosis at anastomosis of left pulmonary artery to pulmonary trunk. This was successfully treated by percutaneous balloon dilatation.

#### Bronchoscopy

Bronchoscopy is required in all patients to evaluate tracheal abnormalities (complete tracheal rings) and identify areas of stenosis that may need surgical repair and affect airway and ventilatory management.

## Cardiac Catheterization and Angiography

Cardiac catheterization and angiography display the anomaly well, can confirm diagnosis (Fig. 51-15), and demonstrate associated cardiovascular anomalies. The LPA is visualized best in a cranially tilted frontal view.

## NATURAL HISTORY

Vascular sling is a rare condition. The largest series includes 15 patients accumulated over 45 years in a high-volume children's hospital.B4 Therefore, information about natural history is incomplete.

## TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

Repair is advantageously performed through a median sternotomy using CPB,K2 although it can be done through a left thoracotomy.G10,G11

## Reimplantation of Left Pulmonary Artery

## *With Cardiopulmonary Bypass*

After usual preparations and bronchoscopy (if not previously performed) and median sternotomy, the pericardium is opened and retraction sutures applied. The aorta is dissected completely away from both pulmonary arteries. The ligamentum arteriosum, which is often stretched tightly across the carina and is part of the vascular sling, is dissected and divided between ligatures. The decision is then made either to reimplant the LPA or excise a tracheal stenosis (if this exists), move the dissected but undivided LPA anteriorly, and reconstruct the trachea end to end.

When the tracheal rings are normal and no tracheal stenosis or softening is demonstrated, CPB is established using a single venous cannula and a perfusate temperature of about 32°C (see Chapter 2). The left pleural space is opened widely, either then or later. The LPA is identified coming off the RPA. It is dissected out well distally, completely separating it from surrounding structures, including the trachea anteriorly and the esophagus posteriorly. The plane of dissection must be on the adventitia of the LPA to avoid damage to the membranous portion of the trachea (Fig. 51-16, *A*). The LPA is cut away from the RPA, and the defect in the latter is closed with two rows of 5-0 or 6-0 polypropylene sutures. The LPA is then pulled out into the left pleural space. A large window is made in the pericardium behind the phrenic nerve and alongside the pulmonary trunk, and the LPA is brought into the pericardial space through it. An incision is made in the left lateral aspect of the pulmonary trunk. Taking care that the LPA lies nicely without kinking or rotation, its proximal end is anastomosed to the side of the pulmonary trunk with continuous 6-0 or 7-0 polypropylene suture (Fig. 51-16, *B*).

After rewarming the patient, CPB is discontinued and cannulae removed. A polyvinyl pressure-recording catheter may be brought out from the pulmonary trunk via the right ventricle. The remainder of the operation is completed as usual.

## *Without Cardiopulmonary Bypass*

A left posterolateral thoracotomy is made, entering the chest via the fourth interspace or fifth rib bed. Alternatively, some have preferred median sternotomy. The anomalous LPA is identified by dissecting the superior part of the left lung hilum (Fig. 51-17, *A*). The ligamentum arteriosum is divided because this improves exposure and may possibly relieve

**Figure 51-16** Repair of anomalous left pulmonary artery (LPA) using cardiopulmonary bypass. Operation is performed via median sternotomy. **A,** Aorta is mobilized off right pulmonary artery and anomalous origin of LPA, which is extrapericardial, and is retracted toward the left. LPA is divided *(dashed line).* Arteriotomy is made on left lateral aspect of pulmonary trunk *(dashed line).* **B,** Proximal end of LPA is ligated or oversewn.

compression of the left main bronchus.M10 Dissection of the LPA is continued medially (centrally) and behind the proximal left main bronchus and tracheal bifurcation. The artery is freed completely from the posterior wall of these structures and followed as far as possible into the mediastinum to gain adequate length. Care is taken not to obstruct flow into the RPA by undue tension on the LPA. The patient is given heparin (1.5 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) to obtain systemic anticoagulant effect. The LPA is then divided between vascular clamps, its proximal end on the RPA oversewn with continuous 6-0 or 7-0 polypropylene suture, and the clamp removed (Fig. 51-17, *B*).

![](_page_17_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 51-17** Repair of anomalous left pulmonary artery (LPA) without cardiopulmonary bypass. Operation is performed through posterolateral thoracotomy on left side. **A,** Ligamentum arteriosum is mobilized (or divided). Anomalous LPA is dissected from hilum of left lung to its origin from right pulmonary artery, separating it completely from posterior surface of trachea and surrounding tissues. LPA is divided near its origin *(dashed line)* after isolation under a partial occlusion vascular clamp. Arteriotomy *(dashed line)* is made in left lateral aspect of pulmonary trunk, isolated using a partial occlusion vascular clamp (clamp not shown for clarity of illustration). **B,** Proximal end of LPA is ligated or oversewn. Ligamentum arteriosum is ligated and divided. LPA is withdrawn from behind trachea and anastomosed to pulmonary trunk.

The pericardium is opened with a vertical incision anterior to the phrenic nerve to expose the pulmonary trunk, and a second similar incision is made posterior to this structure, through which the distal end of the anomalous LPA is passed. The tip of the left atrial appendage is retracted by a ligature tied to it, and the left wall of the pulmonary trunk is excluded in a curved vascular clamp. The clamp is positioned to allow the LPA to reach the pulmonary trunk without kinking or tension. The excluded portion of the pulmonary trunk is opened and an end-to-side anastomosis performed between it and the LPA (see Fig. 51-17, *B*), refashioning the LPA end obliquely to increase the diameter of the anastomosis. The posterior layer of the anastomosis is performed from within the vessels, using continuous 6-0 or 7-0 polypropylene suture

and the anterior layer from outside. Clamps are then removed. Heparin is not reversed.

The pericardium is left open and the chest closed, leaving one intercostal tube for drainage.

#### Tracheal Resection and Relocation of Left Pulmonary Artery

When there is a localized area of tracheal stenosis, the trachea is minimally mobilized, and the tip of the endotracheal tube is ascertained to lie proximal to the proposed resection. A median sternotomy is performed and CPB established in the manner just described. The anomalous LPA is completely freed from surrounding structures and the stenotic area of

trachea excised (Fig. 51-18, *A*). The LPA is brought through the tracheal gap and positioned anterior to the trachea. The patient's neck is flexed if necessary, and an end-to-end tracheal anastomosis is performed (Fig. 51-18, *B* and *C*) using continuous 5-0 or 6-0 polydioxanone suture. CPB is discontinued after the patient has been rewarmed, and the remainder of the operation is completed in the usual manner (see "Completing Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2). Before muscle relaxants are discontinued in the intensive care unit, the patient is fitted with a back brace to prevent cervical extension.

Left pulmonary artery

If tracheal disease is of considerable length and associated with complete tracheal rings, local excision may not be corrective. These longer segments of tracheal stenosis are treated by tracheoplasty.B4 Using CPB, either a slide tracheoplastyG4,K5,T2 or a long tracheoplasty with pericardium is performed. For pericardial reconstruction, a vertical anterior incision is made in the trachea through the complete rings under bronchoscopic guidance. A pericardial patch is inserted with polydioxanone suture to widen the trachea. The patch appears to be adequate for enlarging the trachea but does not provide support to it and may collapse during inspiration, partially obstructing the trachea and resulting in noisy respiration for months to a year.B4 Options that do provide support are a tracheal insert fashioned from costal cartilageH3 or a prosthesis constructed from prosthetic mesh hardened with cyanoacrylate to which the pericardium is attached with biological glue.

The LPA is transected at its origin, repositioned, and anastomosed to the side of the distal pulmonary trunk to complete the operation.

When major associated cardiac anomalies are present, they can be repaired along with LPA reimplantation on CPB. Tracheal reconstruction, if needed, can be deferred for 2 to 4 days and performed as a separate procedure.

Because of the unavoidable mediastinal contamination from an open trachea, Konstantinov and colleagues recommend placing a pericardial flap between the great vessels and anterior tracheal suture lines.K5

## SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Care is as described in Section I. Special attention is required for tracheal care and secretion management if the trachea has been reconstructed.

## RESULTS

## Survival

Percent survival is not meaningful when derived from the small number of patients known to have been treated surgically. In the series reported by Backer and colleagues, there were no hospital deaths among 12 patients (0%; CL 0%-15%), but two (17%) patients died during the first postoperative year.B2

Mode of death is usually respiratory and related to tracheal abnormalities.S1 When these abnormalities are not present, prognosis is excellent.B2,D3,G1

#### Left Pulmonary Artery Patency

In many groups of patients operated on in an earlier era, usually through a left thoracotomy, the LPA anastomosis frequently was not patent late postoperatively.C1,P7,S1 With currently used methods, the anastomosis usually remains patent.B2,D3,L2

#### Freedom from Postoperative Respiratory Obstruction

When respiratory obstruction is due only to *compression* of the trachea by an anomalous LPA, relief is virtually always complete after simple reimplantation of the artery. Relief of symptoms has been obtained in a few such patients in whom only the ligamentum arteriosum or a patent ductus arteriosus has been divided.M10,P3,P4 When *tracheal stenosis* is a component of respiratory obstruction, tracheal resection and relocation of the LPA aided by CPB has provided complete relief of symptoms.J2 When there is *diffuse anatomic tracheal stenosis associated with complete cartilaginous rings*, relief of respiratory obstruction has been variable, but results after pericardial patch tracheoplasty can be good.B2

## INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

When anomalous LPA is present and there are symptoms and radiologic signs of important respiratory obstruction, operation is indicated. When respiratory symptoms are due to tracheal compression without fixed stenosis and without complete tracheal rings, either relocation and reimplantation of the LPA (preferably with CPB) or relocation after tracheal transection and reanastomosis is indicated. When a localized tracheal stenosis is present, resection of the stenosis, relocation of the LPA, and end-to-end anastomosis of the trachea are indicated.

When there is severe diffuse tracheal stenosis with complete cartilaginous rings, the surgical problem is more difficult. Correction of the left pulmonary arterial problem and simultaneous tracheoplasty of some type are indicated, but the outcome has been unpredictable.
