# DEFINITION

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic myocardial disorder characterized by left and/or right ventricular hypertrophy that is usually, but not always, asymmetric and is associated with microscopic evidence of myocardial fiber disarray and fibrosis.B10,W6,W7 Degree of hypertrophy at any given site can vary substantially and influences clinical manifestations of the disease.

*Ventricular septal hypertrophy* is the most common type of asymmetric hypertrophy, with midventricular, apical, and other types occurring much less frequently.W6 Forms interfering with left ventricular (LV) emptying, termed *hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy* (HOCM) or (obsolete) *idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis* (IHSS), are of surgical importance and are characterized by a variable dynamic obstruction that is usually subaortic and is associated with abnormal *systolic anterior motion* (SAM) of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. The more commonly occurring nonobstructive forms are not amenable to surgical treatment except for cardiac transplantation (see Chapter 21). Prevalence of HCM in the general population is about 1 in 500 (0.2%).M11

#### HISTORICAL NOTE

Pathologic findings compatible with HOCM were described by two 19th-century French pathologists, Hallopeau and Liouiville,H1,L5 and an early 20th-century German pathologist, Schmincke.S7 In 1952, Davies described a family from Cardiff, Wales, with five of nine siblings affected and three dying suddenly who probably had this disease. Although these reports and the surgical report of Brock in 1957 described diffuse muscular subaortic stenosis,B14 the disease was first accurately categorized by Teare, a London pathologist, in 1958.T4 Teare described both disproportionate thickening of the ventricular septum compared with the free wall and presence of myocardial fiber disarray in young people who died suddenly. These pathologic findings were rapidly confirmed,B3,M46 and clinical features were further elucidated by Braunwald and colleaguesB9,B10,B11 and others.G4,M36,V1,W4 To distinguish it from other cardiomyopathies, Goodwin and colleagues named it *hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy*, G4 whereas Braunwald and colleagues called it *idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis* B11 and Wigle and colleagues, *muscular subaortic stenosis*. W4

At that time, LV outflow tract obstruction was thought to be distinctive for the disease. That the anterior mitral leaflet contributed to the obstruction was first documented in 1964 by Fix and colleagues,F7 and SAM of the mitral valve was subsequently demonstrated angiographically.A2,D6 By the mid-1960s, HCM was a well-defined clinical entity,B10 with the realization that some patients had a form of the disease characterized by no or minimal obstruction.B8,M7 Particular attention was paid to this group of patients by Goodwin and Oakley,G6 who emphasized the importance of reduced LV compliance as the major determinant of cardiac dysfunction ("inflow" or diastolic obstruction) rather than outflow obstruction. Knowledge that nonobstructive HCM was much more common awaited introduction of echocardiography, which detected *asymmetric septal hypertrophy* (ASH),A1,H3 one of the hallmarks of the disease, as well as the presence or absence of SAM.P2,S11 During the early 1970s, ASH and SAM were thought to be specific for HCM,H3 but this is now known to be incorrect. Echocardiography not only established that HCM is relatively common, but also that it is usually genetically transmitted rather than sporadic.C3

Surgical awareness of the obstructive form of the disease began with Brock's reports in 1957 and 1959.B13,B14 However, in his patients and in the first patient operated on at Mayo Clinic in February 1958,K4 nothing was done surgically, because the nature of the disease was not understood. Credit for the first *myotomy,* consisting of a simple incision of the prominent anterior muscular ridge in the septum, probably belongs to Cleland.G4 Myotomy was used by a number of other surgeons about this same time.M47,M49,W4

At Mayo Clinic, a left ventriculotomy was performed to allow adequate excision *(myectomy)* of muscle under direct vision.K4 Over the next few years the surgical approach to *septal myectomy* was modified in several ways. Dobell and Scott used a left atrial approach, exposing the hypertrophied septum by dividing the anterior mitral leaflet across its center,D7 whereas Lillehei and Levy used a similar approach but detached the base of the anterior mitral leaflet near the anulus.L4 Swan used a corkscrew to excise septal muscle from a limited LV approach.S31 Julian and colleagues used a "fish mouth" LV incision that detached the lower part of the free wall from the septum and gave excellent exposure of the subaortic septal bulge, which was then excised.J2 Cooley and colleagues developed an approach through the right ventricle used first by Harken, in which septal muscle was shaved off the right ventricular side, judging septal thickness by means of a finger inserted into the LV through the aortic valve.C4,H2 None of these techniques is currently in use.

Simple myotomy using an aortic approach was used for a time by the Toronto group.B4 Later, they modified the procedure to include excision of muscle (myectomy) as advocated by Morrow.M45 Other procedures have also been used, including mitral valve replacement by Cooley and colleagues,C7 use of an LV-aortic valved conduit to bypass the obstruction,C11,D5 and a modified Konno procedure preserving the aortic valve (see "Modified Konno Operation" under Technique of Operation in Section II of Chapter 47).

# MORPHOGENESIS AND MORPHOLOGY

# Morphogenesis

HCM is caused by a missense mutation in one of at least 11 genes that encode the proteins of the cardiac sarcomere.R5 These include mutations in the β-myosin heavy-chain gene (chromosome 14q11-q12), in cardiac troponin-T (chromosome 1), and in α-tropomyosin (chromosome 15q2).B10,R5,W6,W7 It is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait,C3,G7,R5 although nonfamilial cases probably occur as well.

#### Morphology

Muscular hypertrophy present in HCM involves the interventricular septum and LV, and is variable in its location and severity.

#### *Ventricular Septum*

In classic HOCM, hypertrophy is maximal in the cephalad portion of the ventricular septum (Fig. 19-1). Point of maximal thickening lies just apical (caudad) to the free edge of the anterior mitral leaflet in its open position. This muscular prominence (mound) tapers off gradually toward the LV-aortic junction and toward the apex. At the point opposite the free edge of the anterior mitral leaflet, LV endocardium is often thickened by a localized plaque of fibrous tissue that lies at right angles to the long axis of the outflow tract. Because it is present in both nonobstructive and obstructive forms of HCM, this plaque is presumably related to contact between the anterior mitral leaflet and septal bulge in diastole rather than systole, with the leaflet snapping open rapidly at the onset of diastole (in part because of high left atrial pressure) and contacting the ventricular septal prominence.E2

Ventricular septal hypertrophy is not always maximal in its anterior basal parts. Occasionally, it may be maximal at a site below the anterior mitral leaflet adjacent to the papillary muscles, producing *midventricular hypertrophy* leading to *obstruction,*F3 to which the papillary muscles and free-wall hypertrophy contribute (Fig. 19-2). There is no SAM or mitral regurgitation. Apical LV aneurysm in the presence of normal coronary arteries occasionally occurs with midventricular hypertrophy.M23,W7 Hypertrophy may be confined to the posterior or apical septum.S14 Localized apical hypertrophy is apparently most common among the Japanese.Y1 Occasionally the entire septum may be of uniform thickness.M13,S13

#### *Dynamic Morphology of Septum and Mitral Valve*

When septal hypertrophy is classic, obstruction is sited in the LV outflow tract between the hypertrophied ventricular septum and anterior mitral leaflet. In systole the posterior mitral leaflet closes against the body of the elongated anterior leaflet at about the junction of the middle and free-edge thirds (rather than near the free edge as in the normal heart).

**Figure 19-1** Ventricular septal hypertrophy in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Longitudinal section of heart from a 32-year-old woman who died suddenly while receiving propranolol therapy. Hemodynamic investigation had confirmed presence of subaortic obstruction and mitral regurgitation, partially resulting from an abnormal mitral valve (insertion of anomalous papillary muscle *[arrow]* onto the ventricular surface of the anterior mitral leaflet). Note asymmetric hypertrophy with grossly thickened ventricular septum and narrowed outflow tract between upper septum and anterior mitral leaflet, which is very thickened and fibrosed from repeated mitral leaflet–septal contact. There was microscopic evidence of extensive myocardial fiber disarray involving both septum and free wall of the left ventricle. (From Wigle and colleagues.W6)

The free-edge portion of the anterior mitral leaflet beyond the point of coaptation hinges (angulates) on the remainder of the leaflet in a cephalad direction toward the aortic anulus (Fig. 19-3). This brings the free edge of the anterior mitral leaflet in contact with the ventricular septum. This SAM of the anterior leaflet is a constant feature of classic HOCM; degree of movement correlates with severity of obstruction,H5 as does diameter of the LV outflow tract at this point.S23 Ventricular ejection is rapid and early, mostly within the first half of systole. SAM is temporally related to peak LV outflow gradient and to cessation of flow in the ascending aorta.B19

The mechanism of SAM is probably multifactorial. Most likely, SAM is secondary to forward (anterior) displacement of the elongated mitral valve relative to the septum during systole,S23 and to subsequent movement of the distal portion of the mitral valve apparatus. In association with marked septal hypertrophy opposite the mitral leaflet and rapid and early ventricular ejection, the Venturi effect of the highvelocity stream of blood carries the protruding edge of the anterior mitral leaflet toward the aortic anulus in early systole. As a secondary event, the higher pressure below the anterior leaflet then forces it further into the outflow tract.H5 SAM is absent in nonobstructive HCM and when the obstruction is at a lower level. SAM can occur in transposition of the great arteries with intact ventricular septum (see "Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction" under Morphology in Chapter 52) and rarely in other disease states.M8,M14 SAM may also appear after mitral valve repair.K13

# *Left Ventricular Free Wall*

In obstructive HCM with ASH, free-wall hypertrophy is more marked than in nonobstructive formsH6 and is fairly uniform, particularly in the anterolateral and apical portions. There is, however, less thickening of the posterior free wall in almost all varieties of HCM.M1 Thus, the ratio between the thick upper anterior part of the ventricular septum and the thinner posterior wall beneath the posterior mitral leaflet (the portion through which the beam passes in M-mode

Cross-sectional slices of heart from a patient shown to have midventricular obstruction by hemodynamics, angiography, and echocardiography. Obstruction was at the level of the papillary muscles, where there was massive hypertrophy *(second slice from left)*. Slice at left is from base of the heart; two slices at right are from the apex. The apex was the site of extensive myocardial infarction and aneurysm formation that was evidenced by a dyskinetic apical chamber on angiography and by persistent ST-segment elevation in leads V4 to V6 on the electrocardiogram. Coronary arteries showed no important luminal narrowing. The patient died of intractable ventricular arrhythmias. (From Wigle and colleagues.W6)

(From Grigg and colleagues.G8)

echocardiographyT1) is 1.3 or more in almost all cases of HCM, with or without obstruction. ASH may be absent when septal hypertrophy is unusually located, and because it is occasionally present in diseases other than HCM, ASH is not pathognomonic of HCM.C5,M8,M13,M42 In fact, ASH has been demonstrated in numerous types of congenital heart disease, particularly in neonates and infantsL1,M5,M32,S20; in association with anomalies producing long-standing right ventricular hypertensionM8; in discrete subvalvar and valvar aortic stenosis; and even in normal hearts.L1 When present in early life in association with congenital heart disease, ASH tends to lessen or disappear with somatic growth.L1 ASH and SAM have been described in infants of diabetic mothers; this transient nonfamilial condition is not true HCM.G10

Unusual combinations and sites of septal and free-wall thickening in HCM result in a variable pattern of hypertrophy and obstruction. There can be midcavity obstruction,F3,W5 but more often in this variety, obstruction is absent and hypertrophy is symmetricS13 rather than asymmetric or involves a portion of septum or free wall in the sinus portion of the ventricle rather than in the outflow region.M12,M13,S13 Rarely, the posterobasal free wall may show localized hypertrophy, whereas the ventricular septum is of normal thickness.M21 Extreme hypertrophy of the apical portion of the septum and free wall can result in obliteration of the apical portion of the LV cavity in the absence of either SAM or ASH.K2,S14,Y1

#### *Left Ventricular Cavity*

In association with unusual shape of the ventricular septum, the LV cavity is small, even when heart failure occurs in later stages of HOCM, and has an S or sigmoid shape in systole when viewed in its longitudinal axis (Fig. 19-4). A sigmoid

shape is characteristic of patients younger than age 40 and is rare in patients older than 65.L3 When ventricular hypertrophy is located in the midportion of the ventricle, a dumbbellshaped cavity resultsF3; when it is confined to the apex, there may be complete obliteration of the lower half of the cavity and a spade-shaped basal portion.S14,Y1 LV apical aneurysms are present in approximately 2% of patients with HCM and occur over a wide age range.M23

Rarely the LV may become dilated in the late stages of HOCM. This dilatation may result from transmural myocardial infarction (MI)W1 or severe progression of the disease process, with or without heart failure.G3 Prognosis of patients with progressive LV wall thinning is poor, and concomitant cardiac failure is usually refractory to treatment.S24 Most patients show an "hourglass" contour of the cardiac border, with midventricular hypertrophy and intracavitary gradients.

# *Histopathology of Left Ventricle*

Microscopic findings in the hypertrophied ventricular septum are distinctive.H8 Increased wall thickness is mainly caused by increased fibrous tissue, particularly in the ventricular septum but also in the free wall.U1 Increase in muscle cell diameter and number of cell layers also contributes, with cell diameters being largest in layers closest to the cavity, perhaps because this is the site of greatest wall stress.U1

In addition, numerous foci of disarrayed muscle cells are interspersed between areas of hypertrophied but normally arranged (parallel) cells.F5,T4 In areas of disarray, muscle cells are wider and shorter than those present in hypertrophied muscle in other diseases, with increased cellular branching, extensive side-to-side intercellular junctions, widened Z bands, and formation of new sarcomeres. There are also abnormalities in orientation of myofibrils.F5 In obstructive forms of HCM, muscle cell disarray is confined to the ventricular septum, whereas in nonobstructive forms it may also occur in the LV free wall.M10,W8

Using a quantitative histologic method to determine extent of myocardial fiber disarray, Maron and Roberts found that the average degree of cell disarray in the ventricular septum of patients with HCM was 30%, compared with 1.5% in hearts with congenital or acquired cardiac disease or in normal hearts, and that when more than 5% of the relevant areas of the tissue section were involved, cell disarray was both highly sensitive (90%) and specific (93%) for HCM.M19 By contrast, Bulkley and colleagues concluded that myocardial fiber disarray found in HCM was qualitatively and quantitatively similar in the LV of hearts with aortic atresia and a patent mitral valve and in the right ventricle of hearts with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum.B20 Thus, it is unlikely that cell disarray is a morphologic manifestation of a genetically transmitted myocardial defect in HCMH4,M10; rather, it is likely the result of uncoordinated muscular contraction occurring in these conditions.B20,H9

Histologic ventricular abnormalities in HCM lead to more forceful LV contraction and rapid early ventricular emptying. In addition, reduced distensibility (compliance) and impaired relaxation result in a prolonged early filling phase and a decrease in rate and volume of the rapid phase of LV filling. Consequently, there is a compensatory increase in the contribution of atrial systole to overall LV filling.S1,S30,W7

## *Left Atrium*

The left atrium is often dilated and thick walled as a result of decreased compliance of the LV and presence of mitral regurgitation.

#### *Mitral Valve*

In obstructive forms of HCM, the mitral valve is positioned closer to the ventricular septum than in the normal heart.M15 Mitral valve leaflets are disproportionately elongated and thickened, particularly the leading edge of the anterior leaflet.C10,K1 This is presumably the result of SAM. The mitral anulus forcefully constricts during systole, and this pursestring action gathers the mitral leaflets into folds.C10

A further consequence of SAM is production of *mitral regurgitation* in mid- or late systole as the anterior leaflet moves forwardG8,S12 (see Fig. 19-3). Studies by Bonow and by Wigle and colleagues indicate a direct relation between magnitude of the pressure gradient and degree of mitral regurgitation.B5,W3,W7 It is likely that severity of mitral regurgitation, magnitude of the pressure gradient, and degree of prolongation of LV ejection time are determined by time of onset and duration of mitral leaflet–septal contact.W7

Mitral regurgitation occurs independently of SAM in about 20% of patients with HOCM.W3,W7 It can result from mitral valve prolapse, chordal rupture, anomalous attachment of a papillary muscle to the anterior leaflet, extensive anterior leaflet fibrosis resulting from repeated mitral leaflet–septal contact, congenital abnormalities, rheumatic disease, or mitral anular calcification.W3,W7 Presence of mitral regurgitation likely contributes to the exercise intolerance often present in patients with HOCM.B5 Mitral anular calcification is frequently present in older patients with HOCM.K12,T2

#### *Right Ventricle*

The right ventricular chamber is distorted by the hypertrophied ventricular septum, which projects into the right ventricular outflow tract. This hypertrophy may cause an important pressure gradient in the right ventricular outflow tract and, in long-standing cases, hypertrophy of the free wall. Right ventricular hypertrophy may also occur secondary to pulmonary hypertension from long-standing left-sided heart failure and elevated left atrial pressure. Unverferth and colleagues demonstrated an important increase in amount of fibrous tissue in the right ventricular free wall in HCM, as well as an increase in myocyte cell diameter in the subendocardial layer.U1

#### *Coronary Arteries*

In HCM, coronary arteries are larger in diameter than normal. Important coronary arteriosclerosis is present in about 5% of patients.G9,M20 Spray and colleagues and Maron and colleagues noted wall thickening and luminal narrowing of the intramural coronary arterial branches, located primarily in the ventricular septum and also occasionally in the left and right ventricular free wall in about half of patients with HCM.M22,S26 These abnormalities are not unique to HCM but are much less common in other forms of hypertrophy.M22 Muscular bridging of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) during part of its course is more common in HCM than in normal hearts. The LAD may become totally occluded during systole at these sitesK5 or may have an irregular sawtooth appearance.B17 Septal perforating arteries may be obliterated or severely narrowed during systole. Hemodynamic effect of these changes is not known, although Maron and colleagues and Waller and colleagues have reported that transmural myocardial infarction occurs in HCM in the absence of arteriosclerotic coronary artery disease.M9,W1 Using thallium perfusion imaging and computed tomography, O'Gara and colleagues demonstrated that myocardial ischemia can occur in HCM both at rest and after exercise.O1 This could be caused by systolic arterial compression or spasm, narrowing of intramural branches, inadequate capillary density, or reduction in diastolic coronary flow from impaired ventricular relaxation.

### *Associated Lesions*

There is a specific association between HCM and diffuse lentiginosis.S19 No evidence indicates that the latter is inherited.S28 Association with essential hypertension noted in Brock's original report is probably coincidental, although Wei and colleagues suggest that a "hypertrophic cardiomyopathy" with features indistinguishable from some forms of HCM can occur in a number of other disease states including severe long-standing hypertension and severe aortic valvar stenosis.B14,W2 Similarly, there may be a coincidental association of HCM with other congenital or acquired cardiac diseases such as atrial septal defect and rheumatic heart disease. With HOCM, functional impairment of von Willebrand factor (a plasma glycoprotein required for normal hemostasis) is frequent and is closely and independently related to the magnitude of outflow obstruction.L2 A resting peak gradient of 15 mmHg is sufficient to impair function of this glycoprotein and may result in abnormal spontaneous bleeding.

# CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

HOCM symptoms and signs are usually such that diagnosis can be made with confidence on clinical grounds. Subaortic or midventricular obstruction may be latent (provocable), labile, or persistent (obstruction at rest).W1,W6 In contrast, in nonobstructive HCM there may be no symptoms or signs, particularly in mild forms. In the text that follows, only obstructive HCM (HOCM) is discussed.

# Symptoms

Symptoms associated with HOCM can occur at any age from infancy to beyond 70 years. They include angina, effort dyspnea, syncope, and dizziness on exertion, singly or in combination. However, these symptoms may not be related directly to the magnitude of LV outflow gradient. Rather, they are caused by a complex interaction of diastolic dysfunction, arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and outflow gradient.M3

Palpitation may occur, usually from atrial fibrillation, which may initially be paroxysmal but is permanent in about 10% of patients in the later stages of the disease. Onset of atrial fibrillation is usually heralded by a sudden increase in dyspnea and sometimes by heart failure and hypotension because of the rapid rate and loss of the atrial component of ventricular filling.G2 Almost half of patients presenting with atrial fibrillation have a history of systemic embolism. Arrhythmia may also be caused by ventricular premature beats or bouts of ventricular tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia, and can result in sudden death.M34,S4

Later stages of HOCM are associated with severe and progressive heart failure with paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, and pulmonary edema. Rarely, ascites and peripheral edema develop in association with tricuspid regurgitation.

#### Signs

The three cardinal signs of HOCM are (1) late-onset systolic ejection murmur between the left sternal edge and apex, (2) bifid arterial pulse, and (3) palpable left atrial contraction.G5

The physical signs in typical cases of HOCM differ in important respects from other forms of aortic outflow obstruction. The pulse is jerky (bifid) with a rapid upstroke, in contrast to the anacrotic pulse of valvar aortic stenosis. An abnormal jugular *a* wave is frequently present, and occasionally, a short, low-pitched diastolic flow murmur that is enhanced by inspiration; both are the result of vigorous atrial contraction.B12 The thrusting, overactive LV impulse is frequently double because of transmission of the forceful atrial contraction, which may also be audible as a fourth heart sound. Frequently, there is a third sound at the apex. Splitting of the second heart sound may be paradoxical, but this feature, as well as a gallop rhythm, is characteristically variable because of dynamic and variable obstruction. A midsystolic murmur that is roughly proportional in intensity to the degree of obstruction is maximal between the left sternal edge and apex of the heart rather than in the aortic area, although it radiates to the base; a thrill may be present. The murmur increases in intensity after a Valsalva maneuver (or inhalation of amyl nitrite), because both increase the degree of obstruction. When important mitral regurgitation is present, the murmur is maximal at the apex and pansystolic. There is no aortic ejection click. Valvar calcification and an aortic diastolic murmur are also absent (except in occasional cases in which the valve is abnormal). Infants and young children presenting with severe HOCM may be cyanotic from reversal of shunt flow at the atrial level.D1

#### Ventricular Function

Although in early stages of HCM, LV systolic function is usually normal or occasionally supranormal, with high ejection fraction in both the obstructive and nonobstructive forms of the disease,W6 in HOCM (i.e., in later stages), impaired systolic function of both left and right ventricles occurs, primarily as a result of myocardial fibrosis.F2,T3,W6 Fibrosis can result from fibrous transformation of loose intracellular connective tissue located between the myocardial fibers,T3,W7 or from myocardial ischemia and infarction caused by small-vessel or arteriosclerotic coronary artery disease.M9,W1 Myocardial fibrosis may result in thinning of the wall, reduction or loss of outflow obstruction, reduced ejection fraction, and increased end-systolic volume.W6

Diastolic dysfunction was initially attributed to decreased ventricular compliance.B11,W6 However, it now appears that impaired relaxation is the more important cause.W6,W7 Increased chamber stiffness increases diastolic pressure with respect to volume *(dP/dV),* and the diastolic pressure-volume curve is shifted upward and to the left.W6

# Electrocardiography

The electrocardiogram (ECG) in HOCM characteristically shows an LV strain pattern, although Q waves may be present, and rarely, minimal changes indicative of LV hypertrophy despite an important gradient.M33,M34,W7 Occasionally the ECG shows complete right or left bundle branch block and more often left anterior hemiblock.S3 Giant negative T waves in V4-V6 are typical of isolated apical hypertrophy.Y1 ECG features of left atrial enlargement are often noted, but those of right atrial enlargement less often.

# Chest Radiography

Chest radiography shows mild to moderate cardiomegaly more often in HOCM than in other forms of aortic outflow obstruction. The aorta is typically small. The raised left atrial pressure may be reflected in the lung fields by evidence of pulmonary venous hypertension or frank interstitial edema.

# Echocardiography

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the most important diagnostic study. Diagnosis can usually be established by M-mode echocardiography because, with rare exceptions, patients with familial HOCM have ASH, and all those with obstruction should demonstrate SAM, although this may appear only on provocation (e.g., after Valsalva maneuver). Standard echocardiography combined with Doppler color flow interrogation can be used to identify systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction, degree and direction of mitral regurgitation, presence of additional mitral valve abnormalities, and size of the left atrium.C2,P1,R1,W1,W6,Y2 Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) with Doppler color flow interrogation is invaluable for defining extent and level of outflow obstruction and abnormalities of the mitral valve (Fig. 19-5). It should be used preoperatively for planning the operative procedure and intraoperatively to assess its effectiveness (Fig. 19-6).G8,M26

# Exercise Echocardiography

Exercise echocardiography may identify LV outflow obstruction in symptomatic patients who would not otherwise be regarded as candidates for interventional treatment. Maron and colleaguesM25 reported on 320 patients with HCM judged to be eligible for exercise testing, of whom 201 underwent standard exercise testing with echocardiography; 119 had LV outflow tract gradients at rest of 50 mmHg or more and were not tested. In the 201 patients, LV outflow tract gradient increased from 4 ± 9 (median ≈ 0) mmHg at rest to 45 ± 49 (median ≈ 30) mmHg after exercise. In 106 patients (52%), gradients of 30 mmHg or more developed, including 76 (38%) that were 50 mmHg or more. Only a minority of

(From Grigg and colleagues.G8)

the exercised patients with gradients developed severe mitral regurgitation, suggesting that the long-term consequences of obstruction are likely caused by the subaortic gradient and elevated LV pressure rather than by mitral regurgitation.

#### Cardiac Catheterization and Cineangiography

The diagnostic accuracy of echocardiography has substantially reduced the need for invasive studies in patients with HOCM.W6 Cardiac catheterization and cineangiography are generally reserved for patients in whom echocardiographic studies are inconclusive, those in whom arteriosclerotic coronary artery disease is likely to be present, and those for whom surgical treatment (septal myectomy, dual-chamber pacemaker insertion, or cardiac transplantation) is being considered.

Right-sided heart catheterization will show any infundibular stenosis (occasionally severe) and elevation of pulmonary artery pressure, which may also be substantial because of high left atrial pressure.F8 Retrograde left-sided heart catheterization will quantify and localize the obstruction. The catheter tip should be positioned near the base of the LV close to the mitral valve to avoid apical entrapment, which can produce a falsely high LV pressure.C12 LV end-diastolic pressure is usually increased, often greatly, because of transmission of a large left atrial *a* wave (Fig. 19-7). Central and peripheral arterial pulse contours show a rapidly ascending limb with a short upstroke (0.06 to 0.085) but a total ejection time greater than 0.335. A secondary systolic atrial wave results in the characteristic "spike and dome" (bifid) pulse contour initially described by Benchimol and colleagues.B2 The beat following a ventricular ectopic beat shows an abnormal response—a reduced arterial pulse pressure (and an exaggerated spike-and-dome contour) secondary to increased obstruction generated by the ectopic beat.B15 Obstruction is increased by any maneuver that increases LV contractility or decreases LV preload or afterload. Whenever the obstruction increases, pulse pressure decreases and total LV ejection time increases.

This dynamic characteristic of the obstruction can be confirmed by various provocative maneuversB9 such as isoproterenol administration, exercise, and Valsalva maneuver, which

Aortic pressure pulse shows typical double contour ("spike and dome"). LV end-diastolic pressure is elevated in association with transmission of an *a* wave from the left atrium *(arrow)*. The beat after an ectopic beat demonstrates reduced aortic pulse pressure characteristic of HOCM *(center of tracing)*.

increase the gradient, and by methoxamine administration, which decreases it.

Systolic LV outflow gradient often is not increased *during* exercise but becomes dramatically increased almost immediately *after* exercise.K6 The increase usually becomes maximal 3 to 5 minutes into the recovery period. Presumably, increased systemic venous return prevents substantial reduction of LV volume (and increase in the gradient) during exercise despite increased myocardial contractility, heart rate, and cardiac output and a reduced systemic vascular resistance. After exercise, decreased venous return allows a reduction in LV volume and an increase in systolic gradient.M3

LV cineangiography is best performed in the left lateral view because in this position the cardiac apex moves caudally and does not overshadow the mitral area.

The prominent characteristic septal bulge can be seen to form the anterior boundary of the outflow tract and the anterior mitral leaflet to form its posterior boundary. SAM can usually be demonstrated when obstruction is present (Fig. 19-8).

Degree of mitral regurgitation can be assessed from the LV cineangiogram. However, multiple ectopic beats can make quantitation difficult. Coronary angiography should be added to the procedure in patients older than age 30 years in whom coronary artery occlusive disease is suspected or known to be present.

### NATURAL HISTORY

In familial HCM, isolated ASH, identified by M-mode echocardiography, is an important part of the clinical spectrum and has the same genetic implications as HOCM. It is uncertain whether isolated ASH, an asymptomatic disease, develops into clinical obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM); if so, this sequence is uncommon after age 20 years.E1

HCM can present at any age from early infancyM6 to the sixth or seventh decade. Echocardiographic studies of patients with HCM, including those with isolated ASH, suggest that obstruction is present in only about 20%. Infants and young

**Figure 19-8** Left ventricular cineangiogram in left lateral position showing systolic anterior motion of anterior mitral leaflet. **A,** Isovolumetric contraction. Anterior *(a)* and posterior *(p)* mitral leaflets are apposed in relatively normal systolic position, causing only slight narrowing low in left ventricular outflow tract despite prominent septal muscle *(s)* anteriorly. Aortic valve is still closed. **B,** Systolic ejection phase. Apposed free edges of mitral leaflets have risen to maximal level of obstruction, with anterior leaflet almost meeting the septal muscle. Despite severe obstruction (systolic gradient of 100 mmHg), there is no detectable mitral regurgitation.

children presenting with symptomatic HOCM represent the more severe end of the spectrum, with gross LV hypertrophy, frequent episodes of heart failure, and a high prevalence of sudden death.D1 Progression of disease may be more rapid in children and young adults.W6

The natural history of HCM is typically variable. Although the clinical course is often stable over long periods, adverse events such heart failure, syncope, sudden cardiac death, and peripheral embolization can occur.M24 Sudden onset of heart failure is frequently precipitated by atrial fibrillation, which

**Figure 19-9** Freedom from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)-related death among 273 patients with a left ventricular outflow gradient of at least 30 mmHg under basal conditions and 828 patients without obstruction at entry. (From Maron and colleagues.M24)

![](_page_9_Figure_3.jpeg)

may be associated with subsequent embolism. In patients with HOCM, correlation between symptomatic class and degree of obstruction has generally not been close, although in the multicenter trial reported by Shah and colleagues, there were no asymptomatic patients once the gradient exceeded 100 mmHg.S10 Frank and Braunwald documented a substantially higher gradient in patients in New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes III and IV compared with those without symptoms.F8 In the experience of Wigle and colleagues, presyncope and syncope on exertion are encountered most frequently in patients with HOCM.W6

Annual HCM-related mortality reported from referral centers has ranged from 4% to 6% in children and 2% to 4% in adultsM24,M32,M33,W6 (Figure 19-9). In contrast, studies involving largely unselected patients with HCM report annual mortality of 0.5% to 1.5%, similar to that for the adult general population.K9,M2,S22,W6

Sudden cardiac death is common in patients with HCM.M32 Risk factors for sudden death include a basal (resting) peak instantaneous gradient of at least 30 mmHg,M24 young age, syncope, family history of malignancy, myocardial ischemia (particularly in the young), sustained ventricular tachycardia on electrophysiologic testing, and ventricular tachycardia on ambulatory monitoring.W6 HCM is the most common association with unexplained sudden death in otherwise apparently healthy competitive athletes.M2 Midventricular obstruction is an independent predictor of adverse outcomes especially for the combined endpoint of sudden death and potentially lethal arrhythmic events.M50

Neurologic death from cerebral embolism occurs in patients with permanent or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or, infrequently, as a result of infective endocarditis on aortic and mitral valves.H9 In the multicenter study by Shah and colleagues in patients with obstruction, but not operated on and followed for an average of 5.2 years, only one died from heart failure and two from infective endocarditis, but 23 from sudden cardiac death.S10

# TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

# Myectomy by Aortic Approach

A full or partial upper median sternotomy is used, and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is established in standard fashion (see "Preparation for Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2). During cooling, a left atrial drainage catheter is inserted through a purse-string suture in the right superior pulmonary vein near its junction with the left atrium. A catheter can also be placed into the coronary sinus through a purse-string suture in the wall of the right atrium for retrograde delivery of cardioplegic solution (see "Technique of Retrograde Infusion" in Chapter 3). The distal ascending aorta is clamped, and cardioplegic solution is infused through a needle in the ascending aorta (see "Cold Cardioplegia, Controlled Aortic Root Reperfusion, and [When Needed] Warm Cardioplegic Induction" in Chapter 3). The aorta is then opened through a transverse aortotomy or through an oblique incision that extends into the non-coronary sinus of Valsalva (Fig. 19-10, *A*). Stay sutures are applied to the edges of the aortotomy or to the aortic valve commissures to improve exposure. If additional myocardial protection is necessary, the coronary ostia can be cannulated and directly perfused with cardioplegic solution (see "Perfusion of Individual Coronary Arteries" in Chapter 3).

The right aortic cusp is retracted anteriorly against the sinus wall. Hypertrophied septum can be seen bulging down into the anterior aspect of the LV outflow tract (Fig. 19-10, *B*). A narrow ribbon retractor can be placed into the LV outflow tract and depressed posteriorly to avoid injury to the chordae tendineae and anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Using a No. 15 (small rounded) scalpel blade, an incision is made deep into the septum, exactly beneath the nadir of the right coronary cusp and parallel to the long axis of the LV outflow tract. A second parallel incision in the septum is made as far leftward as possible without damaging the mitral valve (Fig. 19-10, *C*). As suggested by Morrow,M45 a sponge stick can be pressed against the right ventricular free wall to depress the ventricular septum and bring it into better view through the aortotomy. Both incisions are then deepened and carried toward the LV apex as far as possible—often beyond visibility, because no structures can be damaged in this area. The two vertical incisions are then connected by a transverse incision beginning several mm below the right coronary cusp. This may prevent prolapse of the right coronary cusp and development of aortic regurgitation. With continuing pressure on the sponge stick, this transverse incision is extended downward into the ventricle until a thick, rectangular piece of septum has been excised (Fig. 19-10, *D*). In patients with important

Dashed lines indicate initial incisions into the septum. **C,** Two parallel incisions are made in the septum: (1) beneath nadir of right coronary cusp and (2) as far leftward as possible. These incisions are joined by a transverse incision *(dashed line)*, which is made several millimeters below the edge of the right aortic cusp. **D,** Rectangular channel created by septal myectomy.

hypertrophy of the adjacent left anterolateral free wall, a third incision is made beginning below the commissure between left and right coronary cusps and is directed toward the base of the anterolateral papillary muscle. Septal tissue between this incision and the primary trough already created is excised to further increase the cross-sectional area of the LV outflow tract (Fig. 19-10, *E*).R3 Care is taken to remove any small pieces of muscle from the LV cavity; the left index finger is then passed through the valve into the cavity. If palpation of the septum confirms that the excision has traversed the entire length of the muscular obstruction (Fig. 19-10, *F*), operation is considered to be complete. The aortotomy is closed, and CPB is discontinued (see "Completing Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2).

In pediatric patients, HOCM has a more variable morphologic spectrum. The major site of obstruction may be subaortic, although it often occurs at the midventricular or apical level. Obstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract also occurs. Within the LV, hypertrophied muscle may extend onto the base of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve, and

![](_page_11_Picture_2.jpeg)

these fibromuscular attachments may contribute to SAM of the anterior leaflet. When present, they should be carefully incised at both margins of the base of the anterior leaflet during the transaortic myectomy to reduce or eliminate abnormal SAM of the anterior leaflet.

### Adjuncts to Conventional Myectomy

*Intraoperative TEE* facilitates performing septal myectomy by determining accurately the location and thickness of hypertrophied septum, detecting other lesions, assisting assessment of adequacy of the myectomy and correction of mitral regurgitation, and identifying complications such as ventricular septal perforation.G8,M26 Among 50 patients who underwent septal myectomy and in whom intraoperative echocardiography was used, 10 (20%; CL 14%-28%) required a second period of CPB for further resection of muscle because of persisting LV outflow tract gradients greater than 50 mmHg or for correcting more than moderate mitral regurgitation.M26

If adequate myectomy has been performed, there will be little or no residual gradient, SAM, or mitral regurgitation. *Direct measurements of LV and ascending aortic pressures* should be made after discontinuing CPB under stable hemodynamic conditions. If a residual gradient of more than 10 to 15 mmHg is present, CPB should be reestablished and additional muscle resected.

*Extended myectomy and reconstruction of the subvalvar mitral apparatus* have been proposed by Messmer.M38 The septal myectomy is deeply extended into the LV cavity, wider toward the apex than the base, thus providing access to the base of both papillary muscles. These are mobilized down to the apex, and all hypertrophied portions and muscular trabeculae are resected. In theory, mobilization of malpositioned papillary muscles from the adjacent myocardium permits the mitral valve leaflets to be deflected away from the LV outflow tract during systole.S8 A similar technique has been reported by Maron and colleaguesM17 and Minakata and colleaguesM39 for managing outflow obstruction in the midventricular region that results from muscular apposition created by anomalous chordae tendinae or anomalous insertion of a papillary muscle directly into the anterior mitral leaflet without interposition of chordae tendinae.K7 In the latter instance, the papillary muscle is incised and separated from the ventricular septum or free wall down to its base. If an accessory muscle is present in the LV outflow tract, it is excised by amputating it at its base and severing the fibrous attachments to the anterior mitral leaflet.D2

*Plication of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve with myectomy,* first proposed by McIntosh and colleagues,M30 has been performed in patients judged at operation to be at increased risk for a suboptimal hemodynamic result because of morphology of the mitral valve (increased mobility, size, or length of anterior leaflet with respect to LV outflow tract dimension) and potential for its anterior leaflet to protrude into the myectomy trough during systole. Plication can be performed through the aortic valve either in the horizontal direction or vertically (tip of leaflet to base) using several interrupted polypropylene sutures.B1,K1

*Anterior leaflet extension* by insertion of a pericardial patch into the body of the anterior leaflet has been employed by some groups.M40 This maneuver increases leaflet stiffness, causes lateral displacement of the secondary chordae tendinae, and functions hemodynamically as a spinnaker sail to eliminate SAM.V2 The effectiveness of leaflet plication and extension in reducing LV outflow tract obstruction and SAM has not been evaluated in large clinical trials.

*Apical myectomy* has been proposed for treatment of severely symptomatic patients with apical HCM and for patients with midventricular obstruction.S32,S33 Through an incision in the apex of the left ventricle lateral to the left anterior descending coronary artery, excision of ventricular muscle at the apex and midventricular levels is performed with the objective of increasing the LV end-diastolic volume and improving LV compliance. Postoperative hemodynamic studies in 14 of a series of 44 patients reported by Schaff and colleagues using this technique, showed a significant (P = .002 or less) decrease in LV end-diastolic pressure, increase in LV diastolic volume index, and increase in stroke volume.S32 Five-year survival was 81%.

#### Modified Konno Operation

When echocardiography or initial visual examination through the aortic valve shows that muscular obstruction is deeper (more toward the apex) in the LV outflow tract than usual, or when there is residual muscular obstruction inferiorly after creating a trough, a modified Konno operation can be performed (see "Modified Konno Operation" under Technique of Operation in Section II of Chapter 47). The modified Konno operation may occasionally be selected preoperatively as the preferred procedure because of severity and location of obstruction.

# Mitral Valve Replacement

The role of mitral valve replacement in managing patients with HOCM remains incompletely defined. Cooley and colleagues have shown that excising the anterior mitral leaflet relieves LV outflow tract obstruction in most patients.C7,F6,K11 McIntosh and colleagues showed that in comparing patients undergoing mitral valve replacement, septal myectomy, or septal myectomy combined with plication of the anterior mitral leaflet, the greatest reductions in resting and provocable outflow tract gradients and in LV end-diastolic pressure occurred in those who had mitral valve replacement.M29,M30 Mitral valve replacement may be necessary for patients who have intrinsic disease of the mitral valve that is not typically associated with HOCM. This includes patients with rheumatic or severe myxomatous or degenerative disease that is not amenable to repair.K1 A concomitant septal myectomy should be performed in most patients.

If mitral valve replacement is performed, all chordal attachments between papillary muscles and mitral valve leaflets must be severed (see Fig. 19-10, *F* and *G*). The entire anterior leaflet of the mitral valve must be excised. If hypertrophied and contributing to obstruction, the papillary muscles are excised. The small size and at times abnormal shape of the LV cavity require use of a low-profile prosthesis, most often a mechanical valve.

#### Mitral Valve Repair

Other structural abnormalities of the mitral valve besides those typically associated with HOCM exist in approximately 7% of patients undergoing surgical treatment of HOCM.K1 Mitral valve repair is feasible in 50% to 60% of these patients using conventional reparative techniques.K1 Anuloplasty rings should be avoided, however, to prevent SAM. If anuloplasty is necessary, flexible or rigid bands on the posterior leaflet are preferred.

# SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

The patient is cared for with the principles and protocols described in Chapter 5. Marked LV hypertrophy reduces ventricular compliance to such an extent that left atrial pressures of 16 to 18 mmHg may be required early postoperatively for adequate preload. Digitalis glycosides and the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol should be avoided because they increase myocardial contractility and may increase residual outflow tract gradient. Hypovolemia and nitroglycerin, which can reduce LV volume and exaggerate any residual gradient,M25 should also be avoided. Atrial fibrillation may be poorly tolerated, so measures should be taken to reduce its probability of occurrence and to treat it aggressively if it develops. This can be best accomplished by use of β-adrenergic receptor blocking agents (e.g., propranolol), calcium antagonists (e.g., verapamil, diltiazem), or amiodarone.

# RESULTS

#### Early (Hospital) Death

In the larger surgical series of patients treated in the 1980s and early 1990s, hospital mortality ranged from 0% to 6%.M4,M40,S18,W9,W10 Mortality has remained somewhat higher with concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting and valve

replacement.L2,M4 As emphasized by Maron and colleagues, it is appropriate to cite these low mortality statistics to current candidates for myectomy rather than to quote older, obsolete data.M4 Myocardial failure has been the principal mode of early death.B18,H7,M44,R3

#### Time-Related Survival

Using data from the largest surgical series, 5-year survival has ranged from 84% to 96% and 10-year survival from 71% to 88%.B18,M44,O2,R3,S6,S18,S29,W10 Schulte and colleagues reported 88% 10-year and 72% 20-year survival in a group of 364 patients (Fig. 19-11).S6 Woo and colleagues reported similar 10- and 20-year survival (83% and 68%, respectively) among 338 adult patients.W10 Survival is higher in patients undergoing isolated myectomy than in those undergoing combined procedures. Survival approaches that for the general U.S. population (Fig 19-12).

#### Modes of Death

Cardiac failure, sudden death, ventricular arrhythmias, and stroke are the most common cardiovascular modes of death after discharge from the hospital.B18,C2,H7,M44,O2,R3,S6,W10

# Incremental Risk Factors for Premature Death

Older age at operation is a risk factor for early and late death.H7,K8,M44,R3,W10 However, many elderly patients not only survive, but also exhibit marked hemodynamic and symptomatic improvement.C8 Addition of mitral valve replacement or repair to myotomy or myectomy is a risk factor for late death.H7 In separate series, female gender,W10 preoperative syncope,H7 increased NYHA functional class,B18,M44 documented coronary artery disease,R3 preoperative atrial fibrillation,W10 concomitant procedures,B18,H7 mitral valve replacement,H7 development of complete heart block,H7 and persisting outflow tract gradients greater than 15 mmHgM44 were incremental risk factors for late death.

# Myocardial Changes

The effect of surgical reduction of LV outflow tract obstruction on cardiac structure and function has been demonstrated. Deb and colleaguesD3 demonstrated a significant decrease in LV mass and mass index assessed by TTE in 60 patients following septal myectomy. This favorable remodeling occurred early after operation and persisted beyond 2 years. Among 150 patients followed for a median of 1.8 years and for up to 20 years after septal myectomy, substantial improvement in LV diastolic filling as determined by mitral inflow Doppler velocity signals was observed.M43 Menon and colleaguesM37 reported a significant (*P* < .0001) decrease in echocardiographically determined mean left atrial volume index among 32 young patients (mean age 12.5 years) after septal myectomy. This reduction correlated closely with decrease in severity of mitral regurgitation (*P* = .04) Cannon and colleaguesC1 noted a reduction in oxygen consumption and corresponding reduction in coronary blood flow, and a change from lactate production during pacing to lactate consumption, in the anterior portion of the LV and septum. The changes were more marked in patients with high coronary flow reserve before reoperation.

#### Conduction Disturbances

Complete heart block occurs in from 2.5% to 10% of patients.  $^{B18,C4,H7,M44,R3,S8,S18,S29,T6,W10}$ 

When complete right bundle branch block is present preoperatively, creating left bundle branch block (LBBB) at operation results in complete heart block. R3 Complete LBBB develops in approximately 50% of patients post-operatively. In a recently reported series of 323 patients undergoing isolated septal myectomy, pacemakers were required in 7 (3%) with normal preoperative conduction, in 15 (30%) with any preexisting conduction abnormality, and in 10 (77%) with right bundle branch block. In this series, new permanent pacemakers were implanted in 19 additional patients during follow-up, which averaged  $3.6 \pm 2.8$  years and extended to 8 years. Freedom from pacemaker insertion at 8 years was 79%.

## Perioperative Myocardial Infarction

Perioperative myocardial infarction occurs occasionally at sites remote from the myotomy and can occur without associated coronary arterial occlusive disease. M48 With current techniques for intraoperative myocardial preservation, occurrence of myocardial infarction is low.

# **latrogenic Defects**

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is created in up to 3% of patients treated by transaortic myotomy or myectomy. M16,M44,T5 In recently reported series from experienced centers, the frequency is less than 1%. S18,W10 McIntosh and colleagues believe that an iatrogenic VSD is more likely to occur when the septum is relatively thin (<18 mm). M31 VSD may not be detected until some weeks after operation and could then be the result of septal infarction rather than surgical perforation. S26 A VSD may contribute to hospital mortality and may be large enough to require subsequent repair. M16,R3

Aortic valve regurgitation can occur after operations for HOCM. It occurred postoperatively in 5% of 115 patients (CL 3.1%-8.3%) reported by Mohr and colleagues and in 4% of 525 patients (CL 3.1%-5.1%) operated on exclusively through the aortic root by Brown and colleagues. B16,M44 In the latter series, regurgitation developed within 6 months of operation in more than half the patients. Sasson and colleagues, using pulsed or color Doppler echocardiography to quantify severity of aortic regurgitation, found the prevalence of aortic regurgitation to be 54% in 52 patients who were studied a mean of 7.8 years postoperatively. S2 Clinically evident aortic regurgitation was present in only 12% of these patients. The authors noted that although initially trivial, regurgitation may progress over time, but it was well tolerated in all patients who were studied. In the experience of Brown and colleagues, a small aortic anulus (≤21 mm in diameter) and a low mitral-septal contact lesion increased the probability of postoperative regurgitation, probably in both cases the result of increased operative difficulty and increased retraction and possible injury of aortic valve cusps. B16 Loss of support of the right coronary cusp as a result of excising septal muscle beneath it may result in aortic regurgitation, M29 as may

altered velocity, direction, and dynamics of the turbulent jet of blood in the outflow tract. S2 These observations emphasize the importance of considering alternative approaches to the obstruction, or mitral valve replacement in patients in whom the aortic anulus is small or the area of obstruction is difficult to expose through the aortic root. Avoiding resection of the first few mm of ventricular muscle beneath the right coronary cusp may prevent subsequent cusp prolapse and aortic regurgitation.

# Postoperative Pressure Gradients

Adequate myectomy substantially reduces preoperative gradients, B18,M40,R3,S6,S8,S18,S29 although on provocation a mild gradient can be demonstrated in about 25% of patients. S6,S8,S29 In those in whom a gradient is present preoperatively only on provocation, these maneuvers do not produce a gradient postoperatively. In addition, operation almost always abolishes abnormal postectopic response and abnormal arterial pulse contour. In patients with several postoperative evaluations extending over many years, residual gradient either remains the same or diminishes (Fig. 19-13, A). M16,R3,S18

(From Smedira and colleagues.  $^{518}$ )

When gradients and symptoms persist after inadequate myectomy, reoperation is advised. The procedure can be a repeat myectomy through the aortic root, a modified Konno procedure preserving the aortic valve, or—particularly when the ventricular septum is less than 18 mm thick on echocardiographic assessment—mitral valve replacement.M31,M41

#### Systolic Anterior Motion of the Mitral Valve

Both echocardiography and cineangiography show reduction or abolition of SAM of the mitral valve in most patients, and this is generally sustained (see Figs. 19-6, 19-13, *B*).G8,S18,W6 In addition, grooves created by myectomy and reduced thickness of the myectomy site are demonstrable by these techniquesS5 and may result in enlargement of the LV outflow tract.F9,S25

# Mitral Regurgitation

Mitral regurgitation is usually abolished or substantially reduced after adequate myotomy or myectomy (see Fig. 19-6).C9,G8,W6 Persistent important mitral regurgitation usually suggests a coexisting mitral lesion such as mitral valve prolapse, spontaneous chordal rupture, or damage from infective endocarditis.W6

#### Symptomatic Status

Many reports indicate striking symptomatic improvement in patients who have undergone adequate myotomy or myectomy.B18,H7,M16,M29,M44,S9 Most patients promptly become completely asymptomatic or complain of mild effort dyspnea only, and syncope is usually abolished.M44 Approximately 80% to 90% of patients are in NYHA functional class I or II postoperatively.B18,H7,M44,S6,S8,S18 No strong evidence indicates that late recurrence of symptoms is related to recurrence of obstruction. Patients who die late from arrhythmia or cerebral embolization are usually asymptomatic before the event, and in those dying in heart failure, deterioration is frequently rapid. The longer the follow-up, the greater the number of patients dying in heart failure from progression of the disease process (impaired diastolic relaxation).

Atrial fibrillation adversely affects symptoms as well as long-term survival.W10 Surgical relief of obstruction in HOCM does not consistently abolish chronic atrial fibrillation or permit successful cardioversion. When this rhythm occurs as a new feature in later stages of the disease, there is further symptomatic deterioration and, if anticoagulants are not given, a high probability of thromboembolism. Although surgical and catheter-based ablation procedures for this atrial fibrillation have been performed,M27,O3 the combined Cleveland, Rio de Janeiro, Venice, and San Francisco experience suggests that atrial fibrillation recurrence after these procedures is frequent.K3

#### Left Ventricular Function and Structure

Preoperative resting ejection fraction, greatly increased in patients with HOCM (76% ± 9%), is reduced postoperatively (*P* < .001) to 67% ± 18%, a figure that lies well within the range of normal.B6 Preoperatively, during exercise, ejection fraction falls to within the normal range (71% ± 14%) and postoperatively falls slightly (66% ± 18%). These data do not suggest that important damage to the LV results from a transaortic myectomy. LV cavity size and wall thickness are decreased, as are left atrial pressure and volume.M43,N2,W6

# INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Septal myectomy should be considered for any patient who remains symptomatic (NYHA class III or IV) after appropriate medical therapy (β-adrenergic receptor blockade, calcium antagonists, disopyramide), septal ablation (see "Special Indications and Controversies"), or pacemaker therapy, and who has an important LV subaortic gradient (≥50 mmHg) at rest or after physiologically based provocation with exercise, caused by SAM with septal contact.M37 In the extensive experience of Wigle and colleagues, successful operation (total relief of obstruction at rest or on provocation) provides substantially more hemodynamic and symptomatic benefit than any currently available medical therapy.W6 Increased age and severe symptoms are not contraindications to operation.

Atrial fibrillation is also an indication for operation. Elimination of the obstruction and coexisting mitral regurgitation can result in a decrease in left atrial size, particularly in younger patients.M37 This size reduction may be an effective form of antiarrhythmic therapy for these individuals.W6 A maze procedure can also be used to treat the atrial fibrillation if it remains refractory to drug treatment (see Chapter 16).

These indications may be extended to include less symptomatic patients with severe gradients, particularly if there is substantial coexisting mitral regurgitation or a history of syncope or unexplained cardiac arrest,B7 as well as to asymptomatic younger patients with gradients greater than 100 mmHg. Septectomy can be justified because of low operative risk and potential to reduce risk of sudden death.

Because most patients with HOCM achieve satisfactory relief of LV outflow tract obstruction and relief of symptoms with septal myectomy, and because of the disadvantages of a prosthetic mitral valve, mitral valve replacement is reserved for specific situations. These include a ventricular septum that is thin (<18 mm) or has unusual morphology,M29,M31 inability to achieve an adequate myectomy,M29 structural abnormalities of the mitral valve that are not amenable to repair and are associated with moderate or severe mitral regurgitation, and recurrence or persistence of ventricular outflow obstruction after previous myectomy.K1,K11,R4 Mitral valve replacement may be appropriate therapy for midventricular obstruction when extended myectomy is ineffective or substantial mitral regurgitation persists after adequate myectomy.K7 There is general agreement, even among its advocates, that mitral valve replacement should be reserved for severely symptomatic patients with a substantial (>50 mmHg) resting LV outflow gradient who fulfill these criteria.K10

Because coronary artery bypass grafting alone does not relieve symptoms in patients with HOCM and coronary artery occlusive disease,G1,S27 myectomy and bypass grafting are indicated when the two conditions coexist.

# SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

# Alternative Therapies

*Percutaneous Transluminal Septal Myocardial Ablation* Ablation of septal myocardium by percutaneous transluminal infusion of alcohol into the appropriate septal branches of the LAD results in infarction and localized thinning of the basal septal myocardium, enlargement of the LV outflow tract, and reduction of the outflow gradient.F1,S16 No randomized trials comparing alcohol septal ablation with septal myectomy have been performed. Zeng and colleagues conducted a metaanalysis of three studies with adequate data to compare the two methods of treatment and demonstrated similar early mortality, reduced intraventricular septal thickness, increased LV end-diastolic dimension, and short-term improvement in NYHA functional class.Z1 Septal ablation was associated with less reduction in the LV outflow tract gradient and greater need for permanent pacing (21% vs. 4.4%) than was surgical myotomy.

A study from Toronto General Hospital comparing 48 patients undergoing myectomy with 54 having septal ablation demonstrated substantial clinical improvement in both groups.R2 However, after propensity adjustment, patients treated with alcohol ablation had higher postprocedure resting (*P* = .002) and provocable (*P* = .004) outflow tract gradients, more SAM (*P* = .01), and higher NYHA classification (*P* = .05) at most recent follow-up. Substantially more patients achieved the defined optimal outcome after myectomy (survival, NYHA functional class I, no postprocedure pacemaker, and follow-up resting LV outflow gradient of <20 mmHg) than after septal ablation (73% vs. 22%, *P* = .001). A high prevalence of SAM (78%) was also noted among 37 patients from Massachusetts General Hospital who had septal ablation.D4 Patients with persistent SAM had more anterior malposition of the mitral valve and less reduction in mitral regurgitation than those without SAM.

Sorajja and colleagues from Mayo Clinic observed a procedural complication in 27% (death 1.5%, CL 0.5%-3.5%; sustained ventricular arrhythmias 3%, CL 1.5%-5.4%; tamponade 3%, CL 1.5%-5.4%; pacemaker implantation 20%, CL 16%- 24%) of 134 patients treated with alcohol septal ablation.S21 This was more than combined complications of 5% (death, tamponade, ventricular arrhythmia, pacemaker implantation) among an age- and sex-matched cohort of patients who underwent myectomy (*P* = .0001). Four-year survival was similar in the two groups, but survival free of severe symptoms was significantly lower for patients having septal ablation who were 65 years of age or younger (Fig. 19-14).

Myectomy can be successfully performed after failed alcohol ablation, but with a higher risk of heart block than in cases where only surgery is performed. Otherwise, alcohol ablation does not appear to adversely affect surgical outcome.N1

In general, alcohol ablation should be reserved for specific patient subgroups such as the elderly, those with significant comorbidity and relative contraindications to myectomy, and those with a strong preference for avoiding operation (Table 19-1).M4,S21

# *Dual-Chamber Pacing*

Dual-chamber (DDD) pacing decreases the subaortic pressure gradient and relieves associated symptoms in some patients with HOCM.J1,M28,S17 The mechanism by which the gradient is decreased is uncertain but may be related to decreased septal motion, which results in increased LV outflow tract area and reduced SAM of the anterior mitral leaflet, late activation of the basal septum, or decreased LV contractility.T7,W6 Not all patients respond favorably to pacing.M18,S17 Two studies with follow-up extending to 10 and 12 years have demonstrated sustained improvement in symptoms and reduction of the LV outflow tract gradient in most patients.M35,T7 In the study by Topilski and colleagues,T7 positive results were attributed to periodic assessment and optimization of pacemaker function. DDD pacing may be of particular value in the elderly and other patients who are not candidates for myectomy or septal ablation (see Table 19-1).

#### *Cardioverter-Defibrillator*

Patients with HOCM and unexplained syncope, cardiac arrest, and ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation should be considered for implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator in combination with myectomy or other surgical procedures.F4 Implantation may be indicated in some patients with nonobstructive HCM who have a history of cardiac arrest or unexplained syncope and in whom physiologic testing is positive.F4,W6

#### *Cardiac Transplantation*

Cardiac transplantation should be considered for suitable candidates with HOCM who have not responded to maximal medical and surgical therapy. These patients usually have intractable symptoms of heart failure associated with dilated ventricular cavities.S15

### *Left Ventricular–Aortic Conduit*

A valved conduit from the apex of the LV to the thoracic or abdominal aorta has been inserted in patients with HOCM.C11,D5,R6 This procedure should be used only when other methods of surgical treatment are infeasible.
