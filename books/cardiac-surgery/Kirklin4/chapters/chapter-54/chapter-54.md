#### DEFINITION

Double outlet left ventricle (DOLV) is a cardiac anomaly in which both great arteries arise from the left ventricle (LV).1 The great arteries are assigned to one or the other ventricle by the rules described under Definition in Chapter 53.

DOLV may occur with atrioventricular (AV) concordant or discordant connection, as does double outlet right ventricle (DORV; see Chapter 53). DOLV with AV discordant connection is discussed in Chapter 55. DOLV, like DORV, may also occur in patients with univentricular AV connections (see Chapter 56) and in those with atrial isomerism (see Chapter 58).

# HISTORICAL NOTE

Marechal is credited with describing the first case of DOLV in 1819, but this was in a heart with double inlet LV with an infundibular outlet chamber.M1 The first reported case in a heart with two ventricles and without pulmonary stenosis was that of Sakakibara and colleagues in 1967, for which they performed a successful intraventricular repair.S1 DOLV is therefore another congenital cardiac anomaly that remained, for all practical purposes, undescribed until the advent of intracardiac surgery. It is also of interest that the first case reported by Potts and colleagues as tetralogy of Fallot and receiving a side-to-side aortopulmonary artery anastomosisP3 underwent subsequent repair for well-documented DOLV with pulmonary stenosis (John Kirklin: personal communication; 1983). A unique case of DOLV with an intact ventricular septum was reported by Paul and colleagues in 1970, establishing with certainty the existence of the entity.P2 Subsequent reports expanded the surgical possibilities by reporting reconstruction of the pulmonary pathway in cases in which a completely intraventricular repair was not possible, usually by a valved extracardiac conduit from the right ventricle to pulmonary trunk.K1,P1 Anderson and colleagues reported the sixth case of DOLV in 1974.A1 Sharratt and colleagues in 1976 reported use of a Fontan-type procedure in hearts with DOLV and severe right ventricular hypoplasia.S2

Five cases were added to the literature in 1976.B3 Additional cases have been reported by Urban and colleagues and Stegmann and colleagues.S4,U1

# MORPHOLOGY AND MORPHOGENESIS

As with DORV, there is great variability among hearts with DOLV and AV concordant connection. Because of its rarity, generalizations are even more difficult than for DORV.

The adjectives *left* and *right* used to modify atrium or ventricle mean *morphologically* left and *morphologically* right. *Position* of the chamber is referred to as *right-sided* or *left-sided*.

![](_page_1_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 54-1** Models of the four basic hearts as they occur in double outlet left ventricle, depicting usual positions of great arteries (aorta medial to pulmonary trunk). Models 2 and 3 depict atrioventricular discordant connection. In the Van Praagh convention, first letter (S or I) refers to atrial position (solitus or inversus), second letter (D or L) to ventricular loop (right or left), and third letter to position of origin of aorta relative to origin of pulmonary trunk (see Appendix 1H in Chapter 1). Key: *LA*, Left atrium; *LV*, left ventricle; *RA*, right atrium; *RV*, right ventricle.

Diagnosis can be ambiguus, because some override of one of the great arteries is commonly present. Defining a DOLV based on 50% or more of great arterial override may result in a substantially higher number of cases being reported. Many patients with complete transposition of the great arteries with subaortic ventricular septal defect (VSD), pulmonary stenosis, and a variable degree of aortic override have been misclassified as having DOLV. An exclusive or near-exclusive origin of both great arteries from the left ventricle (<20% override) will identify the classic form of DOLV and prevent misdiagnosis.<sup>M4</sup> Although it was initially thought bilateral absent conus was a prerequisite for the diagnosis of DOLV, all possible conal configurations have been described: subpulmonic, subaortic, bilaterally present, and bilaterally absent. When present, the length of conus under either great artery is typically relatively short and is an important factor in causing the great artery to embryologically align with the left ventricle.VI

A segmental approach is necessary for complete understanding of this malformation (see "Terminology and Classification of Heart Disease" in Chapter 1). B3,V2 DOLV occurs in each of the four basic hearts (Fig. 54-1) but is most common in hearts with atrial situs solitus and ventricular right-handedness or D-loop (S,D,D). B2,M4 Morphologic characteristics of the VSD and its relationship to the great arteries at the level of the semilunar valves are similar to those in DORV and described by terms defined in "Ventricular Septal Defect" under Morphology in Chapter 53. Subaortic VSD is the most common, followed by subpulmonic, and then by doubly committed. VSD remote from the great arteries is rare M4 (Table 54-1). Absence of a VSD (intact ventricular septum) is also rare but has been described. B1

# Atrial Situs Solitus and Ventricular Right-Handedness (D-Loop) (Atrioventricular Concordant Connection)

In this subset, the aorta is usually in D-malposition (S,D,D), but examples occur with it in L-malposition (S,D,L) (see "Symbolic Convention of Van Praagh" in Chapter 1). In the former, the great arteries may appear in relatively normal position (aorta to the right and somewhat posterior to pulmonary trunk), side to side, or with aorta somewhat anterior to the pulmonary trunk.  $^{\rm B2}$

Data from Menon and Hagler.<sup>M4</sup> Key: *VSD*, Ventricular septal defect.

#### Ventricular Septal Defect

The ventricular septum is rarely intact. P2 Usually, a large VSD is present and lies between the limbs of the trabecula septomarginalis (septal band).

Most commonly, the VSD is *subaortic* in position (Fig. 54-2; see Table 54-1). It may extend back to the tricuspid anulus, or it may be separated from the anulus by a muscular bridge. B2 When the aorta overrides the VSD and arises in part from the right ventricle, the VSD is *juxtaaortic*, and this entity begins to merge with transposition of the great arteries.

When the VSD is subpulmonary, it is usually more anterior and well separated from the tricuspid valve by a rather wide band of muscle. In some cases, the pulmonary trunk origin overrides the VSD and lies in part over the right ventricle. Malalignment of conal septum may be present and can cause aortic outflow obstruction and be associated with aortic arch hypoplasia. M4

Occasionally the VSD is juxtaarterial and lies immediately below both great arteries (*doubly committed*; see Chapter 53, Fig. 53-6). The VSD is typically very large, and there is absence or near absence of conus bilaterally, resulting in aortic-mitral and pulmonary-mitral fibrous continuity and side-by-side great arteries. It is frequently difficult to decide whether DOLV or DORV is present, in which case the term *double outlet both ventricles* is appropriate.<sup>B3</sup>

#### Conal Pattern

Most often there is absence of a subaortic conus and presence of aortic-mitral fibrous continuity and a subpulmonary conus displaced into the LV (Fig. 54-3). Rarely, bilaterally absent conus permits aortic-mitral-tricuspid and pulmonary-tricuspid fibrous continuity (see Fig. 54-2). In this event, both semilunar valves arise at the same level. Very rarely, only a subaortic conus is present. There may be a conus bilaterally.

#### Pulmonary Stenosis

Pulmonary stenosis is present in most cases and is either valvar (sometimes with anular stenosis) or subvalvar when it is due to a restrictive subpulmonary conus with secondary fibrosis of the ostium. When the VSD is subaortic and there is infundibular pulmonary stenosis, the great arteries are usually relatively normally interrelated. B2

#### Right Ventricular and Tricuspid Valve Hypoplasia

There is a tendency for the right ventricular sinus and tricuspid valve to be at least somewhat hypoplastic. B2 The

Aortic valve *(AoV)* is bicuspid but otherwise normal. Ventricular septal defect *(VSD)* is subaortic, with its upper margin separated from AoV by 4 mm. Tricuspid valve *(TV)* is visible through VSD (Ebstein anomaly of tricuspid valve is present). **B,** Close-up of LV outflow tract before aorta was opened. Pulmonary valve *(PV)* is not stenotic, and AoV and PV are in continuity, separated only by a thin fibrous ridge called the *truncal septum (TS).* There is both PV and aortic–mitral valve *(MV)* fibrous continuity (i.e., conus is absent bilaterally). (From Brandt and colleagues.B3)

extreme example is coexistence of tricuspid atresia, with the two reported cases having ventricular right-handedness (S,D,D).V2,V3 Rarely, the tricuspid valve may show an Ebstein anomaly.B3

#### *Left Ventricle*

B

The LV is usually well formed. One case of mitral atresia with large LV and infundibular outlet chamber (S,D,D segmental arrangement) has been reported.V2

#### *Conduction System*

Position of AV node and bundle of His is normal. Thus, the bundle penetrates from a normally positioned posterior AV node through the right trigone in the region of the commissure between tricuspid septal and anterior leaflets and at the base of the noncoronary aortic cusp, and its two branches distribute in normal fashion. Whether it is at risk during repair depends on the relationship of the lower VSD margin to the tricuspid anulus (see "Location in Septum and Relationship to Conduction System" under Morphology in Section 1 of Chapter 35).

Atrial Situs Inversus and Ventricular Left-Handedness (L-Loop) (Atrioventricular Concordant Connection)

Both I,L,L and I,L,D arrangements have been reported (i.e., aorta to the left or right), although both are rare. Usually the VSD is subaortic, and pulmonary stenosis coexists.

#### CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

#### Pathophysiology

In hearts with DOLV and AV concordant connection, the LV is a common mixing chamber, receiving pulmonary venous blood through the mitral valve and caval blood through the right ventricle and VSD. Clinical presentation, however, is dominated by varying degrees of cyanosis due to a combination of the frequent occurrence of pulmonary stenosis and streaming caused by the variable malposition of the great arteries and their relationship to the VSD. Thus, streaming of desaturated right ventricular blood into the aorta may occur when the VSD is subaortic, leading to unexpectedly severe cyanosis. In the absence of pulmonary stenosis, heart failure often develops early in life because of large pulmonary blood flow.

In hearts with DOLV and AV discordant connection, the LV receives caval blood through the mitral valve, and pulmonary venous blood through the right ventricle and VSD. The tendency to develop severe cyanosis is more likely than in AV concordant connection.

#### Examination

MV

Physical findings, chest radiograph, and electrocardiogram are not diagnostic, but reflect cardiopulmonary physiology in each case.

#### Echocardiography

Echocardiography with color flow imaging may be diagnostic, and associated morphologic lesions are readily detected.M2,M5 The main challenge is to distinguish DOLV from other, more common conotruncal anomalies such as transposition of the great arteries and DORV (Fig. 54-4). The focus is on defining the VSD and the relationship of the VSD to the two great arteries, presence or absence of conus under each great artery, presence or absence of pulmonary stenosis, and positioning of the two great arteries in relation to each other. Coronary artery pattern is also important because some surgical repair techniques used for DOLV require specific knowledge of coronary artery course. Other imaging studies are not usually performed unless clinical presentation indicates that specific and quantitative knowledge of physiology of the pulmonary vasculature is important in formulating the management plan. Even with increased recognition of DOLV by echocardiography, diagnosis may be elusive. In a recent experience with six patients with both echocardiography and cardiac catheterization available, diagnosis was made preoperatively in four patients and intraoperatively in two.M3

Non-opaque flow outlines tricuspid *(T)* and mitral *(M)* valves opening into their respective ventricles. Tricuspid anulus is smaller than mitral anulus, but right ventricle *(RV)* is not hypoplastic compared with left ventricle *(LV).* Distance between aortic and mitral valves in this view is within normal range and consistent with aortic-mitral fibrous continuity. **B,** Systolic LAO frame confirms subaortic position of VSD. Position of upper margin of basal septum (i.e., lower margin of VSD; *large arrow*) indicates that aorta *(A)* arises from LV, except for rightward anterior sinus, which arises from RV free wall. Conal septum *(C)* is entirely within LV. **C,** Diastolic frame in right anterior oblique (RAO) projection with LV injection of contrast. Low position of aortic root showing a normal relationship to intact atrioventricular septum *(arrow)* suggests a normal deficiency of subaortic conus. Overlap of aorta *(A)* indicates (by correlating with LAO views) that it is to the right and slightly anterior to pulmonary *(P)* trunk. **D,** Systolic RAO frame shows severe narrowing of subpulmonary conus, indicating its muscular nature. (From Brandt and colleagues.B3)

# Cardiac Catheterization and Cineangiography

Biplane cineangiography, selecting injection sites and projections suited to the individual problem, is diagnostic but provides little additional morphologic information beyond that obtained by echocardiography.B3 Because DOLV is rare, cineangiography was once performed to support a diagnosis made by echocardiography, but this role has now been overtaken by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cardiac catheterization, however, remains the only way to obtain specific hemodynamic and oxymetric data if it is necessary to define the physiology of the pulmonary vasculature.

When catheterization is performed, both left and right ventricular injections are desirable.B3,K1 With appropriate projections, angiography can confirm the diagnosis of DOLV and rule out other conotruncal anomalies, but it is rarely necessary in current practice. Angiography can also define the position and number of VSDs, presence and site of pulmonary and aortic stenosis, and size of the right ventricle and tricuspid valve relative to the LV and mitral valve (see Fig. 54-3).

#### Magnetic Resonance and Computed Tomography Imaging

Computed tomography provides no specific advantages over MRI in diagnosing DOLV and thus is not routinely used. MRI may be used to supplement the intracardiac

morphologic information obtained by echocardiography (Fig. 54-5).

#### NATURAL HISTORY

Natural history of patients with DOLV without pulmonary stenosis appears to be similar to that of patients with isolated large VSD (see Natural History in Section 1 of Chapter 35), except that progressive VSD narrowing and closure has not been documented in DOLV. Cyanosis may be present because of the common mixing chamber beneath the great arteries, but considerable streaming of flow is often present and accounts for significant variability in arterial oxygen levels.

Natural history of patients with DOLV and pulmonary stenosis is similar to that of patients with tetralogy of Fallot (see Natural History in Section 1 of Chapter 38), and in both entities the degree of hypoxia and clinical course are directly related to severity of pulmonary stenosis.

# TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

# Identification of Morphology

There are no clues to the specific diagnosis of DOLV from external examination of the heart when it is exposed at operation. Generally, only AV connection—concordant or discordant—can be confirmed by external observation. For this reason, detailed and complete preoperative imaging must be performed to identify all aspects of the anomaly. Even when this has been done, relation of the great arteries to VSD, and VSD to AV valves, may be different from that anticipated from preoperative imaging. Thus, when the heart is opened, accurate evaluation must be made of all aspects of morphology.

When the AV connection is *concordant*, finding a large VSD located far downstream (distally) and anterosuperiorly in the ventricular septum mandates thorough consideration of all diagnostic possibilities associated with a VSD in this position, including not only DOLV but also ordinary subpulmonary VSD with ventriculoarterial concordant connection, tetralogy of Fallot with subpulmonary VSD (if pulmonary stenosis coexists), anterosuperior VSD with complete transposition of the great arteries, DORV with doubly committed VSD, and Taussig-Bing–type DORV (which has its VSD in this same position, but an aorta far removed from the VSD and clearly originating from the right ventricle alone).

When the AV connection is *discordant*, the same detailed observations must be made. These generally reveal findings similar to those of congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (see Chapter 55), but in DOLV, the aorta as well as the pulmonary trunk arise entirely or in large part from the right-sided (in atrial situs solitus) LV.

# Repair of Double Outlet Left Ventricle and Atrioventricular Concordant Connection

Preparations for operation, sternotomy, and placement of purse-string sutures are those generally used (see "Preparation for Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section 3 of Chapter 2). Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is established, perfusate temperature lowered to 25°C, the aorta clamped, and usual techniques of myocardial management instituted (see "Cold Cardioplegia, Controlled Aortic Root Reperfusion, and [When Needed] Warm Cardioplegic Induction" in Chapter 3). The usual oblique right atriotomy is made (see Chapter 30, Fig. 30-14, *A*), and the interior of the right ventricle is inspected through the tricuspid valve. It can usually be confirmed from the right atrium that neither great artery arises wholly or in large part from the right ventricle, and that the VSD is in the outlet portion of the ventricular septum.

Usually, repair is made through a vertical incision in the distal portion of the right ventricle. After placing stay sutures, position of VSD, origin of aorta and pulmonary trunk from LV and their relationships to the VSD, and the nature of any pulmonary stenosis are verified.

#### *With Pulmonary Stenosis*

When pulmonary stenosis is present in a DOLV, it is usually not possible to relieve it directly and do a completely intraventricular repair, as is described for patients with no coexisting pulmonary stenosis. However, if examination of the pulmonary valve through a vertical anterior incision in the pulmonary trunk or through the ventricle shows it to be widely patent and the subvalvar fibromuscular obstructing ring localized, the ring may be excised satisfactorily, permitting a completely intraventricular repair.

Usually the pulmonary anulus is small and the subvalvar stenosis too long and narrow for a simple intraventricular repair to be effective. It is not possible to place a transanular patch, because the left anterior descending coronary artery is immediately in front of the pulmonary anulus, and a valved extracardiac conduit or a variant of the Lecompte operation (réparation à l'étage ventriculaire [REV]) is necessary. In the former, the pulmonary trunk is transected at the sinutubular junction, and the proximal pulmonary trunk stump is oversewn by placing two rows of continuous polypropylene sutures at the level of the valve. Then the VSD is closed by suturing into place a patch, taking the usual precautions to avoid damaging the bundle of His (Fig. 54-6, *A*). An

![](_page_5_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Figure 54-6** Repair of double outlet left ventricle and pulmonary stenosis *(PS)*. **A,** Aorta *(Ao)* is to right and slightly posterior to pulmonary trunk *(PT)*. Right ventricle (RV) has been opened by a vertical incision. Ventricular septal defect *(VSD)* is closed with a patch. In this example, a band of muscle lies between VSD and tricuspid valve *(TV)*, so bundle of His is away from posterior border of VSD, and sutures for patch closure can be placed in muscular border of defect. **B,** Repair is completed by placing an allograft-valved conduit between RV and PT. Distal anastomosis is performed end to end between conduit and distal portion of transected PT. Pulmonary artery is transected at sinutubular junction (not shown), and proximal PT stump is oversewn with a two-layer running polypropylene suture at level of pulmonary valve. (It is important to avoid a blind pouch of proximal PT, as this may serve as a nidus for thrombus.) This suture line should be constructed with particular caution; it is at systemic pressure and relatively inaccessible following conduit placement. Proximal conduit to RV anastomosis is then performed in a fashion similar to that for tetralogy with pulmonary atresia (see Technique of Operation in Section II of Chapter 38). Key: *APM,* Anterior papillary muscle; *SVC,* superior vena cava.

allograft-valved extracardiac conduit is prepared (see Figs. 38-77 and 38-78 in Chapter 38) and sutured distally to the pulmonary trunk and proximally to the right ventriculotomy (Fig. 54-6, *B*). Returning to the right atrium, the foramen ovale is closed, and the remainder of the operation is completed in the usual manner.

Alternatively, a Lecompte operation (REV) can be performed (see "Lecompte Intraventricular Repair" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 53). This has the great advantage of not requiring an extracardiac conduit. Transfer of the pulmonary trunk to the right ventricle can be accomplished without the need to transect and reconstruct the aorta.C1,D1

Patch augmentation of the right ventricular outflow tract may be possible in selected cases of DOLV with pulmonary stenosis. For this to be possible, the pulmonary trunk must be either anterior or side by side relative to the aorta, and the coronary arteries must course behind the pulmonary rootS3 (Fig. 54-7).

# *Without Pulmonary Stenosis*

When pulmonary stenosis is not present, the morphologic arrangements may allow intraventricular tunnel repair. A contoured patch is placed into the VSD so that the right ventricle ejects into the pulmonary trunk while the LV continues to eject into the aorta. The VSD may have to be enlarged anteriorly and superiorly before this is done. When an intraventricular tunnel repair is not possible, the pulmonary orifice is closed off from within the ventricle or from within the pulmonary trunk, or the pulmonary trunk is divided; the VSD is closed, leaving the aorta coming off the LV; and an allograft-valved extracardiac conduit is placed between the right ventricle and pulmonary trunk. Alternatively, the pulmonary trunk can be connected to the right ventricle by the Lecompte operation (REV). If the pulmonary valve is relatively normal in size (with or without subpulmonic stenosis), the pulmonary root, including the valve, can be translocated to the right ventricle in the same fashion. This has been described in patients with DOLV who have a subpulmonic conus.C1,D1 Additionally, the intact pulmonary valve and root can be translocated to the right ventricle even when a subpulmonary conus is absent, as described by Hanley and colleaguesM3 (Fig. 54-8). Pulmonary root translocation in the presence of severe pulmonary stenosis, using a monocusp valve and patch augmentation of the small pulmonary anulus, has also been described.O1

Rarely, in the absence of pulmonary stenosis, are these types of repair not possible. It may then be possible to close the VSD with a contoured patch so the right ventricle ejects into the aorta and the LV into the pulmonary trunk, and to

Through a right ventriculotomy and ventricular septal defect *(VSD)*, aortic *(AV)* and mitral *(MV)* valves can be visualized in LV. **B,** Two separate polytetrafluoroethylene patches *(PP)* have been used to close VSD and defect in LV created from excision of pulmonary root. If pulmonary-mitral fibrous continuity is present, patch on LV will be partially sewn to anterior mitral leaflet hinge point. Posterior rim of mobilized pulmonary root *(PT)* is sutured to superior aspect of right ventriculotomy. **C,** Procedure is completed by creating a hood *(PH)* across anterior aspect of anastomosis.

complete the operation by performing an arterial switch procedure (see "Arterial Switch Operation" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 52).

#### Double Outlet Left Ventricle with Atrioventricular Concordant Connection and Important Hypoplasia of Right Ventricle and Tricuspid Valve

An important degree of hypoplasia of the right ventricle and tricuspid valve (see later text on Indications for Operation) makes the types of repair described in the preceding text inadvisable. A Fontan operation may be performed (see Technique of Operation and Indications for Operation in Chapter 41), or one combining an intracardiac septation with a bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis ("one-and-a-half" ventricle repair; see Chapter 40).

# SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Postoperative care follows the usual protocols (see Chapter 5).

# RESULTS

# Survival

#### *Early (Hospital) Death*

In the current era, hospital mortality is expected to be about 5%, based on recent reports of patients doing well after surgical correction.C1,D1,M3 Total number of surgically managed cases reported, however, is only several dozen. The experience of McElhinney and colleagues has been updated to include six patients undergoing intracardiac repair, with no early or midterm deaths (FL Hanley: personal communication; 2002).M3

#### *Time-Related Survival*

The number of cases is so small, and variability of the anomaly and repairs so great, little useful information is available about time-related survival and risk factors for death. However, these are probably similar to those for DORV (see Fig. 53-19 in Chapter 53) and transposition, VSD, and LV outflow obstruction (see Figs. 52-53 and Figs. 52-54 in Chapter 52).

#### Other Outcome Events

The small number of patients and variability in the morphology and surgical procedures mitigate against obtaining sufficient information in this area to draw reasonable inferences.

When an allograft-valved extracardiac conduit is used, reoperation will probably be necessary at some time (see "Reoperation" under Results in Section II of Chapter 38).

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Diagnosis of DOLV is an indication for operation. When pulmonary stenosis coexists, Lecompte intraventricular repair (REV; see Chapter 53) may be considered optimal, and in this case, young age is not a contraindication. Conduit repair may be performed in infancy, accepting the need for early reoperation and conduit replacement. Classic shunting operations (see Chapter 38) remain an alternative. Arguments for and against this approach are similar to those outlined for tetralogy of Fallot (see Chapter 38).

In the absence of pulmonary stenosis, corrective operation should usually be performed in the first 6 months of life if preoperative imaging studies support the likely success of a completely intraventricular repair. Alternatively, but less desirably, pulmonary trunk banding may be performed if the patient has heart failure or if pulmonary vascular resistance is rising, and repair delayed until later in life. Ideal timing of the subsequent repair may be influenced by morphology. If preoperative imaging studies suggest that a completely intraventricular repair will be straightforward, repair can be pursued at age 1 to 2 years. If morphology is more challenging for a completely intraventricular repair, some believe it may be of benefit to delay repair beyond age 2 years to maximize the likelihood of success. The logic underlying this approach is not proven, but the argument is that a complex intracardiac baffle is more likely to remain unobstructed over time if operation is performed in a more fully grown patient.

When there is right ventricular and tricuspid valvar hypoplasia, with *z* value for diameter of the tricuspid valve less than −2, a Fontan operation (see Chapter 41) or, alternatively, the "one-and-a-half" ventricle repair (see Chapter 40) should be considered. Usual indications, timing, and techniques of the Fontan operation are used (see Chapter 41).
