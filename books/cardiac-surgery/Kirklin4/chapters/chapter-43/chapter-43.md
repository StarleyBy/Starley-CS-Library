# DEFINITION

Truncus arteriosus (persistent truncus arteriosus, truncus arteriosus communis, common aorticopulmonary trunk) is a congenital cardiovascular malformation in which one great artery arising from the base of the heart by way of a single semilunar (truncal) valve gives origin to the coronary, systemic, and one or two pulmonary arteries proximal to the origin of the brachiocephalic branches. It is one of several diagnoses within the phylum of common ventriculoatrial junction (see [http://www.ipccc.net/\)](http://www.ipccc.net/). A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is almost always present beneath the truncal valve.

This definition excludes those hearts in which there are no true pulmonary arteries and in which the lungs are supplied only by large aortopulmonary arteries (Collett and Edwards type IVC7), characteristic of tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary atresia with absence of the pulmonary trunk and the central and hilar portions of the right and left pulmonary arteries (see "Morphology" under Tetralogy of Fallot with Pulmonary Atresia in Section II of Chapter 38). Excluded also from discussion in this chapter are hearts with a common arterial trunk but an intact ventricular septum.A2 Whether hearts in which there is a VSD but no interventricular communication during diastole (because the semilunar cusps close against the crest of the ventricular septum) should be considered to have an intact septum is controversial.A5,C2,D6,V2

#### HISTORICAL NOTE

The first well-documented case of truncus arteriosus was reported by Wilson in 1798,W4 and existence of the entity was confirmed by accurate clinical and autopsy reports of a 6-month-old infant by Buchanan in 1864.B11 In the early literature, there was frequent confusion with a single arterial trunk and, although Vievordt clarified this aspect in 1898 (quoted by Victoria and colleaguesV3), confusion existed as late as 1930 when ShapiroS5 distinguished it from hearts with aortic and pulmonary atresia. Lev and Saphir proposed the basic morphologic criteria defining the anomaly in 1942,L5 and in 1949 Collett and EdwardsC7 reviewed previously published cases and proposed a classification. An alternative classification was suggested by the Van Praaghs in 1965.V2

Surgical treatment was initially confined to banding of one or both pulmonary arteries.A9,H6,S9 Intracardiac repair was first successfully accomplished in 1962 at the University of Michigan using a nonvalved polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) conduit; the patient was alive and well 11 years later.B3 Experimental work using ascending aortic allografts including the aortic valve was reported from Japan by Arai and colleagues in 1965A8 and by Rastelli and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic in 1967.R2,S4 Before this, in 1966, Ross and Somerville had successfully used an ascending aortic allograft in reconstructing tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia.R3

McGoon and colleagues were the first to successfully repair truncus arteriosus using an ascending aortic allograft and valve conduit (cylinder) in September 1967.M5,W1 Weldon and Cameron reported a successful repair in 1967.W2 Binet used a xenograft valve incorporated within a polyester cylinder in 1971 (see discussion of paper by Moore and colleaguesM13), and Bowman and colleagues reported use of a glutaraldehyde-treated porcine aortic valve in a polyester cylinder in 1973.B8

The first successful conduit repair in infancy was carried out in a 6-week-old infant by Barratt-Boyes in 1971, as reported by Girinath.G3

# MORPHOGENESIS AND MORPHOLOGY

# Morphogenesis

Deletion of chromosome 22q11 is present in a substantial number of patients with conotruncal abnormalities. About one third of subjects with truncus arteriosus have been found to have 22q11 deletion,G4,M12 and many of these have additional characteristic features of DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome, or conotruncal face syndrome. As such, their natural history and also their course following operation may be complicated by hypocalcemia, palatal abnormalities, learning disability, and other noncardiac problems.

#### Morphology

Truncus arteriosus is classified based on origins of the pulmonary arteries from the truncal artery (Collett and EdwardsC7) and also on degree of development of the ascending aorta and ductus arteriosus in cases with a single pulmonary artery (Van Praagh and Van PraaghV2).

#### *Truncal Artery*

The arterial trunk (truncal artery) is larger than a normal aorta and is the only vessel arising from the base of the heart. It originates in part from both ventricles, but usually is more over the right than left ventricle.B5,C8,T2 In an autopsy series of 56 cases, the trunk was equally balanced over both ventricles in 50%. In the remainder, it was either exclusively or predominantly over the right ventricle in 40% and over the left ventricle in 10%.A1 In the unbalanced cases, the VSD was much more likely to be smaller (both shallower and

narrower). From the truncal artery arise the coronary arteries and one or both pulmonary arteries.

# *Pulmonary Arteries*

The pulmonary arteries usually originate just downstream from the truncal valve on the left posterolateral aspect of the truncus artery, although their origin may lie truly laterally, truly posteriorly,A6 or (rarely) anterolaterally (Table 43-1).W3 There is frequently a single orifice leading into a short pulmonary trunk (type I of Collett and Edwards), which then divides into left and right pulmonary arteries that follow a normal course (Figs. 43-1 and 43-2). Alternatively and less commonly, the orifice is double, the left and right branches arising separately side by side (Fig. 43-3) or occasionally with the orifice of the left pulmonary artery superior (anterior) to the right rather than to the left of it (type II of Collett and Edwards). Types I and II merge into each other and are best considered together. They comprise the majority of casesB5,C1,C7,C8 (89% of the Toronto surgical series).W3

Rarely, ostia of left and right pulmonary arteries may be widely separated and arise from opposite lateral walls of the truncal artery at either the same or different levels above the valve (type III of Collett and Edwards). This arrangement poses special problems for repair.S11

Occasionally, only one pulmonary artery originates from the truncal artery. The arterial vascular supply to the opposite lung arises either from a patent ductus arteriosus as a complete branch pulmonary artery or from large aortopulmonary collateral arteries, as in tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia.M8,V1 When the left pulmonary artery is the one that does not originate from the truncus (or is absent), the right often continues to arise from the left posterolateral surface of the proximal truncal artery.C1,V2 The term *hemitruncus* has been used to describe the condition of the common arterial trunk giving rise to only one branch pulmonary artery,G7 but the term is more commonly used to describe the slightly more common "origin of right (or left) pulmonary artery from the aorta." In the latter, of course, there are two separate semilunar valves (see Chapter 45).

Stenosis of the origin of one or both branch pulmonary arteries is more frequent than absence of the origin; it is probably underestimated in autopsy compared with cineangiographic studies. It was noted in five clinical cases (10%) in one series.C1

Orifice of pulmonary trunk arises from truncal artery close to the commissure between right and left cusps of truncal valve. There is lack of continuity between the right posterior division of septal band (trabecula septomarginalis) and ventriculoinfundibular fold, allowing tricuspid–truncal valve fibrous continuity at posteroinferior margin of ventricular septal defect (VSD). Bundle of His therefore lies along this edge of VSD.

**Figure 43-4** Autopsy specimen from 7-day-old neonate with truncus arteriosus (Van Praagh type 4). A large patent ductus arteriosus is similar in diameter to the descending aorta. There is also severe coarctation of the aorta consisting of a short, nearly atretic segment and a hypoplastic arch between left common carotid (LCC) and left subclavian (LSC) arteries. Truncal artery (opened anteriorly) is wider than usual with this arrangement. Origins of left and right pulmonary arteries (not visible in photograph) are widely separated. Key: *AsA,* Ascending aorta; *Brach,* brachiocephalic artery; *D,* patent ductus arteriosus; *Desc Ao,* descending aorta; *LPA,* left pulmonary artery; *RPA,* right pulmonary artery; *Tr,* truncal artery.

# *Ascending Aorta and Ductus Arteriosus*

In truncus arteriosus, there is reciprocal development between ascending and transverse aortic arches (arising from fourth aortic arch) and ductus arteriosus (arising from sixth aortic arch).V2 Thus, in the majority of cases the ascending aorta is a direct continuation of the truncus artery and of about the same diameter (see Fig. 43-1), whereas the ductus arteriosus is usually entirely absent. Rarely a ductus is present with a well-developed arch.M9

By contrast, when the ductus arteriosus is present, the transverse arch is usually absent (interrupted aortic arch) and the ascending aorta is underdeveloped. The ductus is a direct continuation of the truncus artery, arching leftward to join the descending aorta (Fig. 43-4). In this situation, left and right pulmonary artery branches usually arise separately from superior and inferior (leftward and rightward) walls of the truncal artery (type III of Collett and Edwards). The ascending aorta now arises from the superior rightward aspect of the truncus artery as the relatively smaller branch. Usually the transverse aorta is interrupted beyond the origin of the left common carotid artery (type B interrupted aortic arch; see

"Types" under Morphology in Section II of Chapter 48), or there is severe coarctation including tubular hypoplasia of the aortic isthmus and archT3 (see Fig. 43-4). This arrangement (Van Praagh type A4) was present in 12% of the cases of Van Praagh and colleagues and 14% (28 of 303) of the Toronto surgical series.C1,W3

## *Coronary Arteries*

Orifices of the coronary arteries have a variable relationship to the sinuses of Valsalva above the truncal cusps (Fig. 43-5). A minority (≈20%) arise centrally (more or less normally) within the sinuses; about 80% (whether the usual two or a single orifice) are at the margin of the sinus or at the upper margin of a commissure.S13 In at least a third of cases, one coronary orifice (usually the left) is displaced cephalad above the sinutubular ridge and must be differentiated from the pulmonary artery orifices at the time of repair. In about two thirds of cases, the left coronary artery arises from the left posterior aspect of the truncal artery, and the right coronary artery from the right anterior aspect in a position similar to normal.A3,C6 Deviations from this pattern occur in the remainder of cases and include a single ostium (found in 18% of hearts reported by de la Cruz and colleaguesD4), closely approximated right and left ostia, and small, slitlike, or stenotic and kinked proximal left coronary artery.A3,B5,C8,L4,S6,V2

Rarely, a coronary artery may arise from a pulmonary artery rather than the truncal artery; Daskalopoulos and colleagues report the circumflex artery's origin from the right pulmonary artery in a patient in whom pulmonary artery banding was not tolerated.D2 The proximal part of the left anterior descending coronary artery is frequently displaced to the left of the interventricular sulcus and does not reach it until about halfway down the front of the heart. It tends to be small. Larger-than-normal diagonal branches from the

Truncal valve is quadricuspid, with ventricular septal defect (VSD) lying directly beneath its right and pulmonary cusps.

right coronary artery cross the anterior right ventricle inferior to conal branches, contributing to the blood supply of the upper interventricular septum and occasionally part of the left ventricle.A3,B5 Damage to these vessels during surgical repair can seriously compromise the myocardium.A3

# *Semilunar Valve*

The single truncal valve is posterior and inferior in position, similar to the normal aortic valve, although it points more anteriorly.C1 There is fibrous continuity between its posterior cusps and the anterior mitral leaflet, as in the normal heartC1 (Fig. 43-6). It has three cusps in half to two thirds of cases, and four cusps in most of the remainder.S13 Rarely the valve is bicuspid. Not infrequently a raphe is present and partially divides a cusp into two, but it is doubtful whether there are ever more than four well-formed cusps.V2 There may be variations in length and width of individual cusps, but in most patients who survive infancy, the cusps are well formed (see Figs. 43-2 and 43-6). However, in all cases, details of the structure of the truncal valve are different from those of the normal aortic valve.S13

In autopsy material, obvious severe myxomatous thickening of the cusps is present in a third of cases and is much more common in those dying as neonates (Fig. 43-7). Less severe myxomatous changes are present in two thirds of older infants (Fig. 43-8), and microscopic increase in thickness of the distal portions of the cusps is apparent in many more.B2 Severe myxomatous changes often are associated with severe truncal valve regurgitation, and their frequency in autopsy specimens from neonates and young infants corresponds to the high prevalence of truncal valve regurgitation in neonates and young infants who develop severe heart failure or die. These morphologic changes are also reminiscent of those seen in congenital valvar aortic stenosis in the neonate (see "Morphology" in Section I of Chapter 47) and may make the valve stenotic.B12,G2,L3,P3 Rarely, stenosis is contributed to

by commissural fusion.B2 A redundant truncal valve leaflet may obstruct the pulmonary trunk ostium during ventricular ejection when the ostium is proximally placed.C1

# *Ventricular Septal Defect*

The VSD is high, anterior, usually large, and juxtatruncal in position. It is typically stated that the truncal valve forms its superior margin (see Figs. 43-2 and 43-6). Consistent with this observation is the fact that the infundibular septum is absent in truncus arteriosus, so there is no infundibular structure to form the superior margin of the VSD, leaving the superior margin to be formed by the valve itself. Another way to characterize the VSD is to describe it as *U shaped*—that is, with no superior margin. This perspective can be best appreciated if one examines a specimen with the truncal valve leaflets opened to the position they occupy during systole. Inferiorly and anteriorly, the VSD is bounded by the two divisions of the septal band (trabecula septomarginalis [TSM]) and posteriorly by the free wall muscle band that separates the semilunar from the tricuspid valve (the ventriculoinfundibular fold) (see Fig. 43-2).

Usually the junction of the right posterior division of the TSM and ventriculoinfundibular fold forms a muscle bridge that separates the defect from the tricuspid valve and right trigone (see Fig. 43-1) and therefore from the bundle of His.B5,C4,C8,V2 Occasionally, this muscle bridge is absent (see Fig. 43-2) or poorly formed (see Fig. 43-8); the lower margin of the defect then approaches the tricuspid anulus, or the VSD becomes juxtatricuspid in position, in which case the His bundle is at risk of damage during repair.B4 In these hearts, there may be fibrous truncal-tricuspid-mitral valve continuity. Part of the membranous ventricular septum may still be present at the posteroinferior margin of the VSD.

#### *Right Ventricle*

The infundibular (conal) septum is absent from the right ventricular outflow tract.C8,V2 Contrariwise, it has been asserted that the infundibular septum can be recognized fused to the distal anterior (free) right ventricular wall; rarely, there is a persistent blind right ventricular outflow pouch in front of it.V2 The right ventricle is nearly always hypertrophied and enlarged.

#### *Left Ventricle*

In contrast to the right ventricular outflow tract, the left ventricular outflow tract is relatively normal in hearts with truncus arteriosus (see Fig. 43-6), and flow from this chamber into the truncal artery is restricted only in the unusual situation when the truncal artery originates mainly from the right ventricle and the VSD is small. A pressure gradient demonstrable on catheter withdrawal from left ventricle to aorta in such rare instances will lie at the VSD level rather than at the truncal valve. Although a moderate-sized VSD is not restrictive before surgical repair, it may prove so afterward and thus may need to be enlarged at operation (see Technique of Operation later).

#### *Associated Anomalies*

The most common associated cardiac and noncardiac anomalies are shown in Tables 43-2 and 43-3. About 10% to 20% of patients with truncus arteriosus have coexisting interrupted aortic arch or coarctation with patency of the ductus arteriosus.S1 Truncus arteriosus is rarely associated with atrioventricular discordant connection, situs inversus, asplenia or polysplenia, or dextrocardia. Double inlet ventricle is also rare,V2 although mitral stenosis or atresia with left ventricular hypoplasia occurs.

Frequent total absence of the ductus arteriosus has already been mentioned together with association of a widely patent ductus arteriosus in patients in whom there is also aortic arch interruption or, less often, aortic coarctation or atresia. When hearts with aortic arch interruption are excluded, right aortic arch is as common in truncus arteriosus as in tetralogy of Fallot (25%-35%).C1,V2 Anomalous aortic branch origins occur frequently, usually of the subclavian arteries (10%). A persistent left superior vena cava drains to the coronary sinus in about 10% of patients, and occasionally there is partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection. Patent foramen ovale is

common, and atrial septal defect of moderate or large size is found in about 10% of patients. Mitral valve anomalies of various types are present with similar frequency. Other rare lesions include atrioventricular septal defect, double aortic arch,C7 and according to Bharati and colleagues,B5 tricuspid stenosis and (rarely) atresia.

Extracardiac congenital defects are not uncommon and may occasionally contribute to death. DiGeorge syndrome (thymic and parathyroid aplasia or hypoplasia) is known to be associated with truncus arteriosus.F2

# CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

#### Symptoms

Presenting symptoms are almost always tachypnea, tachycardia, irritability, and unwillingness to take either breast or bottle feedings during the early weeks of life, all manifestations of heart failure.A4 Rarely, respiratory distress is aggravated by compression of the left upper lobe bronchus between an anteriorly placed left pulmonary artery and the posterior aortic arch.C1,H1 Even more rarely, an aneurysmal truncal artery associated with interrupted aortic arch may severely compress the right main bronchus and produce total right lung collapse. Mild cyanosis accompanies these symptoms in about one third of cases but rarely is the

presenting feature. By contrast, in those infants who survive for longer periods, recurrent respiratory infections, dyspnea, and failure to thrive are usually present, and cyanosis is more apparent secondary to rising pulmonary vascular resistance. Older children may occasionally present with increasing cyanosis (Eisenmenger syndrome) and fail to give a history of heart failure in infancy.

#### Physical Examination

On examination, signs of heart failure are accompanied by a jerky to collapsing arterial pulse produced by rapid runoff from the truncal artery into the pulmonary arteries. The heart is overactive, and a prominent left parasternal systolic murmur and often thrill are appreciated. There is frequently an ejection click coinciding with full opening of the truncal valve,A10 and an apical gallop rhythm may be present, although it is surprisingly rare in neonates. An aortic early diastolic murmur (from truncal valve regurgitation) is highly suggestive of truncus arteriosus, particularly when it is accompanied by pulmonary plethora on chest radiograph and right aortic arch. The second heart sound is usually single but split in about one third of cases. A continuous murmur is noted occasionally and is most often due to stenosis at the origin of one or both pulmonary arteries. Important truncal valve stenosis is a confusing feature and usually results in diminished peripheral pulses accompanied by a harsh ejection systolic murmur and thrill, maximal in the right upper intercostal spaces.B12,L2

## Chest Radiography

Chest radiography shows marked cardiomegaly as well as plethoric lung fields in neonates and infants. The pulmonary trunk segment is deficient (as in transposition), but a high origin or arching of the left pulmonary artery may be evident in older children as a "comma" sign on the left upper mediastinal border.C1 A solitary right pulmonary artery arising from the left side of the truncus artery may give a similar appearance. The hemithorax may be smaller and vascularity less on the side of the "absent" branch pulmonary artery (when this lung is supplied by bronchial collaterals or by a relatively small patent ductus arteriosus). In truncus arteriosus with aortic arch interruption, the descending aorta is often prominent in the chest radiograph.C1 In those few infants who survive without treatment, pulmonary plethora subsides, as does cardiomegaly, from increasing pulmonary vascular disease.

# Electrocardiography

Electrocardiography (ECG) usually shows combined ventricular hypertrophy and a normal or slightly rightward axis, although left ventricular hypertrophy is usually dominant in the tracing (occasionally it is absent).C1 P pulmonale can occur.V3

# Echocardiography

Two-dimensional echocardiography can be diagnostic and is usually definitive, with infrequent occurrence of only minor errorsT7 (Fig. 43-9). It demonstrates a single vessel overriding the ventricular septum and reveals abnormalities in the truncal valve cusps.A10,H2,P3 In addition, origins of pulmonary arteries can be predicted with some accuracy, and presence of major associated abnormalities, particularly interrupted aortic arch, can be determined.

# Cardiac Catheterization and Angiography

Cardiac catheterization and angiography may still be performed in the occasional neonate or young infant to define the pulmonary arteries, and hemodynamic state when there

Left pulmonary artery has an atretic proximal component. Left lung is supplied by aortopulmonary collateral arteries.

is an atypical physiologic presentation, such as severe cyanosis, or when there is suspicion on echocardiography that the pulmonary artery morphology is complex (e.g., unilateral aortopulmonary collaterals). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) compete with traditional angiography when structural details and some physiologic details require definition (see "Computed Tomography Angiography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging" later). There is an absolute indication for catheterization in patients who present after 6 months of life to define the status of the pulmonary microvasculature.

In neonates and young infants with typical physiology, there is left-to-right shunting at the ventricular level with a high pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow ratio (Qp/Q s) and systemic pressures in the right ventricle and pulmonary artery. The high pulmonary blood flow keeps aortic oxygen saturation at 85% or more.M2 Pulmonary vascular resistance is mildly raised (2-4 units · m2 ). Atypical physiology may occur. Rarely, when the VSD is restrictive and the truncal origin is mainly from the right ventricle, left ventricular pressure may exceed that in the right. When there is truncal valve stenosis, there is a withdrawal gradient across it. The site of stenosis may be difficult to identify preoperatively. Pulmonary artery pressure is often slightly below systemic pressure, but it is importantly reduced when there is stenosis at the origin of one or the other artery.

The progressive rise in pulmonary vascular resistance that occurs in virtually all children who survive infancy is associated with a fall in Qp and therefore in arterial oxygen saturation. Arterial oxygen saturations less than 80% are usually an indication that pulmonary vascular resistance is beyond the operable range.M2

Cineangiography with contrast injections into both ventricles and ascending aorta demonstrates the exact site of origin of the pulmonary arteries and differentiates this lesion from patent ductus arteriosus. Special views are required to demonstrate the origin of right and left pulmonary artery branches to assess any proximal stenosis. Should one pulmonary artery fail to outline after routine contrast injections, the origin and distribution of the blood supply to the other lung must be identified. This is usually possible by injections into the upper descending thoracic aorta and its branches, defining either a ductus or large collaterals. In addition, a pulmonary vein wedge injection can be used to retrogradely fill true pulmonary arteries that fill either inadequately or not at all from an aortic injection.

These studies also provide information on alignment of the truncal artery and truncal valve with the two ventricles, truncal valve cusp thickening, and truncal valve stenosis or regurgitation. A bicuspid or quadricuspid valve may show doming in systole without stenosis being present. Site of the VSD is demonstrated, as are the two ventricles.

# Computed Tomography Angiography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging

CT angiography (CTA) and MRI are not routinely indicated, but these imaging modalities may be indicated in specific circumstances in both neonates and older children. CTA provides excellent spatial resolution (Fig. 43-10). When echocardiography suggests complex pulmonary artery problems such as stenosis or discontinuity, but there is no concern about pulmonary vascular resistance, CTA can

define the morphologic details, and cardiac catheterization can be avoided (Fig. 43-11). MRI can quantify the regurgitant fraction of an abnormal truncal valve, providing objective data for longitudinal follow-up and decision making (Fig. 43-12).

### NATURAL HISTORY

Truncus arteriosus is rare, occurring in 2.8% of cases of congenital heart disease in the cardiac registry report by Calder and colleaguesC1 and in 1.7% of the autopsy series of Tandon and colleagues.T1 The natural history of patients with truncus arteriosus is unfavorable. No series follow a cohort of patients from birth, so exact data are not available. However, several studies when taken in aggregate provide an accurate estimate of survival without surgical treatment. Marcelletti and colleagues report on 23 cases prior to the era of intervention.M3 Ten patients presented in the neonatal or infancy period (Table 43-4). Additional reports of autopsy cases by Calder and the Van Praaghs,C1,V2 Collett, Edwards, and colleagues,C7,F1 and Bharati, Lev, and colleaguesB5 imply similar mortality to the Marcelletti report. In two reports, the median age of death was 5 weeks,C1,F1 and in another, two thirds were dead before reaching age 6 months.C7 Similar statistics are available from the review of 357 cases by Fontana and Edwards.F1 Bharati and colleagues report a

mean age of death of 6 months in 177 cases.B5 Other isolated case reportsC3,H8 confirm that some subjects, perhaps 10%, survive into adolescence or young adult life, but usually with severe pulmonary vascular disease.

Based on all these reports, about 50% of those born with this condition survive beyond the first month of life, 30% beyond 3 months, 15% beyond 6 months, and 10% beyond 1 year. There is little further mortality beyond this age until pulmonary vascular disease becomes severe and death occurs with Eisenmenger syndrome in about the third decade of life. Death in infancy is invariably due to heart failure, and when it occurs in the neonatal period, severe truncal valve regurgitation and large left-to-right shunt play contributing roles. The situation may be compounded by severe respiratory infection, as in other malformations with large left-to-right shunts in early life.

Longer-term survivors may occasionally succumb from infective endocarditis or cerebral abscess,C7 but most eventually die from consequences of severe pulmonary vascular disease (see "Pulmonary Vascular Disease" under Natural History in Section I of Chapter 35). When pulmonary vascular disease develops during the first year of life or later (and it typically develops more rapidly than in patients with isolated VSDM3), the patient has a good chance of surviving at least into the teens, as is usually the case with Eisenmenger syndrome. Thus 7 of 10 Mayo Clinic patients with pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 8 units · m2 at diagnosis before 1 year of age were alive (without treatment) 1 to 15 years (average 8.3 years) later.M3

Rather remarkably, a few patients survive infancy and early childhood without developing severe pulmonary vascular disease despite large left-to-right shunts.J2 These patients probably represent less than half of those surviving beyond 1 year of age and less than 5% of all those born with truncus arteriosus.

Survival is adversely affected by severe truncal valve regurgitation,E1 as noted earlier, or by truncal valve stenosis.G1 Even in older patients, truncal valve regurgitation is present in 60% to 70% of cases.H3 Regurgitation may be predominantly into the right ventricle. Survival is also adversely affected by coexisting interrupted aortic arch or coarctation.V2 Survival is also less favorable when there are other associated severe lesions such as left ventricular hypoplasia and a small or atretic mitral valve, complete atrioventricular septal defect, or serious extracardiac anomalies.

Survival is favorably affected by pulmonary stenosis (narrowing at the origins of the pulmonary trunk or right or left pulmonary arteries). Four of the first 28 (14%) truncus patients repaired beyond infancy at the Mayo Clinic had naturally occurring pulmonary artery stenosis.M6

# TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

Repair by whatever technique chosen is usually performed during mildly to moderately hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) using a distally placed aortic cannula, one right atrial or two vena caval cannulae, and a left-sided vent placed through the right upper pulmonary vein. Although there is no technical reason to use deep hypothermia with either lowflow CPB or circulatory arrest, some surgeons prefer it. The branch pulmonary arteries are exposed and temporarily occluded with either nontraumatic microvascular clips or snares immediately after CPB is established.

Ideally, myocardial management is accomplished with cold blood cardioplegia using antegrade cardioplegia infused directly into the truncal root (also while the branch pulmonary arteries are occluded). When moderate or severe truncal regurgitation is present, the patient is cooled on CPB to the target temperature (or until ventricular fibrillation occurs spontaneously), the truncal root is clamped and opened, and cardioplegia is delivered directly into the coronary ostia (see "Methods of Myocardial Management during Cardiac Surgery" in Chapter 3). However, surgeon preference and morphologic findings may dictate other combinations.

# Repair with Allograft Aortic or Pulmonary Valved Conduit

Following primary median sternotomy, a piece of pericardium may be taken and laid aside in a moist sponge. The proper-sized allograft aortic or pulmonary valved conduit (10-12 mm for a neonate, 12-14 mm for an infant) is selected, and its processing for insertion is begun (see Appendix 12A in Chapter 12 and Technique of Repair in Section II of Chapter 38).

Left and right pulmonary arteries are dissected in preparation for immediate temporary occlusion at the institution of CPB, as described earlier. The usual purse-string sutures are placed (see "Preparation for Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2), positioning the one for aortic cannulation as far downstream as possible so that the aortic clamp (placed proximal, or upstream, to the cannula) will be as far distal as possible on the ascending aorta.

Once CPB has been established and the pulmonary arteries controlled, cooling to the target core temperature is accomplished. The aorta is clamped and cardioplegia delivered. Snares on the pulmonary arteries are released, and repair is begun. The pulmonary trunk origin is detached from the truncal artery (Fig. 43-13, *A-B*); in truncus type II, an appropriate ellipse of truncal wall is included in the excision. The incision for detachment is begun on the left side, typically only several millimeters distal to the sinutubular junction of the truncal valve. The incision is initially made only large enough so that the interior of the truncal artery and valve, ostia of the coronary arteries, and orifices of right and left pulmonary arteries can be directly visualized. High origin of the left coronary artery should be distinguished from a pulmonary artery orifice. Detachment is then completed while viewing all these structures from within. The resulting orifice in the truncal root is closed with two rows of continuous 4-0 or 5-0 polypropylene sutures, using the second row to bring adventitia over the first row. This is done carefully to avoid distorting the coronary arteries or the truncal valve; a patch is often used for closure if direct repair risks distortion.

Alternatively, in some cases of truncus type I, the main pulmonary trunk may have enough length before it bifurcates into the two pulmonary branches such that it can be controlled directly rather than controlling the two branch pulmonary arteries individually. When this is possible, a vascular clamp can be placed across the base of the pulmonary trunk flush against the truncal root immediately upon the institution of CPB. When this is possible, the pulmonary trunk can then be separated from the truncal root, and the truncal root sutured at the clamp while the core cooling is taking

**Figure 43-13** Repair of truncus arteriosus I, II with allograft valve cylinder. **A,** After establishing cardiopulmonary bypass and clamping the aorta, pulmonary arteries are temporarily occluded while cardioplegic solution is infused, and incision for separation of pulmonary trunk from truncus artery is begun. After looking through the incision and determining the precise origin of coronary and pulmonary arteries, excision of pulmonary trunk is completed. Dashed line represents proposed vertical right ventriculotomy. **B,** Pulmonary trunk has been cut away from truncal artery, and suture line in the latter is near completion. Distal end of pulmonary trunk is prepared for conduit. Longitudinal ventriculotomy has been made. Ventricular septal defect (VSD) illustrated is typical, with a band of muscle (see Fig. 43-1) separating it from tricuspid anulus. **C,** VSD is closed by suturing patch to edges of VSD, the atrioventricular node and bundle of His being away from this edge.

place prior to aortic clamping and cardioplegia. Thus, the subsequent period of aortic clamping can be substantially shortened.

When the pulmonary trunk or separately arising (but closely related) left and right pulmonary arteries arise from the posterior aspect of the truncal artery, they are excised as part of a large button of truncal wall. The opening into the truncus is closed with a patch. The distal end of the allograft valve cylinder is then anastomosed to the large button. Similarly, when widely separated right and left pulmonary arteries come off the lateral truncal walls at the same level above the truncal valve, they are excised along with a strip of posterior truncal wall or with the entire circumference of that part of the truncal artery. Excised origins of the pulmonary arteries and adjacent aortic wall are converted into a tube, to which the distal end of the allograft valve cylinder is anastomosed.G6,S11 The transected truncal root is reconstituted by end-to-end anastomosis. Complete mobilization of the distal portion of the ascending aorta, arch, and brachiocephalic arteries should nearly always

**D,** Allograft valved conduit has been anastomosed distally to pulmonary trunk. Posterior half of proximal anastomosis has been made. A small pericardial, polytetrafluroethylene, or polyester patch is trimmed and sutured into place to fill defect between allograft and right ventricular wall. Note that posterior proximal suture line incorporates upper portion of VSD patch suture line for additional purchase. **E,** Repair is completed using a triangular hood of pericardium or synthetic material. **Figure 43-13, cont'd**

allow direct anastomosis.L1 The alternative of interposing a short segment of polyester graft is undesirable.G6

When widely spaced left and right pulmonary arteries arise from the lateral truncal wall at different levels above the truncal valve, pulmonary arteries are removed separately from the truncal root, each with a segment of surrounding truncal tissue. The branch pulmonary arteries are sewn together behind the truncal root to create continuity, using the extra truncal tissue to create a short tunnel that will be used to accept the distal aspect of the right ventricle to pulmonary conduit. The two separate defects in the truncal root are repaired with patches. A longitudinal right ventriculotomy is made just proximal to the truncal valve, essentially parallel to and to the right of the left anterior coronary artery; stay sutures may be placed for exposure. Alternatively, the opening may be enlarged to an oval shape by excising muscle from the anterior wall, leaving adequate tissue along the right and left sides so that neither the left anterior descending nor right coronary arteries will be compromised during subsequent suturing.

The VSD is repaired through the right ventriculotomy as described for tetralogy of Fallot (see "Repair of Uncomplicated Tetralogy of Fallot with Pulmonary Stenosis via Right Ventricle" under Technique of Operation in Section I of Chapter 38). However, in most cases of truncus arteriosus, there is a rim of muscle between the VSD and tricuspid anulus (ventriculoinfundibular fold; see Morphology earlier); this facilitates repair of the VSD, because sutures may be placed in this muscular rim posteroinferiorly without producing heart block or tethering the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve (Fig. 43-13, *C*). If the VSD extends far posteriorly and is juxtatricuspid as well as juxtatruncal, the appropriate suture technique must be used (away from the rim of the VSD) (see Technique of Operation in Section I of Chapters 35 and 38).B4 As in repair of tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia (see Section II of Chapter 38), the superior sutures may pass into the anterior right ventricular wall where it forms the distal margin of the circular VSD opening. If the lower margin of the VSD lies so close to the truncal valve that the left ventricular outflow tract would be narrowed following patch closure, the VSD is enlarged by excising a wedge of muscle from its anteroinferior margin. The defect is then closed with a polyester, PTFE, or pericardial patch in a manner similar to that used in repair of double-outlet right ventricle (see Fig. 53-13 in Chapter 53).

While the heart is still under cardioplegic arrest, the atrial septum is addressed if necessary. In most circumstances when a valved right ventricular outflow tract conduit is used, both secundum atrial septal defects and patent foramen ovales should be closed. If two caval cannulae are used for CPB, the cavae are snared at this point. If a single right atrial cannula is used, it is positioned into the inferior vena cava at this point. A right atriotomy is made. In the case of a single right atrial cannula, a cardiotomy suction device is positioned into the superior vena cava orifice. The atrial defect is then closed either primarily or with an autologous pericardial patch, as appropriate, using a continuous 5-0 or 6-0 polypropylene suture. The atriotomy incision is then closed.

Before placing the right ventricular outflow tract conduit, the aortic clamp is removed and core rewarming started. The allograft valve cylinder is then trimmed to an appropriate length. A conduit that is too long tends to kink the pulmonary trunk bifurcation or the back wall of the conduit itself. Either an aortic or pulmonary allograft valved conduit can be used; however, pulmonary is preferred in those requiring augmentation of the native pulmonary trunk bifurcation or stenotic pulmonary artery orifice.H5

If there is narrowing at the origins of the right or left pulmonary artery, the offending artery is opened longitudinally across the stenosis, and a tongue of allograft is left on the distal end of the conduit, widening this point. The distal conduit–to–pulmonary artery end-to-end anastomosis is constructed with continuous 6-0 or 7-0 polypropylene. The proximal end of the conduit may be anastomosed directly to the right ventriculotomy (Fig. 43-13, *D*). The posterior portion of the conduit suture line may also pick up adjacent edges of the VSD patch and right ventricular wall. A hood of pericardial or allograft arterial wall patch is usually needed to complete the anterior portion of the proximal attachment of the allograft to the ventriculotomy (Fig. 43-13, *E*). To avoid conduit valve compression or distortion and valvar regurgitation, the valve should be placed distal to its usual anatomic position, away from the back of the closed sternum. As this anastomosis is being made, rewarming is accomplished, and the remainder of the operation is completed in the usual manner (see "Completing Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2).

In neonates with typical preoperative physiology and in whom a post-CPB transesophageal echocardiogram shows normal left ventricular and right ventricular function, a right atrial volume and pressure monitoring polyvinyl catheter should be placed if one has not been placed preoperatively by the anesthesiology team. Pulmonary artery and left atrial catheters are not needed.

In older patients in whom pulmonary hypertensive episodes can be expected with a high likelihood, in patients with atypical preoperative physiology, and in those with reduced ventricular function by echocardiography post-CPB, a very important step is placing fine polyvinyl catheters in the left atrium, right atrium, and pulmonary artery by way of the right ventricle so that postoperative care may be rational, with particular regard for paroxysmal pulmonary hypertensive crisis. As for other repairs using right ventricular–to–pulmonary artery conduits, conduit reoperation may be expected in the future. Therefore, some form of pericardial closure should be considered, usually using PTFE pericardial membrane to protect the anteriorly placed conduit from injury during resternotomy.

# Repair of Truncus I, II with Autologous Tissue for Right Ventricular Outflow Tract

Preliminary steps in the operation are the same as those already described, and mildly or moderately hypothermic CPB is established in a similar fashion. The snares previously placed around left and right pulmonary arteries are snugged down, cooling of the patient is begun, the aorta is clamped and cold cardioplegia given, the left side of the heart is vented via the right upper pulmonary vein, and the snares are removed.

A longitudinal incision is made into the anterosuperior aspect of the left pulmonary artery and extended inferiorly into the truncal root toward the left sinus of Valsalva (Fig. 43-14, *A*). The interior of the truncal root is inspected through the incision, and orifices of left and right pulmonary arteries, coronary ostia (particularly that of the left coronary artery), and truncal valve cusps are identified. A woven polyester, PTFE, or pericardial patch (with or without immersion in glutaraldehyde) is then sewn into place to partition the truncal root into aortic and pulmonary trunks (Fig. 43-14, *B*).

A vertical incision is made into the right ventricle, extending it nearly to the truncal wall over the left-sided sinus of Valsalva. The VSD is repaired. The posterior wall of the right ventricular–pulmonary trunk pathway is created by suturing the inferior flap of the initial left pulmonary artery/ truncal root incision to the superior aspect of the right ventricular borders of the ventriculotomy (Fig. 43-14, *C*). The anterior wall is created by suturing into place a patch of autologous or bovine pericardium or synthetic material (Fig. 43-14, *D*). Barbero-Marcial, the innovator of this method, uses a bovine pericardial patch, to the undersurface of which has been attached a bovine pericardial monocuspid valve.B1 The remainder of operation is completed in the usual manner.

When the pulmonary trunk or separate but closely related left and right pulmonary arteries arise from the posterior aspect of the truncal artery, excision is as described in the previous section. A modification of the technique may then be necessary because of the distance between the opening into the pulmonary arteries and right ventriculotomy.B1 In this modification, the left atrial appendage is interposed to create the posterior wall of the right ventricular–pulmonary arterial pathway (Fig. 43-15).

## Repair of Truncus with Single Branch Pulmonary Artery Arising from Truncal Root

Morphology of this lesion is highly variable, and experience with each type is limited.M8 If the lung that does not have an arterial connection to the truncal root is supplied by a true branch pulmonary artery connected to a ductus arteriosus, single-stage neonatal repair is recommended. The technique of creating pulmonary artery continuity is similar to that described previously for widely separated branch pulmonary arteries that arise at different levels above the truncal valve. Care must be taken to eliminate the ductal tissue from the anastomosis.

If the lung that does not have an arterial connection to the truncal root is supplied by aortopulmonary collaterals, several options are available. If the collaterals are few and

**Figure 43-14** Repair of truncus arteriosus I, II with autologous tissue (Barbero-Marcial and colleaguesB1). **A,** Incision is made into pulmonary trunk and adjacent portion of truncal artery. Proposed right ventriculotomy *(dashed line)* begins just beneath left side of sinuses of Valsalva and extends downward and slightly leftward, avoiding (inasmuch as possible) large diagonal branches of right coronary artery. Usually the incision opens widely after stay sutures are placed, but if it does not, some free right ventricular wall may be excised. **B,** Patch is placed to separate completely neoaorta from neopulmonary trunk. Illustration shows that the patch is placed clearly on the pulmonary trunk side of cusps of neoaortic valve and coronary ostia (i.e., anteriorly). After separating neopulmonary artery from truncus (now neoaorta) the ventricular septal defect (VSD) is closed with a patch. **C,** Inferior aspect of original "truncal" incision is attached to upper portion of right ventriculotomy using fine polypropylene suture. **D,** A roof is placed on the opening with essentially the same technique and materials used for inserting a transanular patch in repair of tetralogy of Fallot (see "Decision and Technique for Transanular Patching" under Technique of Operation in Section I of Chapter 38). NOTE: Barbero-Marcial places a monocusp valve in the outflow patch that closes against the posterior suture line between pulmonary trunk and right ventricle.

large, unifocalization and complete repair in one stage is preferred. The technique of unifocalization is similar to that described for single-stage unifocalization using a median sternotomy (see Chapter 38). The unifocalized lung arterial supply is then made continuous with the "normal" pulmonary artery from the opposite lung, and intracardiac repair is accomplished. If the collaterals are multiple and complex, an initial thoracotomy is performed to unifocalize the arterial supply and create a vascular hilar confluence in the affected lung. The unifocalized vessel is then connected to a systemicto–pulmonary artery shunt.

At a second-stage procedure through a median sternotomy—which can be performed days to weeks later vascular continuity of the two lungs is created and intracardiac repair performed. After taking down the previously created shunt and removing the pulmonary artery from the truncal root, the right and left pulmonary arteries are made confluent with each other behind the truncal artery, either by direct anastomosis or with interposition of an autologous pericardial tube. After the VSD has been repaired, a valved conduit is interposed between the confluent pulmonary and right ventriculotomy.

Pulmonary arteries have previously been disconnected from aorta in some manner, often with end-to-end anastomosis for reconstruction of pulmonary arteries. **B,** Completed pathway, using a pericardial or synthetic patch for roof.

### Repair of Truncus Arteriosus with Interrupted Arch

One-stage repair from the anterior approach is the preferred procedure.D3,D7,F3,G5,S1,S2,S3 We recommend using extracorporeal circulatory management without circulatory arrest. After standard exposure through a median sternotomy, the thymus gland is subtotally resected and the pericardium opened. The great vessels are dissected above the brachiocephalic vein into the base of the neck, providing full exposure of the brachiocephalic artery. A purse-string suture is placed in the midportion of the brachiocephalic artery in preparation for arterial cannulation (Fig. 43-16, *A-B*). Purse-string sutures are placed in the superior and inferior venae cavae for venous cannulation and in the right upper pulmonary vein in preparation for left-sided venting. Depending on patient size, either a 6F or 8F arterial cannula is used to perfuse the systemic circulation through the brachiocephalic artery. Bicaval cannulation with appropriately sized right-angled venous cannulae is also performed.

Once CPB is initiated, the two branch pulmonary arteries are temporarily occluded with either snares or vascular clamps, allowing perfusion of the lower body through the ductus arteriosus. After a core body temperature of 25°C is achieved, the ductus arteriosus is ligated and divided just distal to the left branch pulmonary artery origin, and perfusion flow is reduced to 30 to 40 mL · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , effectively establishing antegrade selective cerebral perfusion. The aorta is clamped and cardioplegia introduced into the aortic root. Caval snares are tightened to provide occlusive venous return, and a vent is placed through the right upper pulmonary vein purse string, across the mitral valve, and into the left ventricle.

The distal ductus arteriosus and proximal descending aorta are dissected to the second set of intercostal vessels, and a curved vascular clamp is placed on the descending aorta to prevent backbleeding. All ductal tissue is resected from the descending aorta. The aortic clamp is then adjusted by moving it superiorly to allow arterial perfusion to the brachiocephalic and left carotid arteries while leaving the ascending aorta available for aortic arch reconstruction. This is achieved by placing the aortic clamp in a slightly oblique position as shown in Fig. 43-16, *C*.

Arch reconstruction as shown in Fig. 43-16, *C* and *D* is performed, using the left subclavian artery to establish arch continuity. The pulmonary trunk confluence is removed from the side of the common trunk in standard fashion. The ascending aorta is then incised from the opening in the truncal root that resulted from removing the pulmonary arteries, up to the arch. The ascending aorta, arch, and proximal descending aorta are augmented with a patch similar in length and shape to the patch used in stage-one reconstruction for patients with hypoplastic left heart physiology (see Chapter 49).

Alternatively, a direct descending-to-ascending aortic anastomosis can be performed. In this case, an appropriately sized incision is made in the left posterolateral aspect of the ascending aorta to accommodate the diameter of the descending aorta. A primary end-to-side anastomosis of the descending aorta to the ascending aorta is done (Fig. 43-16, *F*) using a nonabsorbable monofilament suture.

Once the arch repair is completed, the aortic clamp is repositioned at the mid–ascending aorta, reestablishing total body perfusion, and perfusion flow rate is increased appropriately. Additional doses of cardioplegia are given through the aortic root as appropriate every 20 to 25 minutes.

The cardiac portion of the repair is performed in standard fashion through a right ventricular infundibular incision, with patch closure of the VSD, assessment of the atrial septum with maintenance of a competent foramen ovale, and placement of a right ventricle–to–pulmonary trunk valved allograft conduit (Fig. 43-16, *E*). Rewarming and separation from CPB are performed in standard fashion (see "Completing Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2).

An alternative approach is to use hypothermic circulatory arrest. The aortic cannula is placed distally into the ascending aorta, and a single venous cannula is placed into the right atrium at its junction with the inferior vena cava. Two periods of hypothermic circulatory arrest are used: to reconstruct the aortic arch and again to close the VSD (although the second period of arrest is not uniformly necessary).

Using either technique just described, it is imperative to achieve adequate resection of ductal tissue so that later anastomotic stenosis in the arch does not occur. When primary descending-to-ascending aortic anastomosis is used, the connection is made as distally on the arch as possible to prevent compression of the left bronchus.

Pulmonary artery branches are temporarily occluded while delivering cold cardioplegia. **C,** Diminutive aortic arch and descending aorta are thoroughly mobilized and all ductal tissue resected (see Technique of Operation in Section II of Chapter 48). Transection of left subclavian artery enhances mobilizing the ascending aorta, which has been opened in preparation for augmentation.

**D,** Descending aorta has been attached to ascending aorta and neoaorta augmented by the allograft gusset. **E,** Operation is completed as usual for truncus arteriosus by closing ventricular septal defect through a right ventriculotomy and connecting the isolated pulmonary trunk to the right ventricle using a valved allograft conduit. **F,** Alternative traditional repair. Ascending and descending aortae are fully mobilized. All ductal tissue is resected. Pulmonary trunk is isolated from truncus arteriosus and the latter closed with a small patch. Descending aorta is anastomosed directly to low ascending aorta. After closure of ventricular septal defect, right ventricle is connected to pulmonary trunk with a valved conduit. **Figure 43-16, cont'd**

If bronchial compression is still of concern, alternative arch reconstructive techniques, such as that shown in Fig. 43-16, *A* to *E* or the technique described by McKay and colleagues, <sup>M7</sup> can be used. The McKay technique involves placing the distal aortic segment beneath (posterior to) the pulmonary arteries and anastomosing it to the defect left in the truncal artery by excision of the pulmonary trunk. <sup>M7</sup> The ascending aortic valved allograft from the right ventricle to pulmonary trunk is placed anterior to the reconstructed aortic pathway.

Other techniques are described for bringing the pulmonary arteries anterior to the aorta. P2 It has also been reported that success has been achieved by leaving the ductus arteriosus open to serve as a permanent pathway to the descending aorta and performing the usual operation for truncus arteriosus. D3,G5,M2 However, in most patients who are under consideration for surgery in the neonatal period, the ductus is not a reliable long-term pathway, because it will narrow and close.

#### SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Neonates and infants who have undergone repair of truncus arteriosus require the same standard intensive care required for all patients undergoing complex cardiac repair. If repair is undertaken after 12 weeks of age, a right ventricular or pulmonary artery pressure catheter is required because these patients are particularly susceptible to pulmonary hypertensive crises, the prevention and management of which are described under "General Care of Neonates and Infants" in Section IV of Chapter 5.

#### **RESULTS**

#### Survival

# Early (Hospital) Death

Non-risk-adjusted hospital mortality of 17% (CL 12%-24%) was reported by Hanley and colleagues<sup>H4</sup> in 63 neonates and infants operated on between 1986 and 1991. Patients included those with interrupted aortic arch, severe coronary anomalies, and severe truncal valve regurgitation. In patients without these risk factors, there was no early mortality. Similarly, hospital mortality of 11% (CL 7%-17%) was reported in 46 neonates and infants operated on during the same period by Bove and colleagues.<sup>B7</sup> Kalavrouziotis and colleagues<sup>K1</sup> reported a 3.4% early mortality in 29 patients operated on between 1993 and 2005, and Thompson and colleagues<sup>T4</sup> reported a 5% mortality in 65 consecutive neonates operated on between 1992 and 1999. These studies are representative of what can be accomplished in the current era in institutions properly experienced to perform this type of surgery in neonates and young infants.

With the exception of the 1984 study by Ebert and colleagues<sup>E2</sup> that reported a mortality of 11%, most earlier studies reported much higher early mortality. D7,M11 No deaths (0%; CL 0%-24%) were reported by Sano and colleagues among 7 neonates and infants undergoing repair of truncus arteriosus and interrupted aortic arch, and Tlaskal and colleagues reported 1 death (12%) in 8 patients. In marked contrast to these single-institution studies, the multiinstitutional Congenital Heart Surgeons Society report of 50 patients with truncus arteriosus with interrupted aortic arch operated on from 1987 to 1997 showed an early mortality of about 50%.

The single-institution reports by Miyamoto and colleagues<sup>M10</sup> and Sinzobahamvya and colleagues<sup>S8</sup> also showed an early mortality of about 50% in patients undergoing operation from 1987 to 2007.

#### Time-Related Survival

For patients undergoing repair of truncus arteriosus during the first year of life, 10-year and 20-year survival is about the same as operative (30-day) and hospital survival, because few patients die after hospital discharge. <sup>B9,B10,D7,M14,P1,R1,W3</sup> A representative report is that by Rajasinghe and colleagues (Fig. 43-17). Among 165 patients surviving initial repair, there were 23 late deaths (median follow-up 10.5 years), 10 related to reoperation. <sup>R1</sup>

#### Modes of Death

Most deaths occur early after operation, and the mode is usually acute cardiac failure.

# Incremental Risk Factors for Premature Death after Repair

Hanley and colleagues<sup>H4</sup> performed a multivariable analysis of 63 patients; interrupted aortic arch, severe truncal valve regurgitation, severe coronary artery abnormalities, and age older than 100 days at operation were identified as risk factors for early death. The multivariable analysis by Brown and colleagues<sup>B10</sup> indicated that earlier year of operation and coexisting interrupted aortic arch were risk factors. More recent studies, not surprisingly, suggest that morphologic factors such as interrupted aortic arch and truncal valve regurgitation may no longer be risks. J1,T4 Thompson and colleagues, T4 however, show that some of these previously identified risk factors continue to be of clinical concern but fall just short of reaching statistical significance as risk factors (Table 43-5). Other variables have not been clearly identified as risk factors, but they have not been rigorously studied. They are discussed briefly in the text that follows.

From Thompson and colleagues.T4

# *Age at Repair*

Young age has been neutralized in institutions properly prepared for neonatal cardiac surgery, where risk after neonatal repair has been reduced to about 10%.B7,H4 In fact, many recent series involve only neonates.T4 Older age at may be a risk factor for premature death after repair, both early and late. However, age is probably a surrogate for severity of pulmonary vascular diseaseH4 (see later).

#### *Low Birth Weight*

Low birth weight has been identified as a risk factor for early death in two single-institution studies, one of 65 consecutive neonatal repairs and the other of 61 patients younger than 6 months of age at repair.D1,T4

#### *Type of Truncus Arteriosus*

Types I and II truncus arteriosus are so similar that no difference in risk of death after operation has been identified.T6 Relatively few patients with truncus arteriosus type III have undergone repair, but increased complexity of operation is expected to increase risk of death to some extent.

#### *Size of Ventricular Septal Defect*

Closure of relatively small VSDs may result in some degree of left ventricular outflow obstruction; surgical enlargement of such defects risks interference with septal coronary arteries. Thus, small size of the VSD may be a risk factor.

# *Predominance of Origin of the Truncal Artery*

The more the truncal artery lies over the right ventricle, the greater the probability that VSD closure will narrow the left ventricular outflow tract (particularly when the VSD is small and has not been surgically enlarged), potentially increasing the risk of death early after operation. Possibly this risk factor and that of small VSD size can be neutralized by appropriate VSD enlargement and proper contouring of the VSD patch.

#### *Small Size of Right and Left Pulmonary Arteries*

Small branch pulmonary arteries may present risk, especially if proximal obstruction is not addressed at surgical reconstruction.

# *Truncal Valve Abnormalities*

Narrowing of the truncal valve may be difficult to identify and evaluate because flow through it, comprising both systemic and pulmonary flow, is large. Preoperative evaluation typically indicates obstruction across the truncal valve because of the high flow; however, true stenosis is rare and has not been specifically identified as a risk factor. Severe truncal valve regurgitation itself is a well-identified risk factor for death after repair.E2,H4 This is probably related to both its unfavorable effect postoperatively and its interference with myocardial management intraoperatively.D5 Treatment of truncal valve regurgitation, either by valvuloplasty or by using an allograft valve conduit placed by the "mini" rootreplacement technique (see "Allograft Aortic Valve Cylinder" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 12) is the most important modification of the operation for neutralizing incremental risk of truncal regurgitation (see Appendix 6C in Chapter 6).B7

# *Truncus with Only One Branch Pulmonary Artery Connected to the Truncal Root*

Neonates and infants undergoing repair of truncus with only one branch pulmonary artery connected to the truncal root undergo a complex single- or two-stage operation, increasing risk. Nonetheless, repair has been accomplished in 10 infants by Mee, with a 20% (CL 7%-41%) hospital mortality and no post-discharge deaths in a follow-up of nearly 5 years.M8

In patients who do not undergo repair during the first 6 months of life, pulmonary vascular disease develops rapidly in the lung supplied from the truncus arteriosus, increasing both early and late risks of repair.M1

# *Major Associated Cardiac Anomalies*

Major associated cardiac anomalies increase overall risks. Repair of truncus arteriosus and interrupted arch has been associated with risk of early death in up to 50% of patients,B10,H4 but more recent studies bring this association into question.J1

## *Pulmonary Vascular Disease*

Irreversible pulmonary vascular disease is rarely an issue when repair is performed during the first 3 months of life. The likelihood of postoperative pulmonary hypertensive episodes, however, increases in infants who are repaired after the first 3 weeks of age.H4 These episodes are a manifestation of a damaged pulmonary vasculature, but the vasculature can remodel and become normal when hemodynamics are normalized with early repair. Progressive damage to the pulmonary vasculature may play an important role in the increased risk of death observed in patients operated on later than 3 months of age.H4

*a* Numbers in parentheses are 95% confidence intervals.

An odds ratio >1 indicates shorter freedom from reintervention.

Repair of interrupted aortic arch is not listed, because all patients with an interrupted arch underwent concurrent repair, and the odds ratio and *P* value were identical.

# Progressing Truncal Valve Regurgitation

31 26

Rajasinghe and colleagues show that pre-repair truncal valve regurgitation portends only a 20% freedom from eventual truncal valve replacement, and also that a few valves with no pre-repair truncal regurgitation will have to be replaced (Fig. 43-18). Henaine and colleagues showed the same associations. Ho Most patients have mild regurgitation 1 to 2 years after repair, and occasionally moderate regurgitation is observed at that time. Mortality for truncal valve replacement can be high when performed in children early after initial truncus repair, but mortality for late truncal valve replacement is low. M4

## Conduit Replacement

51

34

Conduit replacement or revision is almost inevitable (Fig. 43-19). Mean time to conduit replacement was 5.5 years in the study by Rajasinghe and colleagues. R1 The only factor associated with shorter time to replacement is smaller conduit size at initial repair. R1 Type of conduit (aortic allograft, pulmonary allograft, or xenograft) does not seem to affect the interval between initial repair and need for reoperation. C5,R1 Avoidance of a conduit and use of the direct right ventricleto-pulmonary artery connection at the initial operation may reduce the need for reoperation on the right ventricular outflow tract, D1 but the need for catheter-based intervention for obstruction is higher using the direct connection. Thus, the requirement for intervention of any kind (surgical and catheter-based combined) is the same for both conduit and direct connection techniques.<sup>C5</sup> In the series by Honjo and colleagues, freedom from intervention for right ventricular outflow tract obstruction was only 50% at 5 years.  $^{\rm H10}$  The jugular venous valved conduit has been evaluated in a prospective multicentered study and appears to be equivalent to allograft conduits in most respects. Ho Time to conduit replacement was similar, and both right ventricular outflow tract gradient and valve regurgitation showed similar progression in the two conduit types.

catheter intervention for stenosis was significantly slower in the jugular vein conduit.

#### **INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION**

Diagnosis of truncus arteriosus is an indication for repair. Because about 50% of surgically untreated patients die during the first month of life, repair should be recommended as early as possible, rather than deferring it to some predetermined age. A7,B6,B7,S12 This is true whether or not important cardiac anomalies coexist. In children older than 6 months at presentation, operation may be complicated, or even contraindicated, by presence of important elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance. Cardiac catheterization with assessment of pulmonary vascular resistance will determine operability. Criteria for inoperability are the same as for patients with VSD (see Indications for Operation in Section I of Chapter 35).

#### SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

## Importance of a Valve in Repair

An unsettled matter is the importance of a right ventricular outflow valve. Several groups have reported success with use of valveless conduits. B3,S7,S10 Although there are no randomized trials comparing the valveless direct connection technique and the valved conduit technique, two studies that use both techniques retrospectively evaluated outcomes. C5,D1 Fewer total reinterventions were needed in the direct connection patients in one study<sup>D1</sup> but not in the other.<sup>C5</sup> Early mortality did not differ in one study. C5 In the other, D1 it was significantly higher in the direct connection group (22% vs. 8%) by univariable analysis; however, multivariable analysis did not confirm the univariable finding. The study authors believe that the validity of the multivariable analysis may be questionable because of the small number of patients and events. To further confuse matters, biases may exist in these retrospective studies that make inferences difficult. For example, in the study by Danton and colleagues, D1 neonates

and young infants (patients not likely to have pulmonary hypertension) predominantly received the valveless direct connection, and older patients (with higher risk for pulmonary hypertension) received valved conduits. These biases may affect timing and prevalence of right ventricular outflow tract reintervention and mortality.
