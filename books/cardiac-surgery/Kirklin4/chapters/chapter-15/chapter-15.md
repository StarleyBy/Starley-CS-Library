# DEFINITION

Infective endocarditis includes conditions in which structures of the heart, most frequently the valves, harbor an infective process that leads to valvar dysfunction, localized or generalized sepsis, or sites for embolism (Box 15-1). The term *infective endocarditis* (IE) includes acute, subacute, and chronic processes; infection of bacterial, viral, rickettsial, or fungal etiology; and involvement of either native or prosthetic valves. As such, the term has no implication as to duration of the processes, infecting agent, or site of infection and thus supplants previously used terms such as "subacute bacterial endocarditis."

# HISTORICAL NOTE

In 1806, Corvisart described mitral valve vegetations found at autopsy in a 39-year-old man.C3 In their 1824 book on heart disease, Bertin and Bouillaud discuss induration and vegetations on the valves of patients dying with endocarditis.B11 The term *endocarditis* was introduced by Bouillard in 1841 when he described clinical and pathologic features of the disease.B15 Earlier, Morgagni, Lancisi, and Sandifort had described hearts with probable endocardial vegetations.L2,M15,S3

Weinstein and Brusch reported that in 1886, Wyssokowitch and Orth designed an experimental model for endocarditis in which aortic valve cusps of animals were traumatized and the animals subsequently injected with bacterial suspensions from patients with endocarditis.O3,W3,W5 The animals developed murmurs, embolic complications, and valve lesions at autopsy.

At the 1885 Gulstonian Lecture, Osler described the classic features of endocarditis.O4 By 1909, he had refined his understanding of the pathologic anatomy ("proliferative vegetations") and introduced the clinical finding of changing murmurs.O5 Along with Horder, Osler emphasized the role of blood cultures for diagnosis.H12,O4,O5

Successful treatment of endocarditis lagged behind pathologic and clinical descriptions. In the 1940s, the era of sulfa drugs, cure was achieved in about 5% of patients.W3 By 1950, however, principles of antibiotic therapy had been established, including high-dose penicillin, long duration of treatment, and antibiotic suppression.C2,G1,L4 It was also recognized at that time that delay in treatment, heart failure, advanced age, and preexisting rheumatic valvulitis were adverse prognostic factors.C2 In 1940, Tauroff and Vessell successfully ligated a patent ductus arteriosus in treating a 2-year-old female with endocarditis.T1 In 1957, Bahnson and colleagues reported occurrence of staphylococcal infection on silk sutures used for great vessel and intracardiac repairs.B2

Direct surgical treatment of IE began in 1961, when Kay and colleagues reported successful treatment of *Candida* endocarditis of the tricuspid valve. The native valve was débrided and an accompanying ventricular septal defect (VSD) closed.K3 The first report of replacing a cardiac valve for native IE was published in 1965 by Wallace and colleagues.W1 Their patient was a 45-year-old man who had severe aortic regurgitation with heavy *Klebsiella* vegetations on each cusp. He was treated intensively with antibiotics over 3 weeks, but there was resistant active infection and heart failure. Valve replacement was successful, eradicating the infection and restoring satisfactory hemodynamics.

In 1972, Merendino's group from the University of Washington reported the collective results of cardiac operations for endocarditis in 139 patients, 24 of whom were treated by mitral valve repair, mechanical prosthetic mitral replacement, and replacement of the aortic valve with

#### **Box 15-1** Definitions

*Endocarditis:* Exudative and proliferative inflammatory alterations of the endocardium, characterized by vegetations on the endocardial surface or within the endocardium. It may occur as a primary disorder (infective endocarditis) or as a complication of or in association with another disease (e.g., lupus erythematosus, rheumatic heart disease).

*Infective endocarditis:* Invasion and multiplication of microorganisms on the endocardial surface, within the endocardium, within the myocardium, or on prosthetic materials within and around cardiac structures. It includes conditions in which structures of the heart, most frequently the valves, harbor an infective process that leads to valvar dysfunction, localized or generalized sepsis, or sites for embolism. The term covers:

- Acute, subacute, and chronic processes
- Infection of bacterial, viral, rickettsial, or fungal etiology
- Involvement of either native or prosthetic valves (or other prosthetic material)

*Acute endocarditis:* A severe form of infective endocarditis caused by virulent pyogenic microorganisms such as hemolytic streptococci or staphylococci. It can become life threatening within days.

*Subacute endocarditis:* A form of infective endocarditis that develops subtly over a period of weeks to several months. It may produce symptoms for months before heart valve damage or emboli make the diagnosis clear. It is usually caused by *Streptococcus viridans* or *Streptococcus fecalis*.

*Active endocarditis:* A surgical term indicating an operation carried out in the presence of obvious local cardiac infection manifested by inflammation, active vegetations, abscesses, burrowing sinuses, or fistulae. If such an operation is carried out while a patient is being treated with antibiotics for active infection, or has been treated within 2 weeks of operation, the disease is considered active.

*Healed endocarditis:* A surgical term indicating an operation carried out in the absence of obvious local cardiac infection and inflammation, generally following treatment and supposed eradication of microorganisms. It is characterized by lack of local inflammation; vegetations may be present but are generally endothelialized, and abscesses have resulted in well-defined and stable cavities, including sinuses and fistulae.

*Native valve endocarditis:* Infectious endocarditis involving a patient's own (native) heart valve.

*Prosthetic valve endocarditis:* Infectious endocarditis involving a surgically implanted prosthetic heart valve. *Prosthetic valve endocarditis* and its abbreviation *PVE* are familiar, standard, and historical designations for infective endocarditis on any heart valve substitute, but "prosthetic" is at times a misnomer (e.g., infection of a pulmonary autograft). A more appropriate term is *replacement device endocarditis*, but in this chapter the historical term is maintained for the sake of familiarity.

β-propiolactone–sterilized allografts; 17 of 24 patients survived.M2 The report emphasized continuing sepsis and heart failure as indications for operation, compared native ("primary") to prosthetic ("secondary") valve endocarditis, and differentiated between active and healed lesions.

Most of the modern concepts of surgical treatment of IE were articulated by the late 1970s and reviewed in publications by Stinson and by Richardson and colleagues.R2,S11

# PATHOGENESIS AND MORPHOLOGY

# Pathogenesis

The most common site of cardiac involvement is on the line of closure of a valve surface, typically on the atrial side of atrioventricular valves and on the ventricular surface of semilunar valves.B3 Once bacteria become attached to the surface, the vegetation matures through bacterial proliferation and fibrin deposition. The preponderance of bacteria below the surface of the vegetation provides protection from phagocytes and high antibiotic concentration.

Several predisposing factors have been identified that may contribute to or be responsible for development of IE. Despite Osler's initial observations, valvulitis of rheumatic fever was often confused histologically with IE.O4 However, unlike rheumatic valvulitis, IE is not characterized in its early stages by global neovascularization or global inflammation of valve cusps. In most cases, the *valvar endocardial surface must be altered* to allow deposition of fibrin and platelets and subsequent attachment of bacteria. This injury may result from preexisting valvar lesions such as rheumatic valvulitis, anular or valvar calcification, or catheter trauma. Hemodynamic factors may contribute, such as the jet effect of blood flow through a patent ductus arteriosus or restrictive VSD, mitral valve prolapse, or bicuspid aortic valve. Bacteremia must occur in bacterial-based IE. Frequent transient bacteremias are found in 60% to 80% of normal individuals, but the number of organisms is small, and without the presence of one or more of the above factors, infection and vegetations do not result.W3

Several lines of evidence have demonstrated the importance of a *compromised or altered immune system* in the pathogenesis of IE. Histopathologic analysis of kidney tissue in patients with IE may reveal diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis, with evidence of deposition of immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM.B7 Circulating immune complexes (CICs) may be found in the glomerular basement membrane, retina, and peripheral lesions (Roth spots and Janeway lesions).B8,G9 Various manifestations of complement activation have been found in IE.O1 Hooper and colleagues identified CICs in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE).H11 Kauffmann and colleagues found a positive correlation between CIC levels and duration of illness,K2 and several investigators have noted a decline in CIC levels with successful treatment.B8,C1

*Staphylococcus aureus* binds to porcine valvar endothelial cells by a mechanism that is specific and receptor mediated.J2 This characteristic most likely represents a specific *physiochemical interaction* between microbial adhesins and a hostcell receptor that involves fibronectin lipoteichoic acid.G7,R1,V2 IE involving a previously normal valve is often caused by *S. aureus*.

In several studies, one quarter of IE cases occurred on normal valves.M8,W4 Likely organisms are those that have increased adhesion molecules noted on dextran polymerization, namely *Staphylococcus, Streptococcus viridans,* and *Enterococcus*. Common risk factors are presence of overwhelming sepsis, resuscitation from shock, use of long-term indwelling catheters, intravenous (IV) drug abuse, and fungemia associated with prolonged antibiotic therapy. Only about 5% of patients with catheter sepsis are found to have IE, and this is generally due to staphylococcal organisms. *Iatrogenic IE* most often occurs in patients undergoing

**Figure 15-1** Flow through a permeable tube. High-pressure source drives fluid through an orifice into a low-pressure sink. Curved arrows leaving the stream entering wall in upstream segment represent normal perfusion of lining layer. Velocity is maximal and perfusing pressure is low immediately beyond orifice, where momentum of stream converges stream lines to form a vena contracta. Low pressure in this segment results in reduced perfusion and may cause retrograde flow from deeper layers of vessel into the flowing stream. It is at the vena contracta that bacteria and other formed elements in blood accumulate. (From Rodbard.R4)

chronic hemodialysis who have frequent staphylococcal bacteremias and also may have sclerotic aortic or mitral valves.

It has long been acknowledged that usual bacterial vegetations of IE can result from seeding of a platelet-thrombin nidus after mechanical trauma. Garrison and Freedman produced endocarditis in rabbits by inserting a catheter into the endocardium and injecting bacterial isolates from humans with endocarditis.G1 This model remains the principal experimental paradigm for the mechanical basis of IE.

Perhaps the most persuasive hypothesis for the pathogenesis of IE has been put forward by Rodbard.R4 Basically, *high-velocity jets* of blood from a high-pressure source form at an orifice and enter a low-pressure sink. *Venturi currents* deposit bacteria immediately beyond the orifice to form vena contracta and result in mechanical erosion and deposition of platelets and thrombin (Fig. 15-1). These mechanical conditions exist beyond stenotic valves, on the pulmonary artery opposite a patent ductus arteriosus (Fig. 15-2), and on the left atrial aspect of a regurgitant mitral valve. Because most IE lesions of the aortic valve begin on the ventricular aspect, however, this suggests a role for valvar regurgitation in the pathogenesis of these lesions, and the Venturi effect would also apply (Table 15-1).

The abnormal endocardial and endothelial surfaces and increased turbulence imparted by numerous cardiac malformations create a substrate that is vulnerable to infection. The risk of infection associated with various cardiac abnormalities is reflected in the American Heart Association recommendations for prophylactic antibiotics in patients with such malformations.

#### Morphology

Usual sites for IE found at operation in patients with native valve endocarditis (NVE) not related to IV drug use are shown in Fig. 15-3. Vegetations and erosive cavities are on the ventricular aspect of the aortic valve cusps and at the base of the atrial aspect of the mitral valve leaflets, often resulting in separation or discontinuity at the ventriculoarterial or atrioventricular junction. Less often, discrete perforations caused by isolated vegetations are located on the aortic cusps themselves. Occasionally, "drop lesions" from the aortic valve occur on the anterior mitral leaflet or the tensor apparatus of the mitral valve.

![](_page_2_Picture_10.jpeg)

**Figure 15-2** Representation of infective endocarditis at a patent ductus arteriosus. Vegetations are deposited on pulmonary artery wall opposite a high-velocity jet through an open ductus.

In the vast majority of non–drug-related cases of NVE, valve deposits are left-sided. In IV drug–related IE, the tricuspid valve is involved in about half the cases and aortic or mitral valves in the remainder.M4 Perianular pseudoaneurysms (abscesses) are more frequently associated with aortic than with mitral vena contracta endocarditis and occur in about one third of cases studied by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE); *S. aureus* is the predominant organism.T9 Clinically, presence of pericarditis, rapid progression of symptoms, and a high degree of atrioventricular block are associated with perianular abscess.A5

In PVE, all or most vegetations are on the ventricular aspect of the prosthesis. Only a small area of sewing-ring detachment may be apparent and may appear sterile. At operation, therefore, a thorough search must be made beneath the prosthesis for the bulk of the pathologic process. As noted in some series, there may be important detachment without apparent vegetations; this may occur in either the presence or absence of positive blood cultures.I1 This represents PVE and requires replacement of the prosthesis.

#### CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

Infective endocarditis is present when defined in accordance with New York Heart Association (NYHA) criteriaN3: positive blood cultures associated with either new or changing murmurs or embolic phenomena; or new or changing murmurs in a patient with a congenital cardiac anomaly or prior valve damage, associated with either embolic phenomena or sustained fever, anemia, and splenomegaly. Most authorities accept a modification of that definition to include progressive heart failure in the presence of positive blood cultures. In an effort to improve specificity and sensitivity for the diagnosis of IE, investigators at Duke University have

proposed criteria modeled after the Jones criteria for diagnosing rheumatic feverD14 (Box 15-2). These criteria include major and minor signs and symptoms, echocardiographic findings, possible iatrogenic and nosocomial factors (e.g., indwelling catheters), and history of IV drug abuse.B9

The most common clinical manifestation of IE is *fever,* which is present in 95% to 100% of patients. This applies to both NVE and PVE. The fever may be low grade or spiking and generally follows peaks of bacteremia by about 2 hours. Patients at risk for IE who develop unexplained fever for more than 48 hours should have two or more sets of blood cultures drawn from different sites. Because of the importance of proper identification of the offending organism, administration of antibiotics should be delayed until blood cultures have been obtained.B14

Positive blood cultures are obtained in about 95% of patients even when right-sided endocarditis, endocarditis caused by fungus, endocarditis in addicts, and endocarditis caused by fastidious organisms are included.

In IE cases confirmed by echocardiography, autopsy, or operation, positive blood cultures are obtained in 95% of cases with two blood specimens and in 98% with four specimens.W4 However, occurrence of negative-culture endocarditis rises to about 10% in most surgical series,S4 and PVE predominates in this group of patients.H8

Culture-negative IE is more likely with intracellular or fastidious organisms, or with previous antibiotic therapy.H1 A history of antibiotic therapy or serologic evidence of *Mycoplasma* or *Chlamydia* species is likely responsible for negativeculture IE. Other causes include *Candida, Aspergillus,* and fastidious slow-growing organisms such as Q-fever *(Coxiella burnetii)* and *Bartonella* organisms.P3

A heart murmur is found in about 85% to 95% of IE patients. Changing murmurs occur much less frequently (≈15% to 20%). Although the concept of changing murmurs has been classically associated with IE since Osler's Gulstonian Lecture in 1885, clinically changing murmurs are not often appreciated.O4 Ten percent of IE patients lack murmurs, particularly those with tricuspid involvement. Infection involving the aortic valve and root is often characterized by a relatively short diastolic murmur. There may be a murmur only in early systole or midsystole, although murmurs are often obscured by tachycardia. The murmur of mitral regurgitation caused by IE is similar to that of other mitral regurgitation murmurs and may exhibit a typical radiation posteriorly when the anterior leaflet is perforated. There also may be signs of mitral stenosis secondary to obstruction by large vegetations, in which case the murmur may be diastolic.

Pulse pressure may be normal or even narrowed in aortic regurgitation if IE is acute or important heart failure exists. Narrowed pulse pressure is caused by high left ventricular end-diastolic pressure with low cardiac output. There is frequently a gallop rhythm.

Infection of the mitral valve and its supporting structures is considered to be less frequent than aortic valve endocarditis, but may be more indolent in its course. The mitral valve is most commonly involved (≈40% of cases), followed by the aortic valve in about 36%, when *S. aureus* is the infecting organism.M10 *Right-sided endocarditis* is almost uniquely related to the tricuspid valve. Right-sided IE accounts for about 10% of IE cases and usually occurs in the setting of IV drug abuse. Affected patients tend to be younger and have fewer comorbidities and less structural heart disease than patients with left-sided IE.M11,M16 Right-sided lesions are associated with fever, but often a cardiac murmur is initially absent.

Anemia frequently occurs in IE patients and has multifactorial causes, but primarily it results from marrow suppression secondary to chronic disease. Arthritis and arthralgias are infrequently seen today, generally because endocarditis is diagnosed earlier. Myalgias are common and may be associated with bacteremia or occasionally may result from myocardial microabscesses, generally occurring in staphylococcal bacteremia.

Severity of heart failure in a hospitalized IE patient is not appropriately classified by NYHA functional class. In general, heart failure can be termed *mild* when only small doses of diuretic or digitalis are necessary; *moderate* when large doses

of diuretic, afterload-reducing medications and bed rest are necessary; and *severe* when cardiogenic shock is present and inotropic agents are needed.

Embolization is the presenting manifestation in about 10% to 15% of patients with left-sided IE, and about half of patients with IE have evidence of embolic phenomena on physical examB3 or via diagnostic imaging. These emboli seem about evenly distributed between cerebral and peripheral sites. Classic peripheral signs of endocarditis—Osler nodes, Janeway lesions, Roth spots, petechiae, and clubbing—are late manifestations and are infrequently seen in a surgical practice. The one exception may be Janeway lesions, and when noted, the infecting organism is almost always *Staphylococcus*.

In practice, diagnosis of IE is primarily based on two tests: blood cultures and echocardiography. The diagnosis is made most often by the *presence of positive blood cultures* and a *cardiac lesion* characterized by new stenosis, new regurgitation, or echocardiographic evidence for a vegetation. There are many more individuals with sepsis and positive blood cultures but without cardiac manifestations, and they are not considered to have IE.

## **Box 15-2** Diagnostic Criteria for Infective Endocarditis

## **Major Criteria**

## *Positive Blood Culture*

Typical microorganisms for infective endocarditis (IE) from two separate blood cultures (viridans streptococci,*a Streptococcus bovis*, HACEK group, or community-acquired *Staphylococcus aureus* or enterococci) in absence of a primary focus, *or*

Persistently positive blood culture, defined as recovery of a microorganism consistent with IE from:

Blood cultures drawn more than 12 hours apart, *or* All of three or majority of four or more separate blood cultures, with first and last drawn at least 1 hour apart

Key: *HACEK, Haemophilus* spp., *Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella* spp., and *Kingella kingae; IV,* intravenous.

An excellent microbiology laboratory is essential for accurate and prompt diagnosis. With current techniques, ability to culture fastidious organisms (e.g., Q-fever *[Coxiella burnetii], Mycoplasma*) is high. Thus, diagnosis of IE involving cardiac valves or congenital malformations is made on a constellation of findings, usually fever, positive blood cultures, and hemodynamic derangement within the cardiac structures that is best assessed and followed by echocardiography.

*Echocardiography* has become a standard modality for diagnosis and continuing observation of patients with IE.M19,M20 In all situations, TEE has greater sensitivity and **Box 15-3** Echocardiographic and Clinical Features Suggesting Potential Need for Surgical Intervention in Patients with Infective Endocarditis

specificity than transthoracic echocardiography (TTE).S7 Specificity for TEE is approximately 90% and sensitivity 95%.B12,D2 For TTE, accuracy ranges from 40% to 80%. These figures apply equally to NVE and PVE. Perivalvar or perianular cavities associated with prosthetic valves are more easily delineated with TEE, and in the view of some authorities, these represent pseudoaneurysms rather than abscess cavities in most patients.T9 Box 15-3 summarizes the echocardiographic and clinical findings in IE that indicate the potential need for operation.

An algorithm for diagnosis of IE begins with fever, requires positive blood cultures, includes some sign or symptom referable to the heart, and receives anatomic corroboration with TEE. From TEE, vegetation size, mobility, and position can be documented; degree of stenosis and regurgitation associated with the valve lesion can be assessed; and in PVE the presence of prosthetic leakage or perianular cavities can be determined.

The decision to use *cardiac catheterization and angiography* has varied over the years and continues to be made on a case-by-case basis. In few cases have vegetations been disturbed by intraarterial or venous catheters, and a reasonable policy is that if coronary artery disease or coronary embolization is suspected, coronary angiography should be undertaken before operation.H5

*Neurologic abnormalities* may have occurred in as many as 25% to 30% of IE patients at initial presentation. They are protean in nature and include stroke, transient ischemic attack, toxic encephalopathy, meningitis, brain abscess, loss of vision, seizures, headache, backache, and acute mononeuropathy.J3 Funduscopic examination (Roth spots or flame hemorrhages), cerebrospinal fluid examination, and computed tomography (CT) scanning or magnetic resonance

imaging (MRI) of the brain are performed as indicated, and results may alter timing of surgical therapy (see following discussion). MRI may be particularly effective in detecting cerebral embolic lesions in IE patients without neurologic symptoms.D16

Embolic events are reported frequently in IE patients (24%-67%).G4 Prevalence is probably higher in IV drug– related endocarditis and perhaps slightly lower in PVE. The brain is the most frequently identified site of emboli.S4

The incidence of IE in the United States is reported to be 1.7D8,H7,K4,S6 to as high as 11.6B10 episodes per 100,000 persons per yearS9,T10,V5 and is highest in the oldest age group,D11,D15,H10 with variance due in great part to varying diagnostic and reporting criteria. Approximately 10,000 to 20,000 new cases of IE are diagnosed each year in the United States, accounting for about 1 in 1000 hospital admissions.F1 The IE profile has changed over the past several decades; in the current era, IE is more frequently associated with invasive medical procedures and old age and less frequently associated with rheumatic heart disease and poor dentition.H7,P4 In the elderly, it is more often linked to a prosthetic valve and bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract.D15 Terpenning and colleagues found that indwelling catheters were implicated as the source of bacteremia in half the cases of nosocomial IE.T3

Prosthetic heart valves represent a strong risk factor for IE.G6 In a large study of adult patients, occurrence of PVE was 4.1% at 48 months after valve replacement in 1465 consecutive hospital survivors, and 64% of these patients died.I1 Occurrence of PVE after valve replacement appears to be much lower in the current era, with overall risk about 1% to 5% in the first year after valve replacement and about 1% per year thereafter.M1 Other studies report an annual incidence of PVE ranging from 0.12% to 0.4% per patient-year.D7 The hazard for developing PVE is greater in patients operated on for NVE than in those undergoing valve replacement for other reasonsB13,I1 (Fig. 15-4). In addition to NVE as a risk

factor for PVE, placement of a mechanical prosthesis (vs. a tissue valve), black race, male gender, and longer cardiopulmonary bypass time are incremental risk factors for subsequent development of PVE. Finally, prosthetic valve reoperation is a greater hazard for development of PVE than primary valve replacement (Fig. 15-5).

It is difficult to identify a precise causative factor for PVE. However, intraoperative surface contamination, introduction of contaminated blood or blood substitute, bacterial colonization of a member of the surgical team, bacterial aerosolization in ventilators, nasal colonization of the patient, and preexisting urosepsis have all been implicated. In contrast to prosthetic heart valves, implanted anuloplasty rings and indwelling pacemaker leads are infrequently disposed to IE.G6,R5

Among the pediatric population, IE most often occurs in patients with VSDs and valvar aortic stenosis. Incidence is low (14.5 per 10,000 person-years) but 35 times that of the normal population.G3 Incidence of IE in patients with VSD is reduced by about 50% after surgical closure. Postoperative IE in children most often occurs after aortic valvotomy, valve replacement, or use of a right ventricular–pulmonary artery conduit.A6 In both pediatric and adult populations, mitral valve prolapse has emerged as a frequent preexisting malformation in the spectrum of IE (29% of patients in McKinsey and colleagues' seriesM8).

#### Causative Organisms

Approximately 80% of endocarditis cases are caused by streptococcal or staphylococcal species. *S. aureus* predominates as the infecting organism in the majority of hospital-acquired and drug-related cases of IE. *S. aureus* involves the mitral valve more than the aortic valve and results in higher occurrence of embolism compared with other organisms.M10 Streptococcal IE accounts for about 30% of IE cases, and viridans streptococci are the most common causative organisms. Enterococci are the third leading cause of IE, implicated in about 10% of cases.M5 Enterococcal IE typically occurs in elderly males with multiple comorbidities, results less commonly in embolic events, and disproportionately affects the aortic valve. Gram-negative bacilli account for about 5% of cases. Distribution of infecting organisms in the usual NVE population, however, may vary among institutions and temporally.  $^{A6,M10,R2,S4,W2}$ 

In PVE occurring within 2 months of operation, *Staphylococcus epidermidis* is the major offending organism. Lateonset PVE has the same general spectrum of causative organisms as NVE. Enterococcal PVE (usually caused by *Enterococcus faecalis* or *Enterococcus faecium*) is usually associated with manipulation of the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract or with malignancy.

# Complications

The most frequent cardiac complication of NVE is *heart failure*, primarily caused by valvar regurgitation. However, NVE occasionally results in mitral or tricuspid valve stenosis and infrequently in aortic valve stenosis.

Perianular leakage and abscess and occasionally stenosis are the major causes of heart failure in PVE, with perianular extension occurring in over 50% of cases. G8 It occurs in 10% to 40% of NVE cases and is more common with aortic valve involvement. G8 This dangerous complication can lead to abscess formation, pseudoaneurysms, and aortocavitary fistula formation (which can develop from any aortic sinus). A2 Myocardial abscesses (most commonly related to S. aureus infection) complicate IE in 20% to 40% of cases and are particularly common with PVE and aortic valve involvement. G8 Patients with a bicuspid aortic valve and IE carry a high risk of abscess formation. Ti2 Development of conduction abnormalities should prompt further TEE evaluation for abscess formation or extension. If left untreated, abscess cavities may progress to fistula formation and intracardiac shunting from myocardial perforation. Once these complications develop, mortality may exceed 40% despite surgical intervention.<sup>A2</sup> If the rare patient with a small abscess cavity (≤1 cm), clinically controlled infection, and multiple comorbidities is treated medically, close follow-up with serial echocardiography during prolonged antibiotic therapy is mandatory. P5 Pericarditis typically occurs in association with anular abscess or myocardial perforation.

Renal complications of IE take at least four forms: prerenal failure secondary to low cardiac output, microabscess formation caused by septic emboli, glomerular dysfunction resulting from circulating immune complexes, and renal failure caused by antibiotic toxicity.

Embolic events are common in IE patients (Fig. 15-6), with a reported prevalence of 43% in NVE, 67% in IV

drug-associated IE, and 25% in PVE. St Ting and colleagues report a 19% occurrence of splenic emboli in their series of patients with IV drug-related endocarditis. TO Occurrence is about 5% in the usual type of left-sided NVE. Metastatic infection of viscera is typically caused by *Staphylococcus*. Other classic peripheral manifestations of IE (e.g., petechiae, Osler nodes, splinter hemorrhages) are infrequently seen now, probably because of earlier intervention in the disease process. Multiple coronary emboli may result in myocardial infarction and ventricular dysfunction; the highest risk of embolic complications occurs with *S. aureus*, *Candida*, and HACEK (*Haemophilus*, *Actinobacillus*, *Cardiobacterium*, *Eikenella*, and *Kingella*) species. P5

About half the embolic complications of IE are associated with neurologic manifestations, and one fourth to one third of patients with NVE or PVE at some time have neurologic complications, 90% of which are related to emboli in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery. H4,82 Presence of S. aureus increases risk of neurologic complications. D6,V4 Stroke is the most common neurologic event. Vegetations are seen on echocardiography in about 40% of patients with neurologic complications and in about 30% of patients without neurologic sequelae. Some characteristics of vegetations visualized on TTE or TEE (e.g., density, mobility) may not be helpful in defining emboli risk. D6 Cerebral embolism generally occurs before the start of antibiotic therapy, with risk of stroke falling rapidly after initiation of effective antibiotics. D10 A European multicenter study estimated the prevalence of acute ischemic stroke at 12% (CL 10%-14%) on hospital admission, but only 3.7% (2.7%-4.9%) after start of appropriate antibiotic therapy.<sup>T5</sup> Data from the International Collaboration on Endocarditis indicated a stroke incidence of 4.8 per 1000 patient-days during the first week of antibiotic therapy, which decreased to 1.7 per 1000 patient-days in the second week and fell further thereafter. D12 After instituting antibiotic therapy, however, both absolute vegetation size and observed increase in vegetation size are associated with increased embolic risk<sup>V4</sup> (Fig. 15-7). Large vegetations are commonly caused by the HACEK group of organisms and fungi.

The most devastating neurologic complication is *intra*cerebral hemorrhage, which complicates about 5% of IE cases

Key: *CI*, Confidence interval; *RR*, relative risk. (From Vilacosta and colleagues. V4)

and carries a mortality exceeding 50%.H2,S3 The pathophysiology may involve septic arteritis with erosion of the vessel wall during uncontrolled infection, hemorrhage following cerebral infarction, or rupture of a mycotic aneurysm.D10 For patients on chronic anticoagulation who develop neurologic symptoms, anticoagulation should be discontinued (or maintained at low therapeutic levels in patients with a mechanical prosthetic valve) until intracranial hemorrhage can be excluded by CT scanning or MRI.

Medical treatment alone (vs. operative) increases risk of embolism.L1 However, delaying repair of the cardiac lesion is usually advised in the presence of central nervous system (CNS) complications.G4 Morbidity is less when repair is done in the presence of cerebral infarction versus cerebral hemorrhageE1 (see Indications for Operation). Evidence indicates that cerebral mycotic emboli will regress after extirpation of the valvar septic lesion, so early cardiac operation in patients with mycotic aneurysm and cerebral abscess may be advisable.M14

## Mortality

Mortality associated with IE is reported at 15% to 20% during the initial hospitalization and 20% to 30% during the first year.M6,T5 Early mortality is similar between NVE and PVE and between mitral and aortic valve IE. Gram-negative bacillus and fungal IE carry a mortality exceeding 50%.M23 Development of heart failure, intracardiac abscess, embolism, a large mobile vegetation, hemodynamic instability, altered mental status, immunocompromise, and advanced age have also been identified as risk factors for mortality.M5,T2

## THERAPY

# Antibiotics

Several blood cultures should routinely be obtained before initiating antibiotic therapy. Over half of cases can be managed solely with antibiotics.B1 Because antibiotic penetration of vegetations is difficult, prolonged parenteral antibiotic administration is advisable. Once antibiotics are started, blood cultures should be drawn every 1 to 2 days until they become negative. Total duration of antibiotic therapy is counted from the time of the first negative culture.

Vancomycin and aminoglycoside therapy should be guided by blood levels to ensure adequate dosing while minimizing toxicity. Aminoglycosides are often used in combination with a cell wall–active agent (β-lactam or vancomycin) to effect synergy (by increasing aminoglycoside entry into bacteria) in treating staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci. Standard antibiotic recommendations are listed in Table 15-2 for NVE and Table 15-3 for PVE.M5 Detailed recommendations about antibiotic therapy for IE are available from the American Heart Association.B1

#### Surgery

About 40% to 45% of all patients with IE undergo surgical therapy.M5 Goals of operative therapy are to (1) remove infected tissue and drain abscesses, (2) restore or reconstruct atrioventricular or ventriculoarterial continuity, and (3) reverse the hemodynamic abnormality. Drainage of abscesses, débridement of areas of necrosis, and improvement of mechanical function by repair or replacement of infected valves are done as required. Operation is also aimed at closing acquired defects (e.g., VSD, ring abscess, fistula, aneurysm) and in children may include repairing the underlying malformation.

All operations for IE are done through a partial or full median sternotomy. Presence of adhesive or suppurative pericarditis is strong evidence of previous perforation at the aortic or mitral ring or ring abscess.F2,U2 It is prudent to use bicaval cannulation to allow flexibility in the presence of burrowing abscesses, acquired septal perforation, unexpected right-sided valve involvement, and complex aortic root reconstruction. Intraoperative TEE is extremely useful to diagnose and plan treatment of the various manifestations of the infectious process. In left-sided IE, minimal manipulation of the heart

should be the rule to avoid dislodging infected thrombotic material or vegetations. As in other valvar procedures, myocardial management is accomplished with antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia supplemented with moderate systemic hypothermia (see "Methods of Myocardial Management during Cardiac Surgery" in Chapter 3). Thorough excision of infected tissue is performed with drainage of abscesses and closure of defects.

Operation for aortic IE should involve examining the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve and its chordae for drop lesions. It is sometimes necessary to open the left atrium to examine the posterior leaflet apparatus. Similarly, when mitral endocarditis is present, the possibility of concomitant aortic vegetations should be considered. However, absence of a murmur or thrill, presence of a competent aortic valve, and no echocardiographic evidence of vegetations at the aortic area argue against aortic involvement and preclude need for inspecting the valve.

Reparative procedures may be done on the mitral valve when the vegetation is healed, small, or discrete and does not involve a major portion of the tensor apparatus. It may include closing small perforations of the posterior or anterior leaflet using autologous or bovine pericardium or direct suturing (Fig. 15-8). Small vegetations may be stripped from chordae tendineae. Major destruction of the mitral leaflets by active infection presents a unique challenge if reconstruction is considered. Although one approach is valve replacement for all but small vegetations, the increased risk of early PVE in the setting of active infection (particularly in the setting of ongoing positive blood cultures) argues for concerted efforts at valve reconstruction. After débridement of infected tissue, a sliding anuloplasty technique (see Chapter 11) may be applicable to reconstruct commissural areas. Partial leaflet resection, pericardial patch replacement of mid-leaflet areas, or both may be needed. The remaining orifice size following reconstruction must be large enough (generally 25 mm in the average adult or a *z* value of −2 or greater in children) to prevent important mitral stenosis. Suture anuloplasty may be preferable to a prosthetic ring in an actively infected anulus, but a biodegradable anuloplasty ring has been suggested by Pektok and colleagues.P2

In the absence of active IE, as defined by positive blood cultures and overt inflammation at the site of vegetation, mitral repair of the classic type can be accomplished. Triangular resection of a portion of the anterior leaflet or quadrangular resection of a portion of the posterior leaflet may be performed, supplemented by inserting a partial or complete anular ring. Partial leaflet resection and anuloplasty procedures for tricuspid valve endocarditis can be applied on a more liberal basis (Fig. 15-9).

At the time of mitral valve resection, the posteroinferior portion of the mitral anulus should be inspected because the usual myocardial ring abscess occurs in this location. In infection of the aortic root, the abscess is usually found just posterior to the membranous portion of the ventricular septum or at the posterior portion of the septum just anterior to the orifice of the left coronary artery. When found, abscesses should be totally evacuated and surrounding tissue débrided. The concept of atrioventricular or ventriculoarterial discontinuity must be kept in mind. The infecting process often erodes those junctions, with potential or actual separation. In mitral valve IE with left atrioventricular discontinuity, the defect can be handled in several ways. Often a simple variation

of the usual valve replacement technique is appropriate; interrupted horizontal mattress sutures anchored with felt or pericardial pledgets are placed on the ventricular aspect of the mitral anulus, brought up through the left atrial aspect, and then through the prosthetic sewing ring. Deep bites are necessary. This can be done only after thorough débridement of the infected tissue within the mitral ring (Fig. 15-10).

In more extensive ring abscess or often in PVE with abscess, a different type of reconstruction is necessary. The atrioventricular discontinuity is bridged by a patch fashioned from a sheet of autologous or bovine pericardium. The ventricular aspect is anchored to the endocardium and myocardium using deep bites of continuous 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene suture. The superior aspect of this tissue reconstruction is anchored to the atrial endocardium with a similar suture.

Various maneuvers have been suggested for seating valves in the aortic position in the presence of frank abscesses of the aortic root. The advantage of tissue valves over mechanical valves in preventing reinfection has not been conclusively demonstrated. In the aortic area, however, stentless tissue valves, either allografts or xenografts, have some advantage in that their pliability allows some flexibility in reconstructing continuity between the ventricle and aorta. When stentmounted valves—either mechanical or tissue—are used, a technique using felt or bovine pericardial buttressed horizontal mattress sutures is advised. The mattress is placed on the ventricular aspect of the aortic anulus or from outside the aortic wall, dissecting the aortic root upstream in its noncoronary and posterior left coronary aspects and occasionally opening the right ventricular outflow tract to place pledgeted sutures from the infundibular septum through the aortic anulus.

When a simple small abscess lies under the left coronary ostium, evacuation, débridement, and patch closure of the defect can be accomplished. The stent-mounted or stentless tissue prosthesis is then placed in its usual orthotopic position using techniques similar to those required in noninfected cases (see Chapter 12). In many patients with important aortic valve IE, full root replacement offers the most satisfactory solution (Fig. 15-11). Infected tissue is first débrided, and formal root replacement is done in the usual way, with particular emphasis on locating the upstream (proximal) suture line within the left ventricular outflow tract, thus appropriately bridging the left ventricular–aortic discontinuity. All infected tissue is thus exteriorized.

Ancillary procedures during valve replacement may be helpful. Some authorities suggest soaking the prosthetic device in an appropriate antibiotic, and others have irrigated

or swabbed the local area with antiseptic solution such as povidone-iodine or antibiotics specific for the infecting organism. In fungal endocarditis, irrigation of the local area with amphotericin or other antifungal agents may be efficacious.H9,M18,N1

When both the aortic and mitral valves are involved but infection is limited to the cusps, usual sequencing of operation is followed: aortotomy, then aortic valve resection, followed by left atriotomy and mitral valve resection. The mitral anulus is then sized and an appropriate mechanical device or bioprosthesis inserted. The aortic anulus is then sized and an appropriate mechanical or tissue prosthesis inserted. When infection is not limited to the leaflets, there may be destruction of aortomitral continuity with absence of the aortomitral curtain. In this case, seating of the mitral prosthesis is modified because much of the anterior lateral suture attachment of the sewing ring will be absent. As much of the mitral prosthesis as possible is inserted in the usual way. Attention is then redirected to the aortic exposure, and a new synthetic aortomitral curtain is formed with polyester or pericardium. Upstream or proximal anchoring is done with sutures to the sewing ring of the mitral prosthesis, and downstream aortoventricular continuity is established by suturing this curtain to the root of the aorta. Thereafter, the aortic prosthesis is inserted as usual, attaching the prosthesis in its right lateral aspect (noncoronary sinus aspect) to the reconstructed mitral curtain. Alternatively, the sewing ring of the aortic prosthesis can be attached where it interfaces directly to the sewing ring of the mitral prosthesis.D4

Treatment of associated infection, particularly peripheral mycotic aneurysm; brain, spleen, or liver abscess; and renal parenchymal infection, usually takes second priority to the intracardiac operation. Use of cardiopulmonary bypass does not generally exacerbate associated neurologic deficits except in the specific case of cerebral hemorrhage (see Special Situations and Controversies). Persisting infection after valve replacement should alert the surgeon to splenic and liver abscesses. Similarly, continued renal decompensation suggests the presence of renal parenchymal disease.

## SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

In general, patients undergoing operations for complications of IE are subject to the same early postoperative monitoring and intervention algorithms as non-IE patients undergoing similar operations for valve replacement or repair (see Chapter 5). Hemodynamic state is assessed by measuring or estimating cardiac output and measuring left atrial, right atrial, or pulmonary artery pressures, combined with assessing blood pressure and peripheral perfusion.

Occasionally, patients with an acute septic syndrome manifest decreased peripheral resistance with low, normal, or high cardiac output early postoperatively. Appropriate treatment may include use of phenylephrine, levarterenol, or arginine vasopressin to increase peripheral resistance. Mobilizing extravascular lung water may be important to facilitate extubation. Adequate diuretic therapy and positive endexpiratory pressure ventilation early postoperatively are then indicated.

In all patients, tissue should be obtained for Gram stain and subsequent culture and histologic analysis. Results of these studies are integrated into the postoperative care plan, with appropriate changes in antibiotic regimen. Because renal function often is compromised, antibiotic levels must be closely monitored during the initial stages of therapy to allow adjustment in dosing interval if renal function is changing.

Patients with compromised renal function often have increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels early postoperatively, followed by a decline to near-normal levels over the next 3 to 7 days. Monitoring renal function is therefore important, and pharmacologic therapy with large doses of diuretics is often indicated. In some patients, temporary renal dialysis is necessary. Some surgeons may want to follow white blood cell counts or phase reactants over the postoperative period to monitor resolution of sepsis. If a septic picture continues, possible involvement of peripheral sites should be investigated.

Protocols for anticoagulation are the same in IE patients as in those having similar devices without IE.

Antibiotic treatment, most often administered IV, is continued for 4 to 6 weeks based on the type of organism and its sensitivity to antimicrobials. In the case of fungal endocarditis, oral treatment with ketoconazole or fluconazole may be appropriate for 3 to 6 months.

## RESULTS

#### Early (Hospital) Death

*Native Valve Endocarditis*

Hospital mortality for valve operations (and associated procedures) in patients with IE varies between 4% and 30%.B4,D3,D13,G5,H3,J1,L3,M9,M15 The variation can be ascribed to several factors, most notably the difference in risk between operation in the acute vs. healed stages of endocarditis (see Box 15-1 for definitions). In general, operations for healed IE are performed after a full course of antibiotic therapy.

Other factors affecting the variation in reported hospital mortality reflect the incremental risks for an operation, as discussed later.

Operative treatment of IE is in reality a combined medicalsurgical treatment, and timing of the operation is an important factor in patient survival. However, it is convenient to compare strictly medical (nonoperative) treatment of IE with results of operative treatment. In general, the more urgent the surgical indication and the more severe the heart failure, the better the surgical results compared with medical therapy. However, no prospective or randomized studies have been done, so patients in the nonoperative medical group may not be strictly comparable with those in the surgical group. Richardson and colleagues reported that operative treatment in 81 patients with NVE resulted in 11 deaths (14%; CL 10%-19%), compared with 24 deaths (44%; CL 37%-52%) in 54 patients treated medically.R2 Operative mortality was affected by urgency of operation. For elective operations (next convenient operative date), mortality was 5%, for urgent operations (next day) 16%, and for emergency operations in patients with severe heart failure and low cardiac output (immediate operation) 33%.

Operations in IE patients often demand complex procedures that may affect hospital mortality after valve repair or replacement.D13,L3 Complexity of the procedure is frequently dictated by duration of the illness and particularly by the infecting organism. Tissue destruction is characteristic of staphylococcal and some gram-negative organisms and is much less likely to occur in streptococcal or pneumococcal endocarditis. In reports from Bauernschmitt and Middlemost and their colleagues, however, early results of valve replacement did not seem to be adversely affected by excessive complexity of the procedure.B4,M9 Rather, preoperative complications and severity indices have a more profound influence on mortality.

Often, IE can be successfully treated without operative intervention in children. Nomura and colleagues reported on 98 patients seen over 13 years, 30 of whom were treated operatively, with a hospital mortality of 6.7%.N4 The

remaining patients were treated medically, with a 10% hospital mortality. Tolan and colleagues reviewed 132 published reports in which children underwent operative intervention during active endocarditis.T11 Hospital survival was 77%. Only 67% of patients had preoperative conditions thought to predispose them to IE, and about one quarter of those were operated on for infection associated with patent ductus arteriosus.

# *Prosthetic Valve Endocarditis*

PVE is an incremental risk factor for operative mortality in the domain of all IE.R2 Again, overall survival for patients with PVE is improved in those treated operatively compared with those treated medically. Although results may not be strictly comparable, most series report a difference in outcome when operative treatment of NVE is compared with PVE. In the Brigham and Women's Hospital experience, mortality was 22% in 49 PVE patients vs. 6% in 109 NVE patients.L3 Several factors more prevalent in the PVE group are likely responsible for this difference, including reoperation, prevalence of abscess, anular erosion and perianular aneurysm, insidious onset of infection, and fastidious or fungal organisms. However, Sabik and colleagues at the Cleveland Clinic report a 3.9% (CL 2%-7%) hospital mortality among 103 patients managed with radical débridement of infected tissue and aortic root replacement with a cryopreserved allograft.S1

# Time-Related Survival

Late survival after valve replacement for NVE is good, but not as good as with similar operations done in the absence of endocarditis (Fig. 15-12). Death and other events late after operation often are not related to IE or recurrent IE but rather to other conditions associated with heart disease, such as the valve replacement device and associated complications, myocardial dysfunction, and coronary artery disease. Using

mechanical valves exclusively, Bauernschmitt and colleagues reported 81% survival among 138 patients after 8 years.B4

There is an early, high-peaking hazard for death after operation, and then a constant later phase (Fig. 15-13). Survival is lower in patients who have PVE than in those with NVE (Fig. 15-14). Recurrent IE, nonstreptococcal organisms, and heart failure are associated with late death after valve replacement.

Data for long-term survival after heart valve replacement in IE patients are typified by those reported by d'Udekem and colleagues from Toronto; survival at 10 years was 61% ± 6%.D13 Aranki and colleagues, in two separate publications from Brigham and Women's Hospital, reported 81% to 83% 5-year survival and 61% to 63% 10-year survival for both mitral and aortic valve replacement.A3,A4

## Incremental Risk Factors

Several factors portend higher mortality with operative treatment for IE. A strong risk is hemodynamic deterioration,B4,D3,H3 characterized as preoperative shock, advanced heart failure, or advanced NYHA functional class. Some have also found a relationship with low preoperative cardiac index.L3 A second important risk factor is the infecting organism. Nonstreptococcal organisms, primarily staphylococci, increase operative risk. Staphylococcal infection is generally associated with abscesses, and abscesses independently may also increase risk.B4,H3,L3 Likewise, most studies report that PVE is associated with a lower early postoperative survival than NVE.B4,L3,M7 Additional incremental risk factors are older age, renal dysfunction, longer cardiopulmonary bypass time, acute vs. healed IE, insidious onset of infection, and associated procedures (Fig. 15-15). A 20-year analysis from Berlin identified preoperative ventilation, mitral valve abscess, and age older than 60 years as risk factors for early mortality following operation for mitral valve endocarditis.M21

David and colleagues identified preoperative cardiogenic or septic shock and abscess formation in both mitral and aortic anuli as risk factors for hospital mortality in patients with periannular extension.D5 Anguera and colleagues found moderate or severe heart failure, PVE, and urgent or emergency operation to be major risk factors for mortality.A2

(From Moon and colleagues.M13)

#### In-Hospital Morbidity

A few IE patients have continuing episodes of sepsis despite an apparently adequate cardiac operation. Almost uniformly, the source of this sepsis is not the heart; however, an overlooked valvar lesion must be sought, generally by repeat TEE. There is a high prevalence of splenic and other visceral infarcts, emboli, or abscesses,M3 but usually these do not cause continuing sepsis and are amenable to continued antibiotic therapy. Renal parenchymatous disease as a cause of sepsis is rare, as are cerebral mycotic aneurysms. Peripheral mycotic aneurysms are a potential source of continuing sepsis.

New or evolving conduction abnormalities preoperatively reflect evolution of the cardiac sepsis or may result from coronary emboli. Postoperatively, heart block occurs more often than in patients without endocarditis. In most situations, this is a predictable occurrence resulting from the radical débridement necessary to eradicate infections around the aortic root, mitral valve apparatus, and ventricular septum.

Most observers have noticed increased postoperative bleeding. Inflamed tissue, inflammatory pericarditis, complex reconstructions, renal dysfunction, and platelet dysfunction may play a role in excessive bleeding.

A devastating complication is a new or deepening neurologic deficit after valve replacement. Even with meticulous surgical technique, friable vegetations may dislodge to cause new CNS deficits. More frequently, however, an existing CNS finding is aggravated by operation. Ting and colleagues found evidence of cerebral septic emboli in 45 (42%) of 106 patients who underwent valve replacement for IE.T8 Neurologic complications after valve replacement included postoperative strokes in 6%, cerebral abscesses in 2%, and seizures in 1%. Presence of a hemorrhagic infarct preoperatively predisposes patients to perioperative stroke (see further discussion under Special Situations and Controversies).

## Recurrent Infection

Some institutions report few cases of subsequent reinfection even when operation is done early in the course of NVE. Despite 20% of patients requiring valve replacement in the UAB series having uncontrolled infection at operation, no cases of subsequent PVE occurred.R2 This finding is similar to the experience of Utley and Mills and of Okies and colleagues, who reported that reinfections were rare in such patients and emphasized the importance of adequate débridement of infected areas.O2,U1 In each of the studies, however, follow-up was short. Indeed, recurrent infection after valve replacement (or repair) does occur. In Larbalestier and colleagues' report, 18 of 109 patients surviving surgery for NVE underwent reoperation.L3 Eight had developed recurrent endocarditis. Recurrent IE is more common when the initial organism is nonstreptococcal and when there has been major destruction of the anulus or surrounding valve structures. This finding is reflected in Aranki's report, in which freedom from recurrent endocarditis in *acute* aortic IE surgical patients was 89%  $\pm$  3% at 5 years and 83%  $\pm$  4% at 10 years, vs. 96%  $\pm$  3% at 5 years and 86%  $\pm$  6% at 10 years in patients with healed aortic valve IE.<sup>A4</sup>

Freedom from reoperation is higher when the mitral valve is involved (compared with the aortic valve), reflecting less anular destruction. In a series reporting results of operation for mitral valve IE at Brigham and Women's Hospital, freedom from reoperation at 5 and 10 years was  $92\% \pm 4\%$ and  $62\% \pm 13\%$  for acute endocarditis and  $94\% \pm 4\%$  and 84% $\pm$  10% for healed endocarditis (P = .7), respectively.<sup>A3</sup> There was little difference in recurrent IE at 10 years for patients operated on for NVE (85%) vs. PVE (82%), although longterm survival was better for those with NVE. Reinfection with the same or different organism is common in drug abusers, and late mortality is greater in that group. In Hiraztka's experience, late mortality was 39% in drug abusers vs. 7% for non-drug users. H6

There is some controversy as to whether a tissue valve, particularly a cryopreserved allograft, is preferable for use in aortic NVE. In 108 patients, Haydock and colleagues reported a small but statistically significant difference in incidence of recurrent IE in patients having allografts vs. prosthetic valves<sup>H3</sup> (Fig. 15-16). Hazard functions were qualitatively different for allografts; there was a constant phase of hazard when an allograft was used, but an early peaking hazard phase and late rising phase when a prosthetic device was used (Fig. 15-17). In a similar study, McGiffin and colleagues noted that allografts in the aortic position had a higher freedom from recurrent endocarditis than mechanical or xenograft valves<sup>M7</sup> (Fig. 15-18). Thus, if there is an advantage among valve substitutes, it is conferred uniquely by allografts. In both Haydock's and McGiffin's series, where aortic valve replacement was done with allograft valves, freedom from recurrent endocarditis was about

however. H3,M13,M15 In 138 patients who received only mechanical valves, reoperation-free survival was similar (77%), suggesting that mechanical prostheses may perform as well as

allografts when operation is done for aortic NVE.B4 However, reoperation-free survival does not comparably address differences in early hazard for recurrent infection. Lytle and colleagues reoperated on 146 patients with PVE, with 19 (13%) in-hospital deaths.L5 Subsequent reoperation was performed in 15% of hospital survivors, and in those who had aortic valve replacement, reoperation-free survival was similar among those who received biological, mechanical, or allograft valves (Fig. 15-19). Similar findings were reported by Nguyen and colleagues.N2

Thus, for aortic NVE, some evidence suggests that an allograft is the preferable replacement device. For all aortic PVE, mitral NVE, or mitral PVE operations, there is no evidence indicating the superiority of xenografts over mechanical devices.

## INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

In *healed* NVE, indications for operation are related primarily to hemodynamic severity of the valvar lesion or defect. It follows that, in general, results of operation in healed endocarditis are identical to those in patients without endocarditis having the same hemodynamic disturbance (see Indications for Operation in Chapters 11 to 14).

In the setting of *active* NVE, consensus is lacking about some of the specific indications for surgical intervention.T10 Nevertheless, consensus has emerged from both the European and North American medical communities about general indications for operationB14,P5 (Box 15-4). Specific recommendations regarding timing of operationP5 are listed in Box 15-5. Minor variations exist in the recommendations from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines and European Society of CardiologyT6 (Table 15-4).

Among the indications for operation for IE, surgery for acute heart failure provides the greatest survival benefit.R3,V3 Operation is best performed within about 1 week of presentation of heart failure symptoms, urgently in the presence of subtle deterioration, and emergently with rapid or marked hemodynamic compromise. Heart failure is usually secondary to valve regurgitation but occasionally results from valve obstruction or intracardiac shunting. Acute, severe aortic regurgitation is poorly tolerated and often requires emergency operation. Patients with reasonably compensated heart failure may benefit from several days of medical therapy with diuretics and afterload reduction prior to surgery. However, extended delay is not recommended because of the tendency for insidious progression with a marked increase in operative risk.M9

Early surgical treatment of staphylococcal NVE, regardless of hemodynamic compromise, is usually advocated. However, there are isolated cases of successful medical treatment. Development of new-onset atrioventricular block is highly predictive of abscess formation; after verification by TEE, prompt operation should be performed.

Because recidivism is common in drug abusers, surgical treatment of *right-sided endocarditis* may occasionally be appropriately delayed or abandoned in favor of nonsurgical treatment. This approach may be particularly appropriate when replacement is more likely to be done than repair, because reinfection often follows tricuspid valve replacement. Tricuspid valve resection without replacement is also an option, although hemodynamic sequelae are important limitations to this approachD1 (see Chapter 14). Recurrent pulmonary emboli are *not* an indication for operation unless fever persists despite 3 weeks of antibiotic therapy in the absence of a pulmonary abscess.M12

Right-sided endocarditis in IV drug abusers is caused by *S. aureus* in 80% of patients. Tricuspid valve replacement has been advocated in IE patients who have large vegetations and fever that persist for more than 3 weeks despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Bayer and colleagues, however, correlating echocardiographic findings with clinical outcome in 53 patients with tricuspid NVE secondary to *S. aureus,* found that 50 patients were cured with antibiotics; only 3 required surgery. Of 38 vegetations detected, 21 were 10 mm or greater in diameter. Similarly, recurrent pulmonary emboli were not correlated with demonstrable vegetations or with size of the vegetation.B5,B6

Surgical intervention in *early PVE* usually is recommended, particularly when the offending organism is *Staphylococcus* or a fastidious organism. In the complete absence of heart failure, emboli, or a large vegetation, however, nonsurgical treatment may suffice.

The clinical presentation and natural history of *late PVE* (>2 months after initial operation) are similar to those of active NVE. Therefore, indications for valve replacement in late PVE—advanced degree of heart failure, emboli, continuing sepsis, and staphylococcal organism—are similar to those for NVE. Timing of operation for either NVE or PVE should be based on clinical considerations, not on duration of antibiotic treatment.

Echocardiography has become an integral part of the algorithm for diagnosing and treating endocarditis. Vegetation size as the sole indication for surgery remains controversial. However, the presence of mobile vegetations, vegetations larger than 10 mm, and obstructing vegetations warrant consideration for operative therapy. In left-sided NVE, Sanfilippo and colleagues found that vegetation size, extent, mobility, and consistency were univariable predictors of complicationsS5 (Fig. 15-20). Patients with a vegetation greater than 10 mm in diameter on echocardiography have a substantially higher risk of embolic phenomena than those with small or no vegetations (47% vs. 19%).M7 It must be stressed that

Modified from ACC/AHA 2006 Guidelines.B14,P5

*a* Surgery should be performed immediately, irrespective of antibiotic therapy, in patients with persistent pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock. If congestive heart failure disappears with medical therapy and there are no other surgical indications, intervention can be postponed to allow a period of days or weeks of antibiotic treatment under careful clinical and echocardiographic observation. In patients with well-tolerated severe valvar regurgitation or prosthetic dehiscence and no other reasons for surgery, conservative therapy under careful clinical and echocardiographic observation is recommended, with consideration of deferred surgery after resolution of the infection, depending upon tolerance of the valve lesion.

Surgery is contraindicated for at least 1 month after intracranial hemorrhage unless neurosurgical or endovascular intervention can be performed to reduce bleeding risk. *b* In all cases, surgery for preventing embolism must be performed very early because embolic risk is highest during the first days of antibiotic therapy.

vegetation size is only one of several criteria recognized as indications for surgical intervention. However, the combination of a recent nonhemorrhagic CNS event, a highly mobile (prolapsed vegetations crossing the plane of valve leaflet coaptation during the cardiac cycle) vegetation, and vegetation size greater than 10 mm while a patient is on effective antibiotic therapy should mandate serious consideration for operation.D10

Indications for surgical intervention in *children* are much the same as those in adults: heart failure, continuing sepsis,

and embolization. In children, however, large masses associated with chronic right-sided indwelling catheters are often indications for surgical extirpation. Small right-sided masses associated with indwelling catheters in both children and adults can be treated with antibiotics, heparinization, and nonsurgical removal of the catheter.

# SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

# Timing of Operation in Patients with Central Nervous System Events

The risk of urgent operation for IE complicated by stroke remains controversial. There is general agreement that if at all possible, operation should be delayed at least 4 weeks following an intracerebral hemorrhage,A1 because the risk of deepening stroke or death resulting from a neurologic complication is particularly serious in patients with demonstrable cerebral hemorrhage (as opposed to infarction) as diagnosed with brain CT or MRI. On the other hand, a number of studies have shown that cardiopulmonary bypass is not particularly dangerous (risk of worsening neurologic event 3%-6%R6) in patients with cerebral infarction without hemorrhageH13,R6 or in those with cerebral mycotic aneurysm. In fact, mycotic aneurysms have been shown to regress in the presence of an adequate cardiac operation and continued antibiotic therapy.M14

Eishi and colleagues reviewed 2523 surgical cases of IE and found that 10% of patients had associated cerebral complications.E1 In-hospital mortality of those patients was 11%; cerebral infarction occurred in 65%, cerebral bleeding in 32%, and abscess in 3%. Exacerbation of cerebral complications (including death), according to interval from onset of cerebral infarction to cardiac operation, occurred in 46% of patients operated on within 24 hours, 44% of those operated on days 2 through 7, 17% of those operated on days 8 through 14, 10% of those operated on days 15 through 28, and just 2% of those operated on after 4 weeks (Figure 15-21). Thus, an important correlation existed between the interval from onset of cerebral complications to operation and exacerbation of cerebral complications (*P* = .008). Preoperative risk factors affecting exacerbation of cerebral complications were severity of cerebral complication, interval

**Figure 15-21** Exacerbation of cerebral damage, including death related to cerebral injury, according to interval from onset of cerebral infarction until cardiac operation. Key: *CI,* Cerebral infarction. (From Eishi and colleagues.E1)

between complication and surgery, and uncontrolled heart failure.

Postoperative exacerbation of cerebral complications is more likely in patients with more severe preoperative manifestation of brain infarction. In the Eishi study of 51 patients without exacerbation of their cerebral complication, operation occurred an average of 15 days after diagnosis, compared with 8 days among 17 patients having exacerbationE1 (*P* = .01). Thus, exacerbation is inversely related to interval between diagnosis and operation. If cerebral infarction is not associated with hemorrhage, however, earlier operation is usually well tolerated.

In a large cohort of patients undergoing valve surgery after a neurologic complication of IE, Ruttman and colleagues found the risk of neurologic deterioration following brain infarction to be about 20% within 3 days, 20% to 50% between day 4 and 14, less than 10% after 14 days, and less than 1% after 4 weeks.R6 On the basis of these data, Angstwurm and colleagues recommended valve surgery within 72 hours if a patient with brain infarction (but without hemorrhage) has severe heart failure, and after 4 weeks if the patient remains stable on antibiotic therapy.A1 Urgent operation should be considered reasonably safe in patients with transient ischemic episodes or "silent" cerebral embolism.T4

## Preferred Device for Operation

Choice of valve replacement device depends on several factors, including likelihood of PVE, durability, need for anticoagulation, availability, and ease of insertion. However, factors such as adequate eradication of foci of infection and "best fit" also apply. For that reason, a number of choices may be available for patients with aortic IE. Although good results have been reported with mechanical or stented bioprosthetic valves, the preponderance of data suggests better outcome with an aortic allograft.M22 When abscess cavities can be excluded by a pliable allograft, this device is preferable.M21 On the other hand, when aortic root replacement is necessary, insufficient evidence exists to indicate that a tissue valve is superior to **Box 15-6** Diagnostic and Therapeutic Interventions Associated with a High Risk of Endocarditis*a*

a mechanical valved conduit (although indirect evidence would support the use of an allograft root).

Because tricuspid valve endocarditis frequently accompanies IV drug abuse, repair is preferred over replacement. If replacement is necessary, choice of device depends on the usual factors associated with tricuspid valve replacement (see Chapter 14). Tricuspid valve allografts have provided encouraging outcomes (see Chapter 14).

Repair is occasionally successful in mitral valve endocarditis, but most repairs are done when IE is healed rather than acute.M17 In the acute stage, a mechanical valve is a suitable option if satisfactory reconstruction is not possible following effective débridement.M13

In cases of extreme recurrent PVE despite multiple reoperations, cardiac transplantation may be considered if systemic foci of infection are absent.P1

## Guidelines for Antibiotic Prophylaxis

The important morbidity and mortality of IE despite its relative rarity has prompted development of national and international guidelines for prophylactic antibiotics, beginning in 1955.D9 Periodic revision of existing guidelines has been driven by emerging information about shifting patterns of disease. A rise in the prevalence of staphylococcal skin flora has been noted as the causative organism for communityacquired as well as iatrogenic nosocomial IE.H7 Treatment of IE has been complicated by emergence of multidrug resistance for streptococci, staphylococci, and enterococci.D9 Lack of complete concordance among various guidelines stems from the preponderance of case-control studies, animal data, and expert opinion in guiding the recommendations.

Patients considered at high or moderate risk have an increased risk of contracting IE from a transient bacteremia. High-risk groups include patients with a previous history of IE, prosthetic heart valves, surgically created conduits, and complex cyanotic congenital anomalies.D9 Moderate-risk groups include persons with acquired valvar heart disease, noncyanotic congenital heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and mitral valve prolapse with regurgitation or severe valve thickening. The risk of IE in patients with mitral valve prolapse and important mitral regurgitation is estimated to be five times that of the normal adult population.S10 Use of antibiotic prophylaxis for anyone with a systolic murmur has been deemed cost-effective in the British guidelines.D9 IE has been reported following colonoscopy,K1,S8 but transient bacteremia is not associated with CT colonography.R3
