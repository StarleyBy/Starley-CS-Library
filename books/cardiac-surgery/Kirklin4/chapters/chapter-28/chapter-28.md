#### DEFINITION

Acquired disease of the systemic veins entails obstruction partial or complete—of the major veins of the thorax. Veins of surgical importance are the superior and inferior venae cavae (SVC and IVC). Left and right brachiocephalic veins, including the jugular-subclavian vein confluence, are major tributaries of the SVC and may be considered collectively with conditions of the SVC. Congenital anomalies of the venae cavae and axillary vein conditions such as effort thrombosis are not considered in this chapter. Obstruction results from extrinsic compression, direct invasion by disease processes, or thrombosis. *SVC syndrome* is the result of venous hypertension in the head, neck, and arms caused by SVC obstruction.

# HISTORICAL NOTE

William Hunter described the first recorded case of SVC syndrome in 1757 in a patient with syphilitic aneurysm of the aorta.H6 SVC obstruction was due to compression by the aneurysm. William Osler described SVC compression in his classic text of 1892: "Along the convex border of the ascending part [of the aorta], aneurism frequently develops, and may grow to a large size.… In this situation the sac is liable indeed to compress the superior vena cava, causing engorgement of the vessels of the head and arm."O5 William Stokes' text of 1853 described SVC obstruction and noted the more frequent occurrence with cancer: "As an indication of intrathoracic tumour, an extensively varicose state of the superficial veins of the neck and thorax is probably less frequent in aneurismal than in cancerous disease.… The superior cava may be adherent to the tumour, and become narrowed, not only by pressure, but by adhesion of its internal surfaces."S14 Gomes and Hufnagel reviewed cases of SVC obstruction reported before 1975.G4 Data from more than 90 publications, including 1980 cases reported in the literature since 1934, were reviewed by Ahmann in 1984.A2 The clinical problem was reviewed by Nieto and Doty in 1986.N3

The first successful bypass operations for SVC obstruction by Klassen and colleagues in 1951 and Bricker and McAfee in 1952 were performed using autologous femoral vein grafts.B8,K4 In 1965, Hanlon and Danis used other large veins to replace or bypass the SVC, employing variously the femoral, subclavian, and jugular veins.H2 In 1962, Benvenuto and colleagues constructed a composite panel graft from pieces of saphenous vein for replacing the SVC.B3 The operative approach to relieve venous obstruction up to 1970 was reviewed by Haimovici and colleagues.H1 They concluded that autologous veins are preferable for venous replacement. All reported experimental and clinical experiences with vena cava replacement or bypass up to 1974 were reviewed by Scherck and colleagues.S3 A number of conduits had been tried, including autologous, homologous,T2 and heterologous vein, aorta, and various synthetic materials. These authors concluded that autologous vein grafts of nearly the same size as the SVC were most likely to remain patent. To obtain such a large autologous vein usually requires a large vein from elsewhere in the body, with resultant venous drainage problems, or constructing a composite graft from a smaller vein.

Synthetic grafts are attractive because of their convenience and availability and because of the variety of sizes available. In 1973, Effeney and colleagues reported successful bypass of the SVC using polyester grafts.E1 In 1977, Avasthi and Moghissi used a polyester graft interposed between the brachiocephalic vein on the left side and right atrial appendage to bypass the obstructed SVC.A5 Thrombosis of polyester grafts limited success of the procedure. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was used successfully as a venous replacement conduit in experimental venous operations in dogs.F2,H4,S11 Hiratzka and colleagues showed that PTFE and polyester were equally poor venous substitute conduits in the experimental setting, and that they did not approach the effective patency of autologous vein grafts.H5 Reichle and colleagues suggested that this was because autologous vein grafts have a living endothelial surface even after initial endothelial desquamation, whereas prosthetic graft inner surfaces are composed of collagen matrix.R1 Nevertheless, success using PTFE grafts has been reported. Antiplatelet-adhesive drugs may be of benefit in maintaining patency of PTFE grafts.H3 Dartevelle and colleagues reported that 12 of 13 PTFE grafts used to replace the SVC were patent an average of 24 months after operation.D1

Composite vein grafts constructed from the saphenous or external jugular veins, in paneled or longitudinal fashion, have been used clinically for SVC bypass or replacement (both techniques are discussed in detail later in this chapter).A4,S6 In 1974, Chiu and colleagues reported constructing a composite vein graft from the external jugular vein, which was matched to the size of the SVC.C3 The donor vein was opened longitudinally and wrapped in spiral fashion around a tubular stent of approximately the same size as the SVC. Vein edges were then sutured together to form the conduit. The graft occluded in the initial three experiments in dogs. After that, however, 10 consecutive grafts remained patent for up to 15 months. This report prompted successful application of this technique in humans by Doty and Baker in 1976.D7 Successful percutaneous balloon dilatation of the SVC in a child was reported by Rocchini and colleagues in 1982.R4 In 1986, Sherry and colleagues reported successful dilatation of an SVC stricture caused by pacemaker electrodes in an adult.S8 In 1987, Rosch and colleagues used an expandable wire stent to treat SVC obstruction caused by malignant disease that recurred after extensive radiation therapy.R7

# MORPHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS

#### Morphology

## *Superior Vena Cava*

The SVC is located in the middle mediastinum and is surrounded by relatively rigid structures including the trachea, right bronchus, aorta, pulmonary trunk, and perihilar and paratracheal lymph nodes. It is thin walled, compliant, and easily compressible. Pressure within it is low. The SVC originates as the confluence of right and left brachiocephalic veins and extends for a distance of 6 to 8 cm to the right atrium. It is inside the pericardial sac for the distal several cm of its course. The azygos vein is the only major venous channel that enters the SVC; it enters posteriorly just above the pericardial reflection and is an important venous collateral pathway.

## *Collateral Circulation*

SVC obstruction stimulates formation of extensive venous collateral circulation (Fig. 28-1). The azygos vein is the only major venous channel that enters the SVC and is the most important collateral pathway. When SVC obstruction is located caudad to a patent azygos vein, there is retrograde flow through the azygos and hemiazygos veins to the lumbar veins below the diaphragm and to the IVC. When obstruction is cephalad to the patent azygos vein, collateral veins in the neck allow blood flow to enter the azygos system and continue directly into the distal SVC below the obstruction. When connection of the azygos vein to the SVC is involved in the obstruction, more complex and varied pathways must develop to drain the upper body. One prominent system consists of the internal thoracic veins, which connect to superior and inferior epigastric veins and subsequently to the IVC by way of the external iliac veins. Lateral thoracic veins drain to thoracoepigastric veins; eventually, blood may enter the femoral veins. Paraspinous veins form a collateral network that connects to the IVC via lumbar veins. The esophageal venous network also can decompress the thorax via the left gastric vein to the portal system. This pathway is not very important unless esophageal varicosities develop, and only rarely are these associated with bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract. Subcutaneous veins are a particularly important means of bringing blood flow from the upper body to below the diaphragm via the IVC.

Despite extensive collateral circulation that may develop, venous pressure in the SVC as high as 200 to 500 cm of water has been recorded. Cerebral venous decompression may be provided through a single internal jugular vein, because the veins of the right and left sides of the brain are in continuity through midline venous sinuses.L8 Superior and inferior sagittal sinuses drain the cerebral hemispheres to the confluence of sinuses that communicate through transverse and sigmoid sinuses to either internal jugular vein. The cavernous venous sinuses also connect both sides of the brain to either internal jugular vein. Cerebral venous drainage, therefore, may remain adequate.

#### Pathogenesis

SVC obstruction may be caused by a spectrum of malignant (Table 28-1) and benign (Box 28-1) conditions. Disease in any adjacent anatomic structures may contribute to SVC syndrome. The common causes of SVC obstruction have changed over the past 50 years. In 1949, the most common were thoracic malignancy (33%), aortic aneurysm (30%), and chronic granulomatous mediastinitis (19%).M7 Up until 1962, approximately 25% were due to benign diseaseE2; between 1969 and 1979, that proportion decreased to 3%.L8 Currently, malignancies account for the majority of cases. Iatrogenic causes such as indwelling catheters are becoming more frequent, and an increasing number of

infectious causes are being reported in immunosuppressed patients.E3,R2

#### *Benign Causes*

Reviews from Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic reported mediastinal granulomatous disease resulting in fibrosing mediastinitis as a prominent cause of benign SVC obstruction.M1,P1 The most common etiologic agent is histoplasmosis, which causes a caseating granulomatous process in mediastinal lymph nodes that compresses, fibroses, and contracts around the SVC and may result in secondary thrombosis. Fibrosing mediastinitis resulting from radiation therapy can be progressive and involve the SVC years after radiation treatment has been completed.

Iatrogenic causes have been increasing in importance because of increased use of invasive intravenous procedures such as cardiac pacemaker electrodes, central venous and pulmonary artery catheters, hyperalimentation and chemotherapy catheters, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Mazzetti and colleagues reviewed pacemaker electrodes as a cause and found four cases of SVC obstruction among 2600 patients followed in a pacemaker clinic.M6 They also reviewed 37 cases reported in the literature and concluded that prevalence of this complication is likely lower than 1 in 1000. A more recent publication identified 104 patients from a review of 74 different publications.R2 Williard and colleagues reported the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center experience with thrombosis of long-term vascular access.W1 Occurrence of thrombosis of access catheters placed through the SVC was 7%, compared with 19% for catheters placed through the IVC. About half the thromboses involved just the catheter; the other half involved the blood vessel through which the catheter was introduced.

In infants, substantial morbidity is associated with chronic central venous access catheters.B4 In the series of Swaniker and Fonkalsrud, IVC occlusion occurred in 4.5% and SVC occlusion in 11% of 510 infants having 756 central venous catheters placed for parenteral nutrition.S16 Head and neck swelling developed in all with SVC occlusion, pleural effusions developed in 50%, and two infants died.

the SVC around these catheters is especially troublesome when they are required for permanent life support and cannot be conveniently removed. In addition, thrombosis frequently follows the entire intravascular course of the catheter and thus is extensive, involving the major SVC venous tributaries. SVC thrombosis can be an important complication after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Zreik and colleagues reported 7 of 60 neonates (12%; CL 7%-18%) had either complete or partial SVC obstruction.Z3 Other benign causes include benign tumor, vascular aneurysm, a variety of cardiac and pulmonary diseases, and mediastinal hematomas.

## *Malignant Causes*

Intrathoracic malignancy now accounts for more than 90% of SVC obstructions, with bronchogenic carcinoma responsible for 67% to 82%.N3 SVC syndrome develops in 3% to 15% of patients with bronchogenic carcinoma. Bronchogenic carcinoma cell type associated with SVC obstruction appears to be somewhat variable, which may in part be related to difference in tumor classification schemes used by different investigators. Squamous (epidermoid) carcinoma accounts for 22% to 27% of cases and appears to be relatively consistent across reports. Small-cell carcinoma is the most variable (18%-46%), although its etiologic role appears to be increasing. Lymphoma is the second most frequent cause of SVC obstruction, accounting for 5% to 15% of cases. These malignancies are located in the anterior mediastinum and produce obstruction by external compression from the front. Thoracic metastasis from extrathoracic malignancies, particularly breast and testicle, accounts for a small number of SVC obstructions.

Malignancy is also the most common cause of SVC obstruction in children. In contrast to adults, however, non-Hodgkin lymphoma is the leading etiology.I1

# CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

#### Superior Vena Cava Syndrome

Because *extrinsic compression* usually produces obstruction gradually, collateral circulation develops, the obstruction is usually well tolerated, and the patient has few if any signs and symptoms. If obstruction develops rapidly, as in malignant tumor invasion and in infants and children with central venous catheters, collateral circulation may not have time to develop and adequately decompress upper body veins. The most severe syndrome develops in cases of SVC thrombosis in which obstruction is sudden and collateral venous channels have no time to develop. Thrombosis may involve major caval tributaries as well and thus eliminate major collateral pathways. Thrombosis often accompanies SVC obstruction from any cause and compounds the problem because (1) subsequent fibrotic organization of the clot results in permanent SVC stenosis or closure, and (2) thrombosis does not respond to treatment directed at the primary disease process that resulted in the SVC obstruction.

Thoracic lymphatic ducts drain into the subclavian veins and are affected by venous hypertension associated with SVC obstruction. Pulmonary lymphatics may also be secondarily affected, leading to increased lung water and dyspnea. Respiratory insufficiency is frequently associated with acute SVC obstruction and may be difficult to manage. Chylous pleural effusion may result from thoracic lymphatic obstruction.

## Symptoms

Patients with SVC obstruction usually present with a well-established syndrome that is easily recognized and unmistakable.C1 Only rarely does complete SVC obstruction occur without noticeable signs or symptoms. The typical syndrome consists of swelling of face, neck, and arms; shortness of breath; orthopnea; and cough. Patients may notice tightness of a shirt collar and that their face is flushed and swollen, especially around the eyes. Other symptoms include hoarseness, stridor, tongue swelling, nasal congestion, epistaxis, dysphagia, headache, dizziness, syncope, lethargy, and

*a* Data from Mahajan.M1

chest pain. Symptoms are aggravated by bending forward, stooping, or lying down. Many patients become dyspneic when recumbent and must sleep in a chair.

#### Signs

The most common signs are dilatation and tortuosity of upper body veins, plethora or cyanosis of the face, and swelling of face, neck, or arms. Other signs include proptosis, glossal edema, rhinorrhea, laryngeal edema, mentation changes, elevated venous and cerebrospinal fluid pressures, and chylous pleural effusion.C1 Signs and symptoms suggesting cerebral or laryngeal edema were shown to be of prognostic importance by Lochridge and colleagues.L8 Headache, vertigo, visual disturbances, decreased mentation, stupor, somnolence, and convulsions indicate cerebral edemaK2,L8; hoarseness and stridor suggest laryngeal edema.

### Diagnosis

Clinical diagnosis is usually obvious. Location, degree, and cause of SVC obstruction should be characterized in every case. There is some controversy about how specific this characterization should be, because more than 90% of cases are due to malignancy. Some believe that palliation of the intrathoracic malignancy should proceed without delay. Others argue that SVC syndrome is seldom a medical emergency and should be characterized as completely as possible in an orderly fashion so that treatment can be specific. Although tissue diagnosis by biopsy can usually be obtained, in some cases it may be difficult and even hazardous to do so. Patients seek relief of symptoms of SVC and seldom complain of symptoms related to the etiologic cause of the obstruction. Treatment of SVC syndrome should be accompanied by diagnostic measures and therapy directed at the causative primary disease.

## *Chest Radiography*

Chest radiography is helpful but not specific in diagnosing SVC obstruction. Because bronchogenic carcinoma is the most common cause of SVC syndrome, the chest radiograph often shows a right-sided hilar mass. An anterior mediastinal mass suggests lymphoma.

## *Venography*

The most useful diagnostic procedure is bilateral arm contrast venographyD10,S13 (Fig. 28-2). It establishes:

- Location of SVC obstruction
- Degree of obstruction
- Degree of involvement of caval tributaries
- Extent of collateral venous pathways
- Extrinsic compression vs. intrinsic SVC obstruction

Identifying retrograde propagation of thrombosis that involves caval tributaries may indicate that caval obstructive symptoms are not likely to respond to nonoperative therapy.

Using venography in 36 patients, Stanford and Doty defined four patterns of venous circulation useful in planning therapyS13 (Box 28-2).

## *Digital Contrast Angiography, Venous Phase*

Digital contrast angiography in the venous phase is also helpful in assessing collateral circulation (Fig. 28-3).

**Box 28-2** Type of Superior Vena Cava Obstruction According to Venographic Pattern

# **Type I**

Partial obstruction (up to 90% stenosis) of the superior vena cava (SVC) with patency of the azygos–right atrial pathway

#### **Type II**

Near-complete to complete obstruction (90%-100%) of the SVC with patency and antegrade flow in the azygos–right atrial pathway

#### **Type III**

Near-complete to complete obstruction (90%-100%) of the SVC with reversal of azygos blood flow

#### **Type IV**

Complete obstruction of the SVC and one or more of the major caval tributaries, including the azygos systems

#### *Two-Dimensional Echocardiography*

Masses in the SVC are imaged with great clarity by twodimensional echocardiography (Fig. 28-4). The image is dynamic, so movement of obstructing lesions may be detected. It is useful in evaluating clot formation on central venous catheters and other devices.

#### *Computed Tomography*

Computed tomography (CT) provides an effective noninvasive means of analyzing the SVC and its tributaries. It has increasing importance in evaluating SVC syndrome and masses in the right atrium and IVC (Fig. 28-5). Its advantages are outlined by Moncada and colleaguesM11:

- Caval anatomy can be related to surrounding mediastinal structures.
- Mediastinal masses or lymph node pathology relative to the SVC can be located.
- Directed needle biopsy of mediastinal masses is facilitated.
- Patency of the internal jugular veins in the neck can be assessed despite extensive occlusion of tributaries of the SVC.

## *Magnetic Resonance Imaging*

Magnetic resonance imaging is useful in assessing graft patency after operation for SVC syndrome.L5

#### *Other Diagnostic Methods*

Other diagnostic methods including ultrasonography, positron emission tomography (PET), cytology, isotope venography, bronchoscopy, lymph node biopsy, mediastinal biopsy, mediastinotomy with biopsy, and exploratory thoracotomy are indicated for individual cases.A1,C1,J2 However, risks of interventional studies—patient discomfort, bleeding, and interruption of venous collaterals—should be weighed against the probability of a successful diagnosis. Invasive diagnostic tests may worsen SVC syndrome and should be avoided whenever possible.

**Figure 28-2** Bilateral arm venogram showing obstruction of superior vena cava (SVC). **A,** Contrast injected via right basilic vein shows complete occlusion of SVC at right brachiocephalic vein junction. Collateral veins have formed in cervical region. There is reflux into right internal jugular vein, suggesting venous pressure is elevated enough to cause regurgitation of the valve at the jugular–subclavian vein confluence. **B,** Contrast injected via left cephalic vein shows left brachiocephalic vein occlusion back nearly to left jugular-subclavian confluence. A stump of brachiocephalic vein is accessible for attaching a bypass graft. Collateral veins formed in the cervical region communicate with paravertebral veins.

## NATURAL HISTORY

The natural history of SVC obstruction and accompanying SVC syndrome is variable and depends on etiology of the obstruction, rapidity of onset, extent of the obstructive process, and extent of collateral venous circulation. Collateral venous circulation usually develops rapidly in response to SVC obstruction and is often sufficient to relieve SVC syndrome. The relationship of SVC obstruction to location and patency of the azygos vein has an important effect on natural history.S13 When the azygos vein is closed, central thoracic collateral circulation is eliminated and SVC syndrome is worse because venous drainage from the upper body is dependent on smaller, less reliable venous channels in the chest wall and skin.

Even minimal tumor invasion of the SVC or compression by benign tumor may stimulate formation and propagation of blood clot within the vena cava. Malignant diseases resulting in acute SVC obstruction and thrombosis may not resolve with thrombolytic and radiation therapy. Acute SVC obstruction associated with signs of cerebral or laryngeal edema results in death within 6 weeks, apparently related to SVC syndrome rather than the primary etiology of the caval obstruction.L8 The malignant process responds to therapy in

a variable manner depending in part on cell type, ultimately determining the patient's fate. Surgical intervention may be beneficial if the SVC syndrome is life threatening. It allows treatment of the malignancy to proceed in an orderly fashion and provides patient comfort.

Fibrosis associated with clot resolution and late clot propagation may be accompanied by worsening of symptoms and signs of SVC syndrome, despite adequate venous collateralization. Thus, SVC obstruction may persist even though there appears to be good response to treatment of the tumor. Some benign causes of SVC obstruction lead to severe and relentless inflammation and fibrosis, resulting in recurrent and extending obstruction.

Clot propagation within the venous system proximal to the primary site of SVC obstruction may lead to progression of SVC syndrome in patients with benign etiology. Clot formation around indwelling catheters is especially prone to extensive thrombosis of the SVC and major thoracic and cervical venous tributaries. Some patients with SVC obstruction may never develop adequate collateral circulation even though the causative process is stabilized or eliminated.

## TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

Restoring thoracic venous drainage usually requires bypass of obstructed native venous channels using, when available, autologous tissue conduits to provide optimum long-term patency. Venous conduits include spiral saphenous vein, femoral vein, simple saphenous vein, and composite autologous vein grafts.D6 In unusual situations, other venous conduits, such as composite azygos vein–IVC or jugular vein–femoral vein grafts, can be used. If autologous venous tissue is not available, aortic allografts, venous allografts, and autologous or homologous pericardial tubes can be used as conduit. Prosthetic grafts are generally inferior to autologous tissue grafts.

Successful bypass grafting depends on (1) adequate size of the conduit and (2) proper orientation. *Graft diameter* should closely match that of the native inflow vein to prevent residual obstructive flow gradients. To prevent graft kinking and obstruction, *graft length* should be measured so that it is not redundant. Both graft inflow and outflow sites should be free of intraluminal obstructions such as atrial trabeculations, adherent venous thrombus, or abnormal vascular intima.

#### Spiral Saphenous Vein Graft

The most extensive experience has been with the spiral saphenous vein graft conduit, a concept developed experimentally by Chiu and colleagues and applied clinically by Doty and Baker.C3,D7

Operation is performed through a median sternotomy or via a smaller incision using a partial upper half sternotomy (Fig. 28-6). A simultaneous incision is made in the thigh over the course of the saphenous vein. The left brachiocephalic vein is mobilized to the left internal jugular–left subclavian vein confluence. When the brachiocephalic vein and subclavian-jugular confluence are thrombosed, it is necessary to mobilize either the left or right internal jugular vein, which then becomes the inflow point of the upper body venous compartment. In this situation the midline incision may be extended superiorly to the left or right and the strap muscles divided to provide an unrestricted passageway for the bypass conduit. The largest of the two jugular veins may also be exposed and mobilized through a secondary cervical incision. The two incisions are joined in a tunnel beneath the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Biopsy samples of abnormal tissue surrounding the SVC are obtained.

Diameter of the inflow vein (usually left brachiocephalic or jugular) and distance from vein to right atrial appendage are measured. After mobilizing the saphenous vein, its average diameter is measured. Length of saphenous vein to be removed is determined from (1) the ratio of the desired graft diameter to the average diameter of the saphenous vein (SV),

**Figure 28-6** Spiral vein bypass of obstructed superior vena cava through a ministernotomy. Midline incision about 10 cm in length is made over upper sternum. The sternum is divided in the midline to the third intercostal space, where it is divided transversely. Ascending aorta and right atrial appendage are exposed. Simultaneous incision is made in the thigh over greater saphenous vein.

**Figure 28-5** Computed tomography of thorax showing heart with mass in right atrium. Inset shows organized thrombus removed at operation.

and (2) distance to the right atrial (RA) appendage according to the following formula (Eq. 28-1):

$$\frac{\text{Inflow vein to SV length}}{\text{SV diameter (average)}} = \frac{\text{Inflow vein diameter (mm)}}{\text{SV diameter (average)}} \cdot \frac{\text{Inflow vein to}}{\text{RA appendage length (cm)}}$$

For example, if the brachiocephalic vein diameter is 12 mm, saphenous vein diameter is 4 mm, and distance to right atrial appendage is 10 cm, then 30 cm of saphenous vein is required ( $[12/4] \cdot 10 = 30$  cm).

The required length of saphenous vein is removed and its side branches ligated. The vein is incised longitudinally through its entire length (Fig. 28-7, A). A thoracostomy tube of the same diameter as the brachiocephalic or jugular vein is selected as a stent. The opened vein graft is flattened and wrapped around the stent in spiral fashion (Fig. 28-7, B), with the endothelial surface of the vein against the stent. Continuous sutures of 7-0 polypropylene are used to join the edges of the graft (Fig. 28-7, C), forming a large conduit with the same internal diameter as the stent. There is no advantage of a larger or smaller conduit. A smaller conduit could, in theory, have a hemodynamic advantage by increasing flow velocity in the graft. However, because the graft diameter is always smaller than that of the SVC, velocity of flow through the graft is substantial, obviating need to reduce

graft diameter to less than that of the inflow vein, which could produce stasis.

After administering heparin (100 units · kg<sup>-1</sup>) intravenously, a vascular clamp is applied at the internal jugular–subclavian vein junction and the brachiocephalic vein divided, retaining as much length as possible. The distal end of the brachiocephalic vein is oversewn for secure closure (Fig. 28-8). Thrombus or any other abnormal tissue is removed from the inside of the brachiocephalic vein. The vein graft is pushed slightly off the end of the stent to allow construction of an end-to-end anastomosis to the brachiocephalic vein using continuous 7-0 polypropylene suture (Fig. 28-8, *B*). If the internal jugular vein is selected as the site for anastomosis, a partial occlusion clamp is applied at the intended outflow point and an end-to-side anastomosis performed. The stent is then removed from the graft.

When the graft must cross the thoracic inlet, an external stent is employed to prevent graft compression. M5 A short segment of an externally reinforced PTFE graft somewhat larger than the spiral vein graft is placed around the vein graft as it crosses the thoracic inlet. A curved vascular clamp is placed across the right atrial appendage, and the tip is excised. The opening in the appendage is cleared of trabeculae to ensure unrestricted blood flow. The graft is anastomosed to the appendage, using continuous 5-0 polypropylene suture

Tip of appendage is excised and all trabeculae removed, and spiral vein graft is anastomosed to it. **D**, Completed repair.

(Fig. 28-8, *C*). If the atrial appendage is not present, the graft is anastomosed to the lateral wall of the right atrium. The completed bypass graft must be oriented correctly and be the right length (Fig. 28-8, *D*). Extra length serves no advantage and runs a risk of kinking the graft or impeding blood flow.

## Direct Operation on Superior or Inferior Vena Cava

Direct operation on the SVC or IVC is performed when there is blood clot or tumor partially obstructing the lumen. Indications include removal of thrombus surrounding intraluminal catheters used for parenteral feeding, chemotherapy, or cardiac pacing. In these cases, the thrombus may adhere to the catheter or the intima of the SVC, making nonoperative removal of the mass hazardous or impossible. There may be infection associated with the foreign body or invading the thrombus. Procedures on the IVC are usually performed for renal cell carcinoma when there is a long mobile or adherent tumor mass in the IVC or right atrium extending from the renal vein that cannot be safely removed from the right atrium.

For procedures involving the SVC, a median sternotomy is made. Strategy for inserting the venous cannulae for venous return is based on location of the mass that is to be removed (see Figs. 28-4 and 28-5). If the mass is located completely within the SVC, a two-stage venous cannula is inserted through the right atrial wall and passed into the IVC. Masses that completely fill the right atrium require peripheral cannulation (femoral vein, internal jugular vein) (see "Cardiopulmonary Bypass Established by Peripheral Cannulation" in Section III of Chapter 2).

CPB is established, and the patient's body temperature is lowered to 16°C to 20°C (see "Aortic Arch Replacement" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 26). Cardioplegic solution can be administered to arrest the heart after placement of an aortic occlusion clamp. Alternatively, the procedure can be performed using hypothermic fibrillation. When the target temperature is reached, CPB is discontinued. Venous cannulae may be removed to enhance exposure.

The SVC is incised to expose the mass. Endarterectomy technique using a Freer septum elevator may be necessary to remove adherent thrombus (see Fig. 27-7 in Chapter 27). The mass is removed completely, even if a secondary incision is required, and the access incision closed. If a portion of the wall of the vena cava has been excised, the defect can be repaired using a patch of autologous or bovine pericardium to prevent caval stenosis. Air is evacuated from the right heart, CPB is resumed, and rewarming commenced (see "Rewarming" in Section IV of Chapter 2).

Masses in the IVC adjacent to the right atrium are exposed through incision in the right atrium after establishing hypothermic circulatory arrest. It is sometimes necessary to extend the incision into the IVC. The orifices of the hepatic veins should be thoroughly inspected to ensure that no residual tumor or thrombus remains.

Retroperitoneal tumors, especially renal cell carcinoma, have a tendency to spread into the venous system and in advanced stages can involve the suprahepatic IVC and right atrium. Hypothermic CPB with an interval of circulatory arrest permits safe removal of tumor and thrombus from the retrohepatic segment of the IVC as well as from the right atrium and pulmonary artery.N4 Alternative strategies include beating-heart CPB and veno-venous bypass.G6,M10,N1

# RESULTS

Long-term follow-up of a small number of patients receiving spiral saphenous vein grafts for SVC obstruction has demonstrated excellent results. SVC syndrome is immediately relieved. When operation is performed in patients with malignancies, natural history of the tumor determines outcome. Lochridge and colleagues reported that of six patients undergoing operation for malignant disease, all were relieved of SVC syndrome with no recurrence, although all died within 1 year from their malignancy.L8 Smith and Brantigan also reported successful use of a spiral vein bypass graft in the setting of bronchogenic carcinoma,S12 and Anderson and Li have used it as an interposition graft to reconstruct the SVC after resecting a leiomyosarcoma; the graft was patent on computed axial tomography 10 months postoperatively.A3

Long-term results are known when operation is performed for SVC obstruction from benign causes.D5,D8 Doty and colleagues reported on outcome of 16 such patients with mean follow-up of 10.9 years (range 1 month to 23.7 years).D9 All patients survived the operation and were discharged from the hospital. Anticoagulation with warfarin was not used after operation in any patient, but all received aspirin. Patient outcome is summarized in Table 28-2. D9 Graft patency was confirmed by Doppler ultrasound, which showed increased flow velocity over the jugular vein on the side of the bypass graft. In some cases, venography documented patency (Fig. 28-9). Patency was inferred in most cases by freedom from symptoms of SVC syndrome.

**Figure 28-9** Venography after bypass of superior vena cava (SVC) with composite spiral saphenous vein graft. **A,** Bypass graft anastomosed to left brachiocephalic vein at left jugular–subclavian vein confluence, which courses anterior to aorta to the right atrial appendage. Contrast media from bilateral arm venography opacifies right atrium and pulmonary trunk. **B,** Closer view shows bypass graft between left brachiocephalic vein and right atrial appendage. There is streaming of unopacified blood from left internal jugular vein flowing into bypass graft. *Continued*

For patients in whom graft closure was documented, SVC syndrome promptly recurred and venography showed graft closure. Three patients had graft closure within the first year after operation. One had thrombosis of the proximal brachiocephalic vein–graft anastomosis 4 days after operation, with recurrence of face and neck swelling and other signs of SVC obstruction. Graft revision was performed, and the patient remained asymptomatic nearly 13 years later. Another had recurrence of symptoms 5 months after operation for spontaneous thrombosis of the SVC; she had not been given anticoagulants and, in retrospect, probably should have been treated with warfarin after operation. Symptoms of SVC syndrome recurred, and graft closure was documented by CT scan; no further operative treatment was given. In a third patient, graft closure developed 1 year after initial operation. This patient had fibrosing mediastinitis and retroperitonitis, which subsequently obliterated both internal jugular veins, the original bypass graft, three subsequent bypass grafts, and the IVC. SVC syndrome recurred promptly each time a bypass graft occluded.

At a second operation in another institution, bilateral straight saphenous vein grafts were placed from the right and

left external jugular veins to the right atrium. These grafts provided partial symptom relief for 8 years before they also occluded. At that point a 10-mm PTFE graft was placed from the left internal jugular vein to the right atrial appendage. It occluded 3 years later, and a composite graft was constructed from common iliac vein and IVC allograft tissue. This composite graft was placed from the left internal jugular vein near the angle of the mandible and a side branch to the left external jugular vein, to the right atrium; the graft was enclosed in a 12-mm PTFE graft. Four years later, SVC syndrome recurred and the patient died shortly thereafter.

Thus, 14 of 16 patients had patent spiral saphenous vein bypass grafts for the duration of follow-up (88%; CL 73%- 96%). Once established, the spiral saphenous vein graft appears to be a permanent conduit unless invaded by continuing aggressive mediastinal or intrinsic thrombotic vascular disease. Gloviczki and colleaguesG3 reported similar excellent patency of spiral grafts at 5 years for nonmalignant venous occlusive disease, noting that bifurcated conduits tended to have occlusion of one limb. In their expanded series, cumulative 4-year patency for 20 spiral grafts was 67%.K1

Spiral vein grafts are useful in children as well as adults, as demonstrated by successful treatment of SVC obstruction secondary to intraatrial baffle obstruction for transposition of the great arteries using a bypass graft from the brachiocephalic vein to the left atrial appendage.B7 Results of direct operations to remove obstructing masses from the SVC or IVC are difficult to assess because of small individual institutional experiences. Results should be good in adult patients, with nearly all surviving operation and most relieved of SVC obstruction. In infants and children in whom venous channels are small, results will be less favorable. Berman and colleagues reported 37 patients aged 4 days to 17 years with thrombus in the SVC or right atrium from central venous catheters over a 6-year period.B4 Operations to remove the clot were performed in only 4 patients, 2 of whom died (50%; CL 18%-82%).

# INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Current recommendations for operative intervention in SVC obstruction are as follows:

- Persistent severe SVC syndrome caused by chronic SVC obstruction from benign process
- Acute SVC obstruction caused by benign or malignant processes with signs of cerebral or laryngeal edema
- Relief of life-threatening SVC syndrome during palliation of malignant process
- Failure of nonoperative treatment to resolve SVC syndrome (see "Nonoperative Treatment" later)
- Tumor or blood clot partially obstructing the SVC or IVC that is hazardous or impossible to remove without operation

Reconstruction is *contraindicated* in patients with:

- Adequate collateral circulation to provide upper-body venous decompression
- Extensive thrombosis of the SVC and its tributaries such that there is no suitable vein large enough to provide outflow from the upper body sufficient to decompress venous hypertension
- Large, bulky tumors of the anterior mediastinum
- Limited life expectancy because of advanced malignancy or associated medical disorders

#### SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

#### Femoral Vein Graft

Since the original successful bypass operations were performed in the 1950s, the femoral vein has been used as a bypass graft.B8,K1,K4,M5 Gladstone and colleagues revived the concept of using autologous femoral vein to construct a bypass graft in two patients, one with mediastinal fibrosis and the other with poorly differentiated carcinoma.G2

After median sternotomy to confirm feasibility of the bypass operation, the femoral vein is exposed from its junction with the greater saphenous vein as far distally as the adductor hiatus if necessary. Minor branches are ligated and the appropriate length of vein removed distal to the femoralsaphenous junction. Following heparinization, the femoral vein graft is interposed between the brachiocephalic vein and right atrial appendage, as described for spiral vein graft bypass. Femoral vein grafts have remained patent up to 18 months after operation, as reported by Marshall and KouchoukosM5 and Kalra and colleagues.K1 Addition of a ringed PTFE tube around the graft provided external support to prevent recurrent fibrosis in a patient who had previously undergone spiral vein bypass.M5 There has been some concern about leg edema after femoral vein removal, but published reports indicate that this is not a major problem. A potential problem with femoral bypass grafts is their fixed diameter, which may not match the inflow vein or may be too small to relieve obstruction.

#### Autologous Paneled Saphenous Vein Graft

Large-caliber venous bypass conduits can be constructed using saphenous vein in a composite or paneled manner as first reported by Benvenuto and colleagues in 1962.B3 The saphenous vein is divided into several segments, each of which is incised longitudinally. The segments are flattened, placed on a stent in a paneled or tiled manner, and sewn together to create the conduit. Both the initial report and a subsequent study by Miller and Sullivan demonstrated graft patency at 1 year.B3,M8 Scherck and colleagues reviewed 11 case reports in which autologous vein grafts were used in various configurations to bypass or reconstruct the SVC.S3 Follow-up ranged from 8 days to 5 years, and overall graft patency was 70%.

## Saphenous Vein Grafts

Intact saphenous veins can be used as bypass conduits. Their small caliber typically dictates constructing more than one graft to provide adequate venous flow. Mitchell and colleagues described two patients with mediastinal fibrosis in whom saphenous vein was used to create a double bypass graft to the proximal SVC.M9 One patient was asymptomatic 11 years postoperatively; both grafts thrombosed 2 weeks after operation in the other. Larsson and Lepore reported three patients with thymoma in whom saphenous vein was used for bypass grafting.L2 Two had double bypass graft construction to the right atrium and the third had single bypass graft construction to the proximal SVC. All patients had patent grafts at follow-up from 8 to 10 months.

Unmodified saphenous vein grafts may be too small to relieve venous obstruction unless two or more grafts are constructed from veins above the caval obstruction to the right atrium. Although patency is good, relief of symptoms may not be as predictable as when a single large-diameter graft is used.

# Alternative Venous Anastomoses

Occasionally, patients with SVC obstruction can be surgically treated without constructing a venous bypass graft in the thorax. Schramel and Olinde were the first to describe subcutaneous tunneling of a long saphenous vein bypass conduit to the jugular vein.S4 Taylor and colleagues later used a similar approach.T1 Vincze and colleagues described seven cases of patients treated with saphenous-jugular bypass for SVC obstruction caused by lung carcinoma; all were free of obstructive symptoms at the time of death, ranging from 2 to 14 months.V1 Graham and colleagues reported a series of three patients undergoing subcutaneous jugular vein–to– femoral vein bypassG5; all had relief of SVC syndrome at follow-up, ranging from 6 weeks to 13 months.

Cooley and Hallman reported a case of SVC obstruction in which contrast venography demonstrated retrograde flow through the azygos system.C4 The patient was treated with side-to-side anastomosis of the azygos vein to the IVC, which resolved the SVC obstruction. Shimokawa and colleaguesS10 described extracorporeal axillofemoral venous bypass as a useful temporizing measure to reduce venous pressure in the upper thorax.

The extensive length of bypass grafts taken from the upper-body veins to the femoral vein in the groin presents enough resistance to flow to render long-term patency of such conduits unpredictable. Simple anastomoses between veins in a high-pressure system to venous channels with normal low pressure within the thorax are unusual opportunities, but they should be sought in all cases.

## Allografts and Pericardial Conduits

In some cases, autologous venous bypass grafting cannot be accomplished. Alternative tissue conduits in this setting include aortic, SVC, or femoral vein allografts and autologous pericardial tube grafts. Aortic allografts have excellent handling characteristics and perform well when used for arterial system replacements. Scherck and colleaguesS3 demonstrated overall graft patency of nearly 90% on review of 17 patients (CL 74%-96%) who received aortic allografts to reconstruct the SVC. In 1997, Ohri and colleaguesO2 reported a case of SVC obstruction caused by drug-resistant tuberculosis and treated with aortic allograft reconstruction; the graft was patent at 6 months. Moore and colleagues examined the potential application of SVC allografts as a possible conduitM12; graft patency was approximately 70% in their experimental model. Clinical use of an SVC allograft has been reported only once to date; the graft was patent 1 year after operation.

Initial experience with tube grafts constructed from autologous pericardium has been disappointing in the experimental setting. Scherck and colleagues reviewed three series of experimental pericardial tube grafts; none were patent.S3 Clinical use of autologous pericardial tubes, however, has been more encouraging. Zembala and colleagues created a pericardial tube graft between the brachiocephalic vein and right atrial appendage that remained patent for 11 months in a patient with malignant teratoma.Z2 Piccione and colleagues successfully used autologous pericardial tube grafts in six patients to reconstruct portions of the SVC after resection for carcinoma, and all were relieved of obstructive symptoms.P3 Lemmer and colleagues created composite conduits in two pediatric patients from pedicled right atrium and pericardium to reconstruct the SVC; the conduits were patent 24 and 43 months after operation.L3

Aortic or venous allografts have high patency in many applications within the thorax. Long-term patency depends on methods of graft preparation and complex immune factors. Allografts should be viewed as palliative, and the graft should be expected to deteriorate with time. Pericardial venous conduits are probably no better than (and perhaps not as good as) prosthetic conduits. On the other hand, composite pericardial conduits consisting of pericardium and pedicled atrium should have a high probability of remaining patent for a long time because they include normal endocardium.

## Prosthetic Grafts

Prosthetic grafts, principally externally supported (ringed) polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE), have been used to bypass or replace the SVC for both benign and malignant disease.D2,K1,L4 Kalra and colleagues used ePTFE to bypass nonmalignant obstructed SVCs in 6 patients.K1 Cumulative patency at 1 and 4 years was 50% and 17%, respectively, and was significantly lower than for 20 patients who received spiral saphenous vein grafts (67% and 67%, respectively; *P* = .02).

Dartevelle and colleagues interposed ePTFE grafts between the proximal and cardiac ends of the SVC in eight patients, and between one or both brachiocephalic veins in 14 patients with malignant lung or mediastinal tumors.D2 One graft occluded early postoperatively and one at 14 months. Patency of all remaining grafts was demonstrated from 1 to 98 months (mean 23 months) postoperatively.

Leo and colleagues used ePTFE grafts to bypass the SVC in 28 patients with malignant lung or mediastinal tumors who had total SVC resection.L4 Early graft occlusion was observed in one patient. At 4 months, all grafts in surviving patients were patent.

## Nonoperative Treatment

# *Medical Therapy*

Medical measures may be beneficial in temporarily relieving symptoms of SVC syndrome, especially in hospitalized patients. Bed rest with the head elevated gradually brings improvement in most cases. Diuretics and reduced sodium intake usually reduce upper-body edema. Corticosteroids may be useful in reducing cerebral edema.C1

Anticoagulants have been frequently employed, but effectiveness has not been demonstrated by controlled trial.P1 They may be effective in preventing propagation of clot into caval tributaries, thereby retarding progression of the syndrome. Anticoagulants most frequently used include heparin during hospitalization and warfarin for long-term therapy. Long-acting heparin-like medications (enoxaparin) may prove beneficial for preventing clot propagation. Patients best suited for anticoagulant therapy are those with quiescent benign disease (e.g., dormant granulomatous mediastinitis) or catheter placement in the SVC.

Thrombolytic therapy may be valuable in patients with acute thrombosis of the SVC if the cause of thrombosis can be eliminated, such as by removing an indwelling catheter. Gray and colleagues reported the Cleveland Clinic experience using urokinase or streptokinase for treating SVC syndrome in 16 patients, 11 of whom had indwelling central venous catheters; 56% (CL 40%-71%) had complete clot lysis and relief of symptoms.G7 Success was most often achieved when thrombolytic medication was infused through the central venous catheters and when thrombus had been present less than 5 days. Reports of other cases from the literature indicate greatest success of clot lysis when the thrombosis is treated within 72 hours.

## *Radiation Therapy*

Radiation therapy is the primary treatment modality for thoracic malignancies causing SVC syndrome, and nearly all patients receive radiation at some point in their clinical course. This treatment should be administered only after establishing a tissue diagnosis of the cause of SVC obstruction, because a few patients may develop life-threatening cerebral or laryngeal edema that requires urgent intervention.S9

Radiation is directed to the tumor mass, to a 2-cm margin surrounding it, and to mediastinal, hilar, and supraclavicular lymph nodes.L6 Radiation is fractionated with an initial midplane dose of 4 Gy for 3 days and then 1.5 Gy per day until an accumulated 30 to 50 Gy is achieved. Total dose depends on the patient's condition, extent of disease, response of disease to treatment, and tumor histology.

Rodrigues and colleagues used hypofractionated radiation therapy to treat 39 patients with primary lung cancer and SVC syndrome.R5 The most successful regimen was administration of a high dose of 8 Gy weekly for 3 weeks, for a total dose of 24 Gy. Using this protocol, 96% of patients received some relief of SVC syndrome, and 56% had complete relief. Recurrence occurred within 6 months in 20% of patients.

Most patients respond to radiation treatment. Reports from the literature suggest only 10% to 20% of patients fail to obtain relief of SVC syndrome, but up to 50% relapse.N3 Improved survival has been reported with radiation therapy for patients with SVC syndrome resulting from malignancy.P2 Mean survival time for untreated persons is 6 to 7 months, whereas it is at least double that with radiation therapy, and some long-term cures have been reported. Perez and colleagues found that 10% of patients with bronchogenic carcinoma as a cause of SVC syndrome were alive at 30 months, and 45% of patients with lymphoma as a cause were alive late after treatment.P2 Emergency radiation therapy may be indicated for treating critically ill children presenting with SVC syndrome, most commonly due to non-Hodgkin lymphoma.I1

## *Chemotherapy*

Cancer chemotherapy can be effective as primary therapy or as an adjunct to radiotherapy or surgery in selected cases. Random use of chemotherapy has not been shown to be effective.L6,P1 Combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy is beneficial for relieving SVC syndrome caused by mediastinal lymphoma. Chemotherapy alone, using a combination of agents, may be the treatment of choice for small-cell anaplastic bronchogenic carcinoma, with symptom relief within 7 days.K3,S5 Best results occur with incomplete SVC obstruction and with extrinsic compression from large tumors at the thoracic inlet.

## *Transluminal Balloon Angioplasty and Stents*

Successful transluminal balloon angioplasty and stenting require that the SVC not be completely obstructed, because a vascular passageway is needed to guide the device.S7 Endovascular therapy initially involved balloon angioplasty, which was successful for benign causes of SVC obstruction but rarely for malignant causes. However, the SVC is unable to resist external compression by tumor or inflammation. This led to the use of intravascular stents.G1

Gaines and colleagues used the Gianturco Z self-expanding metallic device (consisting of a stainless steel wire bent in Z configuration) as a single or double stent in 20 patients with malignant SVC obstruction; 13 (65%; CL 51%-77%) were free of SVC obstruction until death, and 3 required a second intervention.G1 Oudkerk and colleagues treated 22 patients with malignant obstructions with Gianturco Z stents, with 68% (CL 55%-79%) free of symptoms of SVC syndrome and without recurrence until death from tumor progression. Another 4 (18%) showed improvement, and 3 (14%) had reocclusion.O6 Dyet and colleagues achieved similar results using the Wallstent endovascular prosthesis in 17 patients.D11 This device is a tube of woven stainless steel mesh, which is more secure for short-segment stenoses.

Stents have also been successfully used to treat benign causes of SVC obstruction, including stenosis caused by pacemaker electrodes.F1,L7 Subsequent series have confirmed the effectiveness of endovascular stenting for both benign and malignant SVC obstruction.C1,K1,L1,N2,R3,S2 It is now considered the first line of treatment in many institutions.L1,R3,S2

Because of clot formation in patients with SVC obstruction, concomitant thrombolytic therapy has been recommended to remove the clot and establish a channel through which the stent can be deployed.J1 Anticoagulation is recommended after stent implantation to avoid thrombosis, but optimal duration and methods of anticoagulation have not been completely defined.N2

In addition to early thrombosis, complications of endovascular stenting include acute pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, perforation, cardiac tamponade, stent migration, infection, cardiac dysrhythmias, and pulmonary embolism.N2,R3

## *Comparison of Operation with Catheter Intervention*

Wisselink and colleagues compared operative vs. percutaneous catheter intervention for treating patients with central venous obstruction.W2 Their study included patients with obstruction of not only the SVC but also its major tributaries. Of 27 patients, 12 underwent operation, 14 had angioplasty, and 1 had both. Stents were used in three patients. Primary symptom relief at 1 year was achieved in 88% of the surgical group vs. 36% of the angioplasty group (*P* < .05). When repeat angioplasty was performed, success in that group increased to 66%. Thus, surgical success exceeded that of single catheter intervention, but repeated angioplasty achieved comparable results.

A nonrandomized trial comparing open surgical repair with endovascular stenting has demonstrated equivalent midterm effectiveness in terms of symptom relief.R3 Reinterventions were required more frequently in the stented patients. Assisted primary and secondary patency was significantly higher in the stented patients (*P* = .02). The authors concluded that open surgical repair remains an excellent option for patients who are unsuitable for endovascular stents.

#### Injury to Left Brachiocephalic Vein during Sternotomy

Laceration of the left brachiocephalic vein is a hazard of sternotomy. It occurs rarely during primary sternotomy, but is a common threat during repeat sternotomy. The hazard is reduced during reentry by dividing the sternum with an oscillating saw rather than using the standard blade. Once the sternum is divided, tissues adherent to the posterior table of the sternum superiorly are separated sharply or with the electrocautery. Mobilizing the tissues surrounding the brachiocephalic vein will reduce the role of disruption. Wide separation of the sternal edges should be avoided to reduce tension on the vein.

The most common method of managing major injuries is ligation. Usually, left arm or neck swelling is not observed, although later thrombosis of the tributaries of the vein may occur. The consequences of uncontrolled hemorrhage and difficulties in repairing the vein without creating stenosis appear to outweigh the risks of ligation. Repair of the vein is feasible if the disruption is not complete, and can be accomplished using autologous or bovine pericardium. If the vein is disrupted at its junction with the SVC such that ligation will compromise flow into the SVC or cause stenosis of the right brachiocephalic vein, repair or SVC bypass should be performed to avoid SVC syndrome.

#### Budd-Chiari Syndrome

In 1845, Budd described three cases of hepatic vein thrombosis caused by abscess-induced phlebitis.B9 In 1899, Chiari reported another three cases of obliterative phlebitis of large hepatic veins.C2 *Budd-Chiari syndrome* was thus initially defined as symptomatic occlusion of hepatic veins, but subsequent inclusion of various obliterative changes in the hepatic portion of the IVC and hepatic vein orifices broadened the definition. Membranous obstruction of the IVC is generally regarded as a congenital vascular malformation, yet it results in impaired hepatic venous outflow blockage and hence is included with the syndrome. However, obliterative disease of this type and primary hepatic vein thrombosis (classic Budd-Chiari), are different clinical entities.O3

Hepatic vein thrombosis is more common in western than eastern countries and presents as severe, sometimes acute, hepatic failure. It is associated with a hypercoagulable state, the *factor V Leiden mutation*. B6,D3,M3 Mahmoud and Elias recommend screening all patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome for activated protein C resistance and factor V Leiden mutation.M2 Vasculitis accompanying *Behçet disease* is also associated with hepatic vein thrombosis.B2 When there is associated thrombosis of the portal venous system, treatment options are limited and prognosis is poor, with 70% of patients dying before any treatment can be given or after operation.M4

Treatment of classic Budd-Chiari syndrome is primarily by orthotopic liver transplantation when liver failure is fulminant or chronic.P4 For acute and subacute forms when hepatic injury is reversible, a surgical or percutaneous portasystemic shunt is effective.O1,P4,R6,S15 A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) may also be effective while awaiting liver transplantation.

*Obliterative disease* of the hepatic portion of the IVC is often a *membranous obstruction* of the vena cava or of the hepatic vein orifices. It is primarily a condition found in Nepal, South Africa, China, and India.O3 It is usually idiopathic, although many consider it to be a congenital anomaly. Complex congenital venous anomalies may cause hepatic venous congestion in rare instances.S1 Clinical presentation is milder than with primary hepatic vein thrombosis, and time of onset is frequently unknown. Enlarged subcutaneous veins over the body trunk are characteristic, similar to those seen in obstruction of the SVC. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a frequent complication.

Treatment is generally by transvenous balloon angioplasty or stent placement, possibly in combination with a portasystemic shunt.B1,B5,O4,W3,Y1 Despite these less invasive treatment methods, operative intervention has a role in this condition. Transatrial membranotomy, reconstruction of the IVC, and bypass from the IVC to the right atrium are alternatives when catheter interventions are not possible.Z1

Koja and colleagues describe direct exposure of the retrohepatic IVC via thoracoabdominal incision on the right.K5 The vena cava is occluded above and below the liver while the patient is on femorofemoral bypass with an oxygenator (see "Cardiopulmonary Bypass Established by Peripheral Cannulation" in Section III of Chapter 2). The vena cava is opened longitudinally and an open endvenectomy is performed, removing organized thrombus from the vena cava and hepatic veins (similar to thromboendarterectomy for chronic pulmonary embolism; see Fig. 27-7 in Chapter 27). As hepatic veins are opened, blood is returned to the bypass circuit so that no clamps are required on the hepatic veins.

The authors reported a remarkable series of 29 patients treated between 1979 and 1997. All patients survived operation and had documented IVC patency at 1 to 2 months after surgery. Restenosis of the IVC developed in 2 patients 2 and 6 years after operation; both were successfully treated by either reoperation or balloon angioplasty. Hepatoma occurred 3 to 9 years after operation in 5 patients. Survival at 1, 5, and 10 years after operation was 100%, 94%, and 67%, respectively. Esophageal varices gradually resolve, and hepatic fibrosis improves histologically after this operation.K6 Rarely, hepatic trauma with intraparenchymal or subcapsular hematoma may cause compression of the intrahepatic IVC, resulting in Budd-Chiari syndrome.M13 Technical problems related to closure of atrial septal defect may also cause obstruction of the IVC and hepatic veins.D4
