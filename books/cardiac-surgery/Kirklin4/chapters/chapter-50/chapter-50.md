## DEFINITION

Congenital mitral valve disease is a developmental malformation of one or more of the components of the mitral valve apparatus, including that portion of left atrial wall immediately adjacent to the mitral anulus that produces stenosis or regurgitation or, occasionally, a combined lesion. It often coexists with other cardiac anomalies, particularly those involving the left-sided cardiac chambers and aorta.

Left atrioventricular valve (AV) anomalies associated with AV septal defects (see Chapter 34), aortic atresia and other forms of hypoplastic left heart physiology (see Chapter 49), various forms of AV discordant connection (see Chapter 55), or transposition of the great arteries (see Chapter 52) are special situations discussed in the chapters describing these conditions. Mitral valve anomalies associated with straddling or univentricular AV connections are described in Chapters 35 and 56, respectively. Regurgitation from mitral valve prolapse as part of the syndrome of myxomatous degeneration is described in Chapter 11.

#### HISTORICAL NOTE

Heterogeneity of congenital mitral valve disease and frequency of its association with other cardiac anomalies make it difficult to trace the historical evolution of knowledge about this entity. However, as early as 1902, Fisher described two cases of congenital disease of the left side of the heart, one of which was a stenotic supravalvar ring.F1 Parachute mitral valve, another entity in this spectrum, was not described until 1961 and was not fully documented until 1963.S2,S6

One of the first reports of surgical treatment of congenital mitral valve disease was that by Starkey in 1959.S10 In 1962, Creech and colleagues reported repairing congenital mitral regurgitation resulting from a cleft in the posterior leaflet in a 2-year-old girl. Although the child's condition was improved by suturing the cleft, moderate mitral regurgitation persisted.C10

## MORPHOLOGY

The congenital anomaly may involve any component of the mitral apparatus and may result in stenosis with or without regurgitation or in pure regurgitation. Although only one component may be involved, more often the entire valve is affected.C2

*Congenital mitral stenosis* without or with regurgitation may result from supravalvar, anular, or valvar narrowing and may be accentuated by subvalvar obstruction produced by hypertrophied and misplaced papillary muscles or sheets of fused chordae.C3 Frequently, stenosis is a result of abnormalities at multiple levels. Although embryologic origins of these complex anomalies are poorly understood, recent studies suggest that abnormal development of a transient left ventricular (LV) structure, a horseshoe-shaped ventricular myocardial ridge, results in various obstructive mitral valve lesions, including parachute mitral valve and formation of asymmetric mitral valves.O1

*Congenital mitral regurgitation* may result from anular dilatation secondary to anterior or posterior leaflet prolapse or to posterior leaflet hypoplasia with chordal shortening. Chordal elongation and valve prolapse may be so severe that chordal rupture can develop even in young children, producing severe regurgitation. Congenital mitral regurgitation may also be produced by clefts, gaps, or perforations in the anterior mitral leaflet, by accessory commissures, or by leaflet hypoplasia at medial or lateral commissures.

## Supravalvar Ring

A tough fibrous ring may be situated just on the left atrial side of the mitral anulus.A4 The pulmonary veins and left atrial appendage enter the left atrium above (proximal to) the ring, in contrast to the situation in cor triatriatum (see Chapter 32). The supravalvar ring may be nonobstructive and an incidental finding, or it may protrude into the orifice, producing a variable degree of obstruction.A4,D2 A ring may also occur on the left atrial aspect of the mitral valve leaflets that, when circumferential, prevents their adequate opening, causing obstruction. This lesion may be particularly difficult to identify echocardiographically.

A supravalvar ring is an isolated lesion in about half the cases in which it contributes importantly to death in the first year of lifeD2,S14 (Fig. 50-1). In the other half, it coexists with other cardiac anomalies, particularly with other mitral valve anomalies and with LV outflow tract obstruction.S6

## Mitral Anulus

The mitral anulus uncommonly is small and obstructive in the absence of severe LV hypoplasia or other valvar abnormalities.C8 It may be small but not obviously obstructive, particularly in hearts with coarctation of the aorta.R2 The anulus may be enlarged, usually secondary to mitral regurgitation resulting from some other deformity of the valve. However, the basic valvar anomaly leading to regurgitation may be subtle and difficult to identify. Carpentier and colleagues found essentially isolated anular dilatation in 8 (17%) of 47 cases with congenital mitral valve disease, although

some deficiency of commissural tissue is implied by their description.C3

#### Leaflet Anomalies

The orifice through the mitral valve is frequently narrowed by congenital absence of one or both commissures, which are replaced by a continuous sheet of leaflet tissue. Small perforations may be present at what is usually a commissure (Fig. 50-2). The leaflets often then take the form of an inverted

All components of valve are abnormal and contribute to stenosis. **A,** Viewed from left ventricle (LV) with mitral valve *(MV)* essentially intact. Leaflets are diffusely thickened without commissures, papillary muscles are bulky and almost reach the leaflets, and chordae are thick, fused, and short. **B,** Viewed from LV with mitral anulus divided. **C,** Viewed from left atrium. It is not possible to distinguish anterior from posterior leaflet except by their attachments to anulus. Key: *A,* Anterior mitral leaflet; *ALP,* anterolateral papillary muscle; *AoV,* aortic valve; *LA,* left atrium; *LAA,* left atrial appendage; *LV,* left ventricle; *P,* posterior mitral leaflet; *PMP,* posteromedial papillary muscle; *S,* muscular interventricular septum.

cone; in this circumstance, chordae are usually short and intermixed and the orifice further obstructed by abnormal and hypertrophied papillary muscles beneath it (the so-called hammock valve).C4 In other cases, there may be congenital leaflet thickening and immobility and consequent orifice narrowing, even though commissures are present (Fig. 50-3).

When congenital mitral regurgitation without important stenosis is the functional lesion, a variety of mitral leaflet anomalies may be responsible. The posterior leaflet may be severely hypoplastic and represented only by tags of fibrous tissue.C3 In other cases, the anterior leaflet may be long and billowing and the chordae thin, elongated, and occasionally ruptured.D2,F3 This has been observed as a cause of severe mitral regurgitation in patients as young as age 2 years. It may represent prolapse or myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve appearing in the very young (see "Mitral Valve Prolapse" under Morphology in Section I of Chapter 11).

Without any stigmata of an AV septal defect, the anterior leaflet or, less commonly, the posterior leaflet may be separated into two leaflets by an accessory commissure or a cleft, with resultant regurgitation through that area.C10,D4,W1 The abnormality is considered an accessory commissure if there are chordae tendineae associated with it, and a cleft if there are none. Chordae tendineae may pass from the edges of an accessory commissure to ventricular septum or rudimentary papillary muscles (as was the case in two of five cases reported by Carpentier and colleaguesC3), or the cleft may simply represent leaflet deficiency in that area (Fig. 50-4) without chordal support.B4,F3 Rarely, there may be a hole in the anterior leaflet.F3

Commissural leaflet tissue may be absent at one or the other commissure, resulting in an accessory orifice and mitral regurgitation.S3

#### Chordal Anomalies

Short chordae (often thick and fused) or complete chordal absence bring leaflet tissue down onto the papillary muscles and result in a narrow orifice (Fig. 50-5). Complete absence of chordal development is common in congenital mitral stenosis.C7 Accessory chordae that attach along the entire free edge of the anterior leaflet rather than leaving its central third free are a cause of restricted leaflet motion and, therefore, stenosis.R2

Chordal abnormalities can also result in congenital mitral regurgitation. The most common is chordal elongation,

sometimes with lengthened papillary muscles, the tips of which prolapse along with the leaflet into the left atrium during ventricular systole.C3

#### Papillary Muscle Anomalies

There may be a single large papillary muscle with all chordae attaching to it, the so-called parachute valve described first by Schiebler and colleagues and emphasized by Shone and colleaguesS2,S6 (Figs. 50-6 and 50-7). Usually the chordae are short and thick and limit leaflet movement. This restricts the primary orifice through the opened valve as well as secondary orifices between chordae, resulting in mitral stenosis. In other cases, there is a single large papillary muscle, and near it is a hypoplastic one with only a few chordae attached; the valve orifice is narrowed by the same mechanisms. A parachute valve usually produces only severe stenosis, but it may also produce mitral regurgitation.G3

Two hypertrophied and abnormally placed contiguous papillary muscles, usually situated posteriorly, are also a cause of subvalvar obstruction.C3,C4,D2 Obstruction is often further aggravated by coexistence of short, thick chordae and anomalous thick muscular bands.R5 In other cases, there are three or more closely placed and hypoplastic or bulky papillary muscles, a situation in which short, thick chordae are often also present and contribute to stenosis. In all these cases, absence of the normal wide interpapillary distance contributes to obstruction in the mitral pathway.

An anomalous papillary muscle arcade (mitral arcade) formed by a bridge of fibrous tissue running through the free aspect of the anterior mitral leaflet, between the anterolateral and posteromedial papillary muscles, may produce mitral regurgitationD2,L3 (Fig. 50-8).

## Coexisting Cardiac Anomalies

Patients with congenital mitral regurgitation often have coexisting cardiac anomalies, but they tend to be less severe than in congenital mitral stenosis (Table 50-1).

Congenital mitral stenosis is rarely an isolated malformation. In about 30% of cases, it coexists with ventricular septal defect (VSD). In more than 50%, it coexists with one or

another form of LV outflow obstruction, a situation termed *Shone syndrome*. S6 This may consist only of coarctation or some hypoplasia of the distal aortic arch, with or without patent ductus arteriosus (Table 50-2). LV outflow tract obstruction may be valvar, discrete subvalvar, or combined valvar and subvalvar aortic stenosis, with or without coarctation. Rarely, there is diffuse tunnel subvalvar stenosis, with or without the other forms of LV outflow tract obstruction. The aortic valve may be bicuspid. Frequency of association of LV outflow tract obstruction with congenital mitral valve disease is evidenced by Rosenquist's finding of 31 instances of coexisting important congenital mitral valve anomalies among autopsy specimens from 53 patients whose primary diagnosis in life was coarctation of the aorta.R2 However, when a large surgical series of coarctation repair is considered that includes adults as well as infants and children, only 2%

of patients demonstrate congenital mitral valve disease.F3 All of this supports considering congenital mitral valve disease as an important component in the entity known as *hypoplastic left heart physiology* (see Chapter 49).

Rare coexistence of a stenosing supravalvar ring with tetralogy of Fallot is noteworthy because, if undetected, it may cause death after tetralogy repair.B3,C8 Congenital mitral valve disease and subaortic stenosis may rarely coexist with subpulmonary stenosis and intact ventricular septum, subpulmonary stenosis and VSD, or valvar pulmonary stenosis.B5,G3

# CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

#### Symptoms and Signs

#### *Isolated Mitral Valve Disease*

Symptoms and clinical signs are identical to those of acquired mitral valve disease, the congenital etiology being apparent only when presentation is in infancy or early childhood and there is no rheumatic history (see Clinical Features and Diagnostic Criteria in Section I of Chapter 11). Symptoms of pulmonary venous hypertension include dyspnea, orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and recurrent pulmonary infection.C8 Pulmonary hypertension is usually present in severe lesions, terminating in heart failure, often with peripheral and central cyanosis.C8

Mitral stenosis is associated with a prominent apical middiastolic murmur, sometimes with presystolic accentuation, and there may be an opening snap, although the morphologic features commonly resulting in limitation of leaflet movement make this less common than in acquired mitral stenosis.A4,D1 Mitral regurgitation is evidenced by an apical pansystolic murmur radiating to the axilla, frequently with a third heart sound or a short mid-diastolic murmur and LV overactivity. When there is pulmonary hypertension, the second heart sound is accentuated and there is a right ventricular lift.

## *Mitral Valve Disease and Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction*

Unless a VSD or patent ductus arteriosus is also present, the mitral signs are usually clinically diagnostic, particularly when the only additional important site of obstruction is a coarctation. When there is severe congenital aortic stenosis, the mitral lesion, unless also severe, may not be clinically obvious, although it worsens the clinical presentation.

## Electrocardiography

Electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of left atrial hypertrophy of greater degree than is usually found in the coexisting cardiac anomaly suggests associated congenital mitral valve disease. Right ventricular hypertrophy is evident on the ECG when there is the usual raised pulmonary vascular resistance and right atrial enlargement, whereas LV hypertrophy is evident on the ECG when there is severe mitral regurgitation or associated LV outflow tract obstruction. Atrial fibrillation is rare.

## Chest Radiography

Left atrial enlargement out of proportion to that usually present in any coexisting cardiac anomaly is the most important clue in the chest radiograph of the possible presence of congenital mitral valve disease. There is cardiac enlargement regardless of whether the disease is isolated or complex. Signs of pulmonary venous hypertension and occasionally overt pulmonary edema may be present in severe cases, but pulmonary plethora from a coexisting left-to-right shunt may obscure these signs.

## Two-Dimensional Echocardiography

Two-dimensional echocardiography combined with Doppler interrogation can provide a complete analysis of the morphology and function of congenitally abnormal mitral valvesD3,G4,S8,S9,T4,V2 (Fig. 50-9, *A-F*). However, diagnosis by echocardiography of some forms of congenital mitral valve disease, especially supravalvar ring and double orifice mitral valve, requires considerable care and can easily be missed.S5,S14 Three-dimensional echocardiography can provide important morphologic details that may not be visible with standard imaging (see Fig. 50-2).

## Cardiac Catheterization and Cineangiographic Studies

Cardiac catheterization and cineangiographic studies are often performed to evaluate possible associated lesions and define the degree of pulmonary vascular disease.C2 Morphology of the congenitally abnormal valve can be further evaluated by its cineangiographic appearance.M1

## Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging

Computed tomography (CT) plays a limited role in evaluating the congenitally abnormal mitral valve, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide important morphologic information that may supplement that provided by echocardiography (see Figs. 50-5 and 50-7). In addition, MRI can provide functional information such as quantification of mitral regurgitant fraction and valve area in diastole (Fig. 50-10).

# NATURAL HISTORY

Congenital mitral valve disease is a rare congenital cardiac anomaly, occurring in 0.6% of autopsied patients with congenital heart disease and 0.21% to 0.42% of clinical cases of congenital heart disease.C8

Natural history is highly variable and depends most importantly on severity of resultant stenosis or regurgitation and on type and severity of coexisting lesions, rather than on the particular morphologic mitral valve lesion itself. For example,

Key: *LV,* Left ventricle. **Figure 50-9, cont'd**

in one study, *parachute mitral valve* was associated with 95% freedom from mitral valve surgery at 6 months and 80% freedom at 10 years.S1 However, associated cardiac defects were present in essentially all cases, particularly LV outflow tract abnormalities, atrial septal defect, VSD, coarctation, and hypoplastic LV; these strongly influence natural history. In another study, only 4% of patients with parachute mitral valve required a procedure on the valve, with intervention dominated by associated cardiac anomalies.M2 Parachute mitral valve presenting in the adult is rare but does occur and is more likely to be an isolated anomaly than when diagnosed in infants and children. Nine patients have been identified in the literature over the past 50 years; three were asymptomatic without important hemodynamic abnormalities, three presented with stenosis, and three with regurgitation.H1

Isolated *congenital mitral stenosis* usually is severe and often produces symptoms and death if untreated during the first 4 to 5 years of life.C8,V1 When congenital mitral stenosis coexists with other important cardiac anomalies, symptoms occur even earlier. When it is associated with other components of hypoplastic left heart physiology, severe symptoms often develop during the first year of life.

Isolated *congenital mitral regurgitation* is often only moderate in severity in early life, and about half the patients with it do not show development of important symptoms. Symptoms and need for intervention usually come earlier when it coexists with other important cardiac anomalies.

#### TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

The overall approach to the neonate, infant, and young child is different from that for older patients. Preservation of the native valve is of paramount importance, even if it means accepting residual valve disease that might otherwise not be considered acceptable in a fully grown patient. The valve must be carefully studied preoperatively and at operation, seeking ways in which it can be repaired rather than replaced.

a fallback option, should generally be avoided. Some techniques used for congenital mitral valve disease are the same as those used for older patients with acquired disease, and these are described for both mitral stenosis and regurgitation under Technique of Operation in Section I of Chapter 11. However, many techniques are specific for congenital abnormalities such as supramitral ring (Fig. 50-11), mitral arcade (Fig. 50-12), and single papillary muscle (Fig. 50-13).C5 In general, repair is possible in 50% to 80% of patients.C7,S11 Additional comments specific to *congenital* mitral valve disease follow.

#### Repair of Congenital Mitral Stenosis

When the valve leaflets are fused into one and are stenotic, leaflet incisions may be made in the areas in which commissures would be expected to have developed. Consideration is given to inserting polyester or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) chordae (see "Repair of Chordae" later in this chapter). At times, fused papillary muscles or chordae may be split or partly excised in an attempt to enlarge the orifice (see Fig. 11-7 in Chapter 11).

Because these maneuvers may result in regurgitation, immediately after discontinuing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), a regurgitant mitral jet may first be detected by palpating the posterior left atrial wall and then the superior left atrial wall beneath the aorta. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is invaluable at this stage in determining that mitral valve function is sufficiently good to avoid valve replacement. If TEE documents important regurgitation accompanied by high left atrial pressure and a suboptimal hemodynamic state, CPB is reestablished and the valve repaired further or replaced; otherwise, early and late results are unsatisfactory. If hemodynamics are acceptable but regurgitation is moderate to severe, the decision to replace the valve is complex. Importantly, the smaller the patient and mitral anulus, the more likely will be the tendency to

A supramitral ring (SMR) is present on mitral valve. **B,** Close-up cutaway view of mitral valve and anulus showing SMR. Ring can be cut away circumferentially using sharp dissection as shown here, but in some cases, it can be peeled away bluntly once the plane between underlying endocardium and ring tissue is established. Ring may be discrete (as shown here) but may also extend to a variable degree onto mitral leaflets, sometimes extending across length of leaflet onto chordal structures, causing thickening, contraction, and immobility. In this case, using both sharp and blunt dissection, as much of the abnormal tissue as possible is removed from leaflet without damaging underlying leaflet tissue. (From Chauvaud.C5)

accept the result, recognizing that this will be a temporary solution.

#### Repair of Congenital Mitral Regurgitation

The mitral valve is carefully examined with the possible pathologic bases for congenital mitral regurgitation clearly in mind, because these determine the most appropriate type of operation. Repair based on pathology is performed whenever possible. Specific maneuvers include anuloplasty, repair of cleft leaflet, various forms of chordal repair including shortening, lengthening, and resuspension of ruptured chords, partial leaflet resection, chordal replacement, and partial commissural closure (see Technique of Operation in Section I of Chapter 11).

#### *Anuloplasty*

Occasionally, anular dilatation is the dominant pathology even in young children, but it is usually associated with some abnormal thickening and prolapse of a billowing anterior leaflet.L4 If a reasonable anterior leaflet without ruptured chordae is present, anuloplasty is indicated. Anuloplasty is also appropriate when there is marked hypoplasia or near absence of the posterior leaflet, which probably initially was responsible for the regurgitation and subsequent anular

(From Chauvaud.C5)

dilatation. Following anuloplasty, the mitral valve is essentially converted to a monoleaflet valve.

Although use of an anuloplasty ring is optimal in adults, it is not used in infants and children because it precludes growth of the anulus. Thus, a technique such as the Reed asymmetric measured anuloplasty is chosen (see Fig. 11-15 in Chapter 11).

# *Repair of Chordae*

When regurgitation is caused by ruptured chordae to less than half the posterior leaflet, a rectangular excision and leaflet repair, usually combined with anuloplasty, may be indicated (see Figs. 11-9 and 11-10 in Chapter 11). A result similar to that obtained with rectangular excision can be achieved by simply folding the unsupported component of the leaflet on itself and securing the folds with sutures, rather than excising the leaflet tissue. If the repair attempt is unsuccessful, the folded leaflet tissue can be taken down or unfolded, allowing further valve-sparing reparative maneuvers to be attempted.

A sliding plasty has been used by Carpentier and colleagues to correct congenital elongation of chordae to part of a papillary muscle.C3 The papillary muscle is incised longitudinally and reconstructed by suturing the halves together asymmetrically, with the part attached to the elongated chordae fixed at a lower level. Elongation of all chordae to a papillary muscle may be treated by chordal shorteningC3 (Fig. 50-14). The extremity of the papillary muscle is incised longitudinally, redundant chordae buried in the trench thus created, and the papillary muscle closed firmly around them by sutures. In these situations, placement of polyester or PTFE chordae can also be useful (see "Repair of Mitral Regurgitation" under Technique of Operation in Section I of Chapter 11).

Chordal repair often involves splitting or separating papillary muscles as well as leaflet commissures. An approach through the LV apex has been described but is not recommended.B1 Use of artificial chordae for mitral valve reconstruction in children has been described; expanded PTFE sutures are employed in the technique, and early and midterm results have been encouraging.A1,M4,M9

## *Repair of Cleft Mitral Leaflet*

When sufficient anterior or posterior mitral leaflet tissue is present on both sides of a cleft leaflet, the cleft is sutured closed with interrupted simple sutures to achieve

![](_page_9_Figure_12.jpeg)

**Figure 50-15** Repair of mitral valve cleft. **A,** Cleft is identified over its full extent, with its central limit defined by the first chordal attachments on the leaflet normal edge. A simple suture is placed precisely at this point to appropriately align cleft. **B,** Simple sutures are placed to close remainder of cleft. **C,** If leaflet deficiency is present (as shown here), a patch is used. **D,** Patch has been secured in place using multiple interrupted sutures, again paying close attention to alignment of edges. (From Chauvaud.C5)

competence. If there is insufficient leaflet tissue, the cleft closure can be augmented with a patch (Fig. 50-15). A posteromedial (Wooler type) anuloplasty using interrupted simple sutures of monofilament nonabsorbable material, or a Reed anuloplasty, may be helpful.

#### Mitral Valve Replacement

When repair is not possible, mitral valve replacement is performed (see "Mitral Valve Replacement" under Technique of Operation in Section I of Chapter 11). Stent-mounted glutaraldehyde-preserved porcine xenografts are not appropriate in infants and children because of their rapid degeneration and bulk (see "Reoperation," later). The favorable orifice-to-anulus ratio of the St. Jude Medical valve (see "Choice of Device for Valve Replacement" under Indications for Operation, Selection of Technique, and Choice of Device in Section I of Chapter 11) makes it and similar mitral replacement devices the valves of choice in infants and children. A 15-mm-diameter St. Jude Medical valve is available by special order; it can provide a critical advantage in small infants in whom the prosthesis must usually be seated in a supraanular position in the left atrium, immediately downstream from the orifices of the left pulmonary veins.K2

## SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

The usual practices and protocols are used (see Chapter 5). Patients, even infants, who receive mitral valve replacement with prosthetic valves are maintained on anticoagulation with warfarin using the same general protocols as in adults (see "Special Features of Postoperative Care" in Section I of Chapter 11). Small valves in infants may be prone to dysfunction, either because of thrombosis or leaflet immobility caused by adjacent tissue at or near the small anulus. Placing a left atrial pressure catheter at the time of operation is mandatory, and using intraoperative and postoperative echocardiography to document normal movement of both valve leaflets is important in managing these patients.

#### RESULTS

## Survival

## *Early (Hospital) Death*

In the past, early mortality after operation for mitral valve disease in the pediatric age range was highly variable, ranging between 1% and 50%.B7,C3,K3,S8,V1 In most reports after 1990, mitral valve surgery in infants and children has a consistently low mortality (0%-10%) for both repair and replacementA1,B1,C6,H3,H4,M4,M6,O2,S12,S13,U1,Y2 (Table 50-3).

Despite these encouraging reports, the role of patient selection in determining early outcome remains unclear in these complex anomalies. In a series of 31 severely symptomatic patients with mitral stenosis requiring intervention within the first 2 years of life, 18 underwent balloon dilatation and 13 surgical intervention. Early mortality for the surgical patients was 31% (CL 16%-49%).M8 In a series of seven patients presenting within the first year of life with mitral regurgitation, four required surgical intervention, and three were managed medically. Two of the four surgical patients died in hospital; both required urgent operation. The two survivors underwent elective operation.G1 Yet, in another study of 17 patients presenting with mitral regurgitation, mitral valve repair was performed in all, and there was no early or late mortality. Mean age was 11 months, with 10 patients younger than age 1 year and 15 in heart failure (3 of whom required preoperative mechanical ventilation).H4

#### *Time-Related Survival*

In the early surgical era, only about 50% of patients receiving valve repair or replacement for congenital mitral valve disease were alive 10 years later. Many deaths were related to coexisting cardiac anomalies and reoperation. Current results are better.Z1 In reports after 1990, 5- and 10-year survival appears to be between 80% and 100%A1,C6,H3,H4,M4,M6,O2,S13,U1,Y2 (Table 50-4). Notably, there has been little or no further improvement in late survival during the last 2 decades.

#### Incremental Risk Factors for Premature Death

Incremental risk factors have been identified in many individual series, but there is little consistency among studies, other than young age, era of surgery, and coexisting cardiac anomalies—all of which appear in multiple analyses. In the analysis of 79 children undergoing mitral valve repair by Aharon and colleagues, no incremental risk factors for early or late death could be identified.A1 Chauvaud and colleagues in their series of 145 patients undergoing mitral valve repair for regurgitation did not find mitral valve anatomic classification to be an incremental risk factor for early death.C6 Stellin and colleagues, in a 36-year series of 93 patients undergoing mitral valve repair, identified parachute mitral valve as a risk for early mortality.S12 Prifti and colleagues identified cardiothoracic ratio > 0.6 and hammock valve morphology as risk factors.P1

Caldarone and colleagues, reporting a multicenter study of 139 patients undergoing valve replacement, identified oversized valves relative to patient size as a risk factor, as did Alsoufi and colleagues.A3,C1 In valve replacement series, supraanular placement was identified as a risk factor, as was lower body weight and longer CPB time.K4,S4

# *Era*

As knowledge about techniques of mitral repair has increased (see "Repair of Mitral Regurgitation" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 11), and as it has been realized that bioprostheses should not be used in young patients, who tolerate mechanical prosthesis and anticoagulation well, results have improved considerably.A2,B1,C6,C7,H3,M4,M9,U1,Y2

#### *Coexisting Cardiac Anomalies*

Hypoplastic left heart class has a large influence on survival. However, Bolling and colleagues report no deaths (0%; CL 0%-6%) among 30 patients undergoing their first operation for Shone syndrome, although among 17 undergoing a second operation, 4 (24%; CL 12%-39%) died.B6 Prifti and colleagues report that associated cardiac anomalies are a risk for both reoperation and midterm death after valve repair.P1

Schaverien and colleagues and Marino and colleagues both report that associated cardiac anomalies are a risk factor for death in patients with parachute mitral valve, even when no surgical procedure on the valve itself is performed.M2,S1 Caldarone and colleagues, reporting a multicenter study of 139 patients undergoing valve replacement, identified AV septal defect and Shone's complex as risk factors.C1 Selamet Tierney and colleagues, in a series of valve replacements, identified AV septal defect and, as a surrogate for additional anomalies, additional surgical procedures as risk factors.S4 Alexiou and colleagues identified AV septal defect as a risk after replacement.A2

## *Preoperative Functional Class*

Patients in higher New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes are at a considerably greater risk of dying after operation, particularly early postoperatively (Table 50-5). Preoperative cardiothoracic ratio > 0.6 has also been identified as a risk for midterm death after valve repair. This is likely a surrogate for lower functional class.P1

#### *Age*

A number of studies identify younger age as a risk factor for death after either valve repair or replacement.S12 Most studies categorize age groups into younger than 2 years or younger than 1 year. Age younger than 2 years was identified as a risk in one study involving predominantly surgical repair and balloon valvotomy.M6 Age younger than 2 has also been identified as a risk factor following mitral valve replacement.A3,B2 Prifti and colleagues and Selamet Tierney and colleagues identified age younger than 1 year as a risk for death after repair,P1,S4 and Alexiou and colleagues identified age younger than 5 years as a risk factor after mechanical valve replacement.A2

#### *Mitral Regurgitation versus Stenosis; Repair versus Replacement*

Neither of these factors can be definitively related to the probability of death early or late postoperatively.A1,B1,C7,H3,M4,U1,Y2

**Figure 50-16** Survival after operation for mitral valve regurgitation in children, stratified by type of operation. Patient cohort in replacement group is small. Numbers along horizontal axis are patients at risk. (From Chauvaud and colleagues. <sup>C6</sup>)

However, outcome is particularly good in patients with mitral stenosis due to a supravalvar ring. §14

There is conflicting evidence regarding whether survival is worse after mitral valve replacement than after repair; furthermore, the evidence that can be cited to address this question is indirect. This is understandable for several reasons. First, there are no reports randomizing the two techniques, and second, it is generally acknowledged that repair is preferable to replacement in small patients because of growth reasons, thereby introducing a strong selection bias. One report shows 10-year survival of only 51% (Fig. 50-16) for patients undergoing mitral valve replacement when the primary diagnosis was mitral regurgitation; however, only 7 of the 145 patients underwent initial mitral valve replacement. The study by McElhinney and colleagues was similar, with only 11 of 108 patients undergoing initial valve replacement; replacement carried a higher mortality.<sup>M6</sup> Another report shows that for a primary diagnosis of mitral stenosis, initial mitral valve replacement was an independent predictor of worse survival over time. M6 However, another study examining patients with primary diagnoses of either stenosis or regurgitation showed no difference between repair and replacement (Fig. 50-17). Other studies with larger numbers of patients undergoing mitral valve replacement have shown that replacement, relative to repair, is not an incremental risk factor for death. Y2

**Figure 50-17** Survival after operation for mitral valve disease, stratified by type of operation. Long-term survival is similar in both groups. Numbers along horizontal axis are patients at risk. (From Yoshimura and colleagues. Y2)

There are several large series reporting outcomes exclusively for mitral valve repair or replacement. Repair series tend to show better outcome than replacement series. This is not surprising, for the same reasons stated in the previous paragraph. In one report of 71 repairs, outstanding early and midterm outcome (4.2% early mortality [CL 1.9%-8.3%] and 94% 5-year survival) was demonstrated. Description another report of 94 patients, early mortality was 8.5% (CL 5.5%-13%) and 5-year survival 89%. Two separate series of mitral repair exclusively for mitral regurgitation showed no early or late mortality. Both series have fewer associated cardiac anomalies and simpler anomalies than most series with a mixture of stenosis and regurgitation patients.

A number of studies exclusively examine valve replacement. Early mortality ranges from 11% to 36% according to a review by Alsoufi and colleagues, which examined 13 recent institutional series. As Furthermore, from the same review, early mortality is even higher in patients younger than age 2: up to 52%. In a multicenter study of 139 patients undergoing replacement, 5-year survival was 75% overall, but survival was strongly affected by the ratio of valve size to patient weight, with higher size/weight ratio associated with decreased survival (Fig. 50-18). In a single-institution study of valve replacement in 25 patients between 1996 and 2006, 5-year survival was 83%. In 104 valve replacements, Kojori

**Figure 50-18** Predicted survival at 1 year versus prosthetic valve *z* value after mitral valve replacement, stratified by prosthesis size. Note that as disparity between prosthetic valve size and normal mitral anulus size increases (increasing *z* value), 1-year survival falls precipitously. This effect is greatest at smaller valve sizes. In this analysis, *z* value was based on Rowlatt and colleaguesR4 (formalin fixed; see Chapter 1). (From Caldarone and colleagues.C1)

and colleagues showed 6-month, 5-year, and 15-year survival of 83% (CL 79%-86%), 70% (CL 65%-75%), and 62% (CL 56%-68%), respectively.K4

Emphasizing the risk of young age on both early and timerelated mortality, in another single institution study of 54 patients undergoing replacement, early mortality was 43% (9 of 21; CL 30%-56%) and 10-year survival 33% in patients aged 2 or younger; early mortality was 6.1% (2 of 33; CL 2.1%-14%) and 10-year survival 81% in patients older than age 2.B2 Masuda and colleagues, however, reported no early mortality (0%; CL 0%-5.0%) and 5 late deaths in 37 patients undergoing valve replacement.M3 Similarly, for patients undergoing valve replacement after 1990, Alexiou and colleagues reported an early mortality of 3.6% (1 of 28; CL 0.6%-12%) and 10-year survival of 86%.A2

## Reoperation

In the past, many reoperations were required because of degeneration of bioprostheses. This is part of the incremental risk of young age on bioprosthesis degenerationS7,T2 (see Fig. 12-42 in Chapter 12). Additionally, small children outgrow both bioprostheses and mechanical prostheses.

Reoperation is much less frequent in the current era particularly in older children who have little remaining growth potential—first, because mechanical prostheses rather than bioprostheses are used when replacement is necessary; and second, because less-than-perfect repairs are now considered unacceptable.

Reoperation may take one of several forms: repeat repair of a previously repaired valve, replacement of a previously repaired valve, replacement of a previously placed prosthesis, or revision and salvage of a previously placed prosthesis.

## *Reoperation Following Mitral Valve Repair*

Early and midterm freedom from reoperation following mitral valve repair in the current era is high but decreases substantially over time. In one study, freedom from

**Figure 50-19** Freedom from reoperation after mitral valve repair or replacement. This study included 79 patients, 74 with mitral regurgitation and 5 with mitral stenosis; age ranged from 2 months to 17 years, mean 4.9 years. (From Aharon and colleagues.A1)

![](_page_13_Figure_14.jpeg)

**Figure 50-20** Competing-risks analysis for subsequent replacement of the initial replaced mitral valve *(MVR)* or death before subsequent re-replacement. Mechanical valves were used as the initial replacement device in 94 of 104 patients. All patients (mean age, 7.4 years; range, birth to 19 years) began at time of initial MVR (*n* = 104) and could transition to either death or a subsequent replacement. Proportion of patients (expressed as percentage of total) in each of three categories adds to 100% at any given time after initial MVR. Solid lines represent parametric point estimates, dashed lines enclose 70% confidence intervals, and circles with error bars represent nonparametric estimates. Numbers in parentheses represent number of patients at risk. (From Kadoba and colleagues.K2)

reoperation was 97% at 2 years and 83% at 8 yearsA1 (Fig. 50-19). In another, it was 95% (95% CL 90%-98%) at 1 year, 80% (95% CL 71%-87%) at 10 years, and 67% (95% CL 52%- 80%) at 15 years.C6 In still another, it was 76% (CL 70%-82%) after 5 years.O2

In a 20-year follow-up study of 56 children, 36 had undergone initial mitral valve repair. Of these, 4 underwent reoperation, with 3 requiring valve replacement for residual mitral regurgitation.Y2

#### *Reoperation Following Mitral Valve Replacement*

Re-replacement after receipt of an original prosthesis is inversely related to age,R1 with reoperation inevitable when a prosthetic valve is inserted into the mitral position in a young patient, because the patient outgrows the valve (Fig. 50-20). Other series examining patients undergoing first valve-replacement surgery at younger than 6 years of age show freedom from re-replacement at 5 years in the range of 70% to 80%, and at 10 years in the range of 25% to 60%. B2,C1,S4 One reoperation generally suffices because a prosthesis two to three times larger can usually be inserted. In older children receiving larger initial valves ( $\geq$ 23 mm), 10- and 15-year freedom from re-replacement is 83% and 83%, respectively.

#### Influence of Young Age at Operation

Reoperation was more frequent in a series of 20 patients with mitral valve disease undergoing operation before age 1 year. USIX early reoperations were performed in five patients, with mitral valve replacement in four, a second valve repair in one, and a mechanical prosthesis thrombectomy in one. Late reoperations on the mitral valve were performed five times, with mitral valve repair in two and replacement in three. Overall freedom from reoperation was 58% (CL 47%-69%) at 7 years, and was similar for patients with an original diagnosis of mitral regurgitation and stenosis (Fig. 50-21). As noted under "Reoperation Following Mitral Valve Replacement," in a multicenter study of mechanical prostheses in a cohort of patients younger than age 5, younger age at first valve placement predicted shorter prosthesis longevity.

#### Reoperation and Use of Artificial Chordae Tendineae

In 16 patients undergoing mitral valve repair using artificial chordae tendineae, no reoperations were required during follow-up of up to 26 months.<sup>M4</sup>

#### **Functional Result**

Most patients who have had a reparative operation for congenital mitral stenosis have a lessened diastolic gradient after repair but continue to have a residual gradient up to about 10 mmHg. C8 An exception is isolated supravalvar ring, in which complete relief of the diastolic gradient may be obtained. C8,M1,N1

Most patients with either congenital mitral stenosis or regurgitation have at least some regurgitation after repair. Carpentier and colleagues reported that in 22 of 34 such patients, there was an apical systolic murmur late postoperatively, and only 7 of the 34 showed important decrease in heart size. C3 Of 12 patients recatheterized, 7 had moderate or severe regurgitation. Flege and colleagues reported a virtually complete repair in only 4 of 13 patients with congenital mitral regurgitation. F2

At follow-up to 15 years, 85% to 100% of patients are in NYHA functional class I<sup>A1,B1,C6,H3,U1,Y2</sup> (Table 50-6). Among patients undergoing repair for mitral valve regurgitation, follow-up echocardiography commonly reveals some regurgitation of mild to moderate degree<sup>A1,B1</sup> (see Table 50-6). However, more recent reports suggest improving functional results (see Table 50-6). Among those undergoing mitral valve repair for stenosis, important residual stenosis is uncommon.<sup>B1,U1</sup>

In the series of 33 late-surviving patients following mitral valve repair in whom no reoperation was performed, Yoshimura and colleagues found that eight patients had grade 1+/6+ or 2+/6+ systolic murmurs with echocardiographic findings of trivial or mild mitral regurgitation. Y2

The hemodynamic state after *replacement* of a congenitally abnormal mitral valve depends on type and size of the replacement device used (see Table 11-9 in Chapter 11). In general, hemodynamic state and valve function are satisfactory unless a device complication develops. In echocardiographic studies by Uva and colleagues, among patients receiving prosthetic mitral valves, transprosthesis gradient was  $6.2 \pm 3.7$  mmHg.<sup>U1</sup>

Prosthetic valves in children have resulted in no higher incidence of thromboembolism and complications from anticoagulation with warfarin than in adults. A6,G2 The possible exception to this may be with use of very small mechanical

# INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

In view of its natural history, severe symptoms and signs of important pulmonary venous hypertension are an indication for prompt operation in infants with congenital mitral valve disease. A reparative operation is indicated if feasible. These same indications prevail in children and young adults. When symptoms are mild or even moderate, operation is delayed in the hope that when it becomes necessary, and if valve replacement is required, an adult-sized device can be used. Operation is indicated even in the absence of marked symptoms when pulmonary hypertension is severe; in this situation, there may be right-to-left shunting across a patent ductus arteriosus or foramen ovale.

Surgery may be indicated in asymptomatic patients with moderate or worse mitral regurgitation in whom a simple and reliable reparative procedure is anticipated, such as closure of a regurgitant cleft. Delay in repair may lead to progressive damage to the valve, increasing the chance that repair will not be effective.

When repair is performed, long-term follow-up is indicated because of need in some patients for reoperation. When valve replacement is performed in infants, children, and young adults, a bioprosthesis is contraindicated because of its rapid degeneration in these age groups. A mechanical prosthesis is currently the device of choice, with long-term warfarin anticoagulation.

It is important to identify coexisting congenital mitral valve disease in patients being considered for repair of LV outflow tract obstruction, VSD, tetralogy of Fallot, or double outlet right ventricle. When mitral disease is present and is moderate or severe, the mitral disease must also be treated operatively.

#### SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

## Valved Conduit Bypass of the Mitral Valve

When the mitral anulus is very small, a valved conduit (similar to that used for right ventricular–pulmonary trunk reconstruction) may be placed between the left atrium and LV. Laks and colleagues reported such a procedure (which was unsuccessful) in 1980, and Lansing and colleagues reported a successful case in a 10-year-old girl in 1983.L1,L2 Others have used this technique with good early results.C9,M5 Late results are not available.

#### Pulmonary Autograft Mitral Valve Replacement

Replacing the mitral valve with a pulmonary autograft, sometimes known as the *Ross II operation,* was initially described in 1967.R3 It is only in the last decade that this procedure has been widely used, primarily in countries with a high prevalence of rheumatic disease, limited financial resources, and poor programs for follow-up anticoagulation monitoring. A 2004 review of worldwide use of the procedure identified 103 cases from 14 reports, with one report accounting for 80 patients.A5,K1 In that series, 78 of 80 patients had rheumatic disease, and 2 had congenital mitral valve disease; ages of the latter two patients were 4 years (primary mitral stenosis) and 6 years (primary mitral regurgitation). Overall early mortality was 5.0% (4 of 80; CL 2.6%-8.9%), and late mortality 6.25%, but no follow-up specific to the two congenital patients was reported, other than that the 6-year-old developed stenosis of the right ventricle–to–pulmonary artery trunk conduit at 1 year.

Brown and colleagues reported eight patients, four of whom had congenital mitral valve diseaseB8; two of the four had previously placed prosthetic valves that required re-replacement, and two had previously repaired atrioventricular septal defects. Ages of the four ranged from 12 to 22 years at autograft mitral valve replacement. There was no early or late mortality at a mean follow-up of 6.2 months, although one patient required autograft replacement owing to stenosis.

Four other case reports, totaling five patients, describe use of a pulmonary autograft for congenital mitral valve disease in infants ranging from age 2 to 11 monthsF4,T1,T3,Y1; among these, one died (20%; CL 3.2%-53%), one required immediate reoperation, and three survived with no more than shortterm follow-up. One other case report describes emergency pulmonary autograft mitral valve replacement in a 36-monthold with a thrombosed mechanical valve originally placed for endocarditis.M7 Again there was no mid- or long-term follow-up. A pulmonary autograft currently cannot be recommended for congenital mitral valve disease, especially in infants. The experience is limited, and important problems have been demonstrated upon early assessment, with no longterm follow-up available.

## Percutaneous Balloon Mitral Valvuloplasty for Congenital Mitral Stenosis

Experience with this technique is small and limited to a few institutions, in contrast to the procedure applied to older patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis. The four reports in the literature total 81 patients, the last one in 2005G5,K5,L5,M6; 64 are from one study.M6 Peak mitral valve gradient was reduced by a median of 33%, but moderate or severe mitral regurgitation was induced in 28% of patients. Procedurerelated mortality was 4.7% (3 of 64; CL 2.1%-9.2%) and 5-year survival 74%. One or more reinterventions were needed in 56% of survivors. The procedure is contraindicated when supravalvar mitral stenosis, additional intracardiac anomalies requiring surgery, or important mitral regurgitation are present. Younger age was associated with worse survival and need for more frequent and earlier reintervention.

Because of limited worldwide experience and high prevalence of induced mitral regurgitation, this procedure should be considered unproven and somewhat experimental, especially in young patients.
