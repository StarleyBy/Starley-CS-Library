# DEFINITION

Mitral regurgitation due to ischemic heart disease (ischemic mitral regurgitation) is mitral regurgitation *caused by* ischemic heart disease. This entity must not be confused with mitral regurgitation from other causes that *coexist* with ischemic heart disease.

# HISTORICAL NOTE

Mitral regurgitation resulting from rupture of a papillary muscle has been long recognized as a rare and frequently catastrophic complication of acute myocardial infarction (MI).B12,S2 A case was identified at autopsy at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1935,S6 but apparently the diagnosis was first made antemortem in 1948.D2 Mitral regurgitation without papillary muscle rupture, occurring as an acute or chronic complication of ischemic heart disease with or without MI, was described in 1963 by Burch and colleagues.B14 These authors referred to this type of ischemic mitral regurgitation as "papillary muscle dysfunction," the presence of which was surmised rather than proved. The first successful surgical correction of papillary muscle rupture was reported by Austen and colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1965.A3 Surgeons at Massachusetts General were also among the first to replace the mitral valve for ischemic mitral regurgitation, beginning in 1970.R1

#### MORPHOLOGY

Acute Mitral Regurgitation Complicating Myocardial Infarction

*Rupture of Papillary Muscle*

Rupture of a papillary muscle occurs as an acute complication of MI, but its prevalence among patients with acute mitral regurgitation in the early stages of infarction is uncertain. About half of these patients have an actual rupture. About one third of patients with rupture may have a complete disruption of the papillary muscle, resulting in flailing of both the anterior and the posterior mitral leaflets.B2,W2 About two thirds of patients have rupture of one or more heads of the papillary muscle rather than a complete rupture of the entire muscle.B2 The posteromedial papillary muscle is ruptured in about 75% of patients and the anterolateral muscle in about 25%.B2,N2,W2 Correspondingly, most patients with acute mitral regurgitation resulting from MI have an inferoposterior left ventricular (LV) infarction.B2,E1 Also, at least in the study of Coma-Canella and colleagues, many have coexisting right ventricular infarction.C6 Regardless, when the LV infarction is located inferoposteriorly rather than anterolaterally, the reason for more frequent rupture of the adjacent papillary muscle is not clear. The difference in collateral circulation to the two areas may play a role.E2 The size and nature of the coexisting acute LV infarction vary, perhaps because of the

small number of cases in most series. Nishimura and colleagues reported that the infarction is often small,N2 whereas Barbour and colleagues found infarction in more than 20% of the LV wall and septum in the majority of patients.B2 The infarction may be subendocardial or transmural.

Occasionally, papillary muscle rupture is associated with rupture of the ventricular septum as well as with rupture of the free wall of the LV.L6,R1,S1,V2,W1

#### *Papillary Muscle Necrosis without Rupture*

About half the patients who develop severe mitral regurgitation during acute MI do not have papillary muscle rupture, only papillary muscle necrosis. Papillary muscle dysfunction may contribute to resultant mitral regurgitation. However, contiguous MI probably plays a more important role. The distribution of necrotic changes and extent of MI are similar to those described for papillary muscle rupture.

#### *Other Causes*

Mitral regurgitation is a frequent complication of acute MI. When Doppler echocardiography is used for diagnosis, mitral regurgitation has been detected in up to 39% of patients early after an infarction.B3 Substantial (moderate or severe) mitral regurgitation is present in 3% to 19% of patients and is an important predictor of mortalityG5,G8,L1,L3,T3,V1 (Fig. 10-1). Because papillary muscle rupture or necrosis occurs infrequently after acute infarction, other important causes of mitral regurgitation include (1) changes in configuration of the LV (remodeling), (2) global or segmental LV dysfunction, and (3) changes in function of the mitral valve resulting from leaflet prolapse, abnormal closure, or anular dilatation. Although papillary muscle dysfunction has been implicated as an important cause of ischemic mitral regurgitation,B14 experimental and clinical studies employing two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography have demonstrated that it rarely is causative.D4 LV systolic dysfunction, increased LV chamber sphericity, and regional asynergy of the inferoposterolateral wall overlying the posterior papillary muscle may be important determinants of developing mitral regurgitation.D4,V1 Van Dantzig and colleagues found that changes in the mitral valve anulus and leaflets were of limited importance in the pathogenesis of ischemic mitral regurgitation early after MI.V1 Thus, although there is often no apparent structural abnormality of the mitral valve, changes in configuration and contractile function of the LV after an acute infarction prevent adequate coaptation of the leaflets and result in mitral regurgitation.

### Chronic Mitral Regurgitation from Ischemic Heart Disease

Many patients with ischemic heart disease and chronic mitral regurgitation have *coexisting* mitral regurgitation caused by rheumatic fever, myxomatous degeneration, or other conditions.B7 At operation, distinction between mitral regurgitation *coexisting with* ischemic heart disease and that *caused by* ischemic heart disease can be difficult because papillary muscle scarring or fibrosis is not always the result of earlier necrosis or adjacent MI.B10,C6,S3 Chronic regurgitation through the mitral valve apparatus does follow acute MI in some patients.B3,D4,I1,O1,T1 The regurgitation may be localized to the region of the posteromedial or anterolateral commissure or both.J1 Causes include underlying papillary muscle ischemic dysfunction, papillary muscle scarring and shortening or even lengthening, previous rupture of a portion of the papillary muscle, asynergy of the adjacent LV wall, and LV remodeling, all of which can result from an earlier MI.J1,L4 Chronic regurgitation may also occur through the central part of the valve.I1,G8 This can result from restricted leaflet motion with increased leaflet tethering (Figs. 10-2 and 10-3) and from anular dilatation secondary to ischemic LV dysfunction.G5,L4 Severity and degree of the dysfunction may vary over time according to the degree of remodeling (increased sphericity) that occurs in the individual patient after infarction.D4,R3,V1

# CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

#### Acute Mitral Regurgitation Complicating Myocardial Infarction

Papillary muscle rupture presents as an acute event within a few hours to 14 days after an MI in 1% to 3% of patients.K3,W2 The onset is usually characterized by pulmonary edema, hypotension, or both, typically 2 to 7 days after acute infarction.N2,V2,W2 Rupture is signaled by worsening of the patient's clinical condition. Profound shock indicates gross mitral regurgitation from total rupture; less severe signs suggest less severe mitral regurgitation from partial rupture or LV dysfunction.D4,V1 A new apical systolic murmur can be heard provided cardiac output is adequate and the regurgitation is not severe. The murmur is frequently absent in total rupture and usually present in partial rupture.V2 An apical third heart sound is common, and pulmonary edema is often seen on chest radiography. The heart is usually normal in size or only slightly enlarged, and the left atrium is small.

A pulmonary artery (Swan-Ganz) catheter can provide important information (e.g., excluding the presence of leftto-right shunting) and, when it is in the pulmonary artery wedge position, may demonstrate a prominent *v* wave on the pressure tracing. Echocardiography (2D or transesophageal) is a valuable diagnostic tool in mitral regurgitation associated with MI.N2 It is used to differentiate between papillary muscle rupture and LV dysfunction. In the latter condition, extensive wall motion abnormalities are usually present. With papillary muscle rupture, the mitral leaflet becomes flail and prolapses into the left atrium during systole.N2 The ruptured portion of the muscle may be directly visualized as a separate mass attached to the chordae.E1,M6,N2 Left ventriculography may be performed to confirm the diagnosis of mitral regurgitation (or ventricular septal defect or occasionally both) and to define areas of impaired LV contraction or aneurysm formation. In critically ill patients, however, left ventriculography is unnecessary when precatheterization studies have

established the diagnosis and only coronary angiography is performed. When the patient is seriously ill, an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) should be used. If the patient's hemodynamic state remains unstable, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) can be established using a percutaneous technique (see "Cardiopulmonary Bypass Established by Peripheral Cannulation" under Special Situations and Controversies in Section III of Chapter 2). These devices can be left in place until cardiac catheterization is completed and the patient is taken to the operating room.

# Chronic Mitral Regurgitation from Ischemic Heart Disease

Usually the patient presents with gradually increasing mitral regurgitation. When the murmur dates from an MI, an ischemic etiology is assumed. There may be cardiac enlargement, including left atrial enlargement, hypokinesia, and akinesia at the infarction site. An LV aneurysm may coexist (see Chapter 8). Positron emission tomography (PET) or dobutamine echocardiography may reveal chronically ischemic, hibernating myocardium that may respond to increased blood flow from coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) alone.F2,H4,P1 Gadolinium contrast-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance reveals myocardial scarring, and if the posterior papillary muscle is extensively scarred (nonviable), mitral anuloplasty may be insufficient to eliminate ischemic mitral regurgitation.F3 Other diagnostic criteria are the same as for other types of chronic mitral regurgitation (see Chapter 11).

#### NATURAL HISTORY

#### Acute Mitral Regurgitation Complicating Myocardial Infarction

Rupture of a papillary muscle is an uncommon complication of acute MIW2 and currently is probably even less common, given the widespread use of thrombolytic and percutaneous interventional therapy for acute infarction.H5 It is, however, a life-threatening complication, with only about 25% of patients treated nonsurgically surviving more than 24 hours after total rupture.S2,V2 Survival after partial papillary rupture is better; more than 70% of patients survive the first 24 hours, and about 50% survive more than 1 month. They are then considered to have chronic mitral regurgitation.

When the papillary muscle remains intact, the natural history of acute mitral regurgitation is less well defined. As previously noted, however, moderate or severe mitral regurgitation in the absence of papillary muscle rupture is present in 3% to 19% of patients early after an acute infarction and is an important predictor of mortality.L1,L3,T3,V1 Using multivariable analysis, Lehmann and colleagues found that mitral regurgitation of any degree (as detected by left ventriculography) was a predictor of cardiovascular mortality at 1 year (relative risk 7.5; CL 2%-29%; *P* = .0008).L3 In the study of Lamas and colleagues, cardiovascular mortality during 31 years of follow-up was also higher in patients who developed mitral regurgitation early after acute infarction than in those who did not (29% vs. 12%; *P* < .001).L1 Grigioni and colleagues observed a direct and significant correlation between severity of mitral regurgitation as determined by echocardiography and long-term survivalG8 (see Fig. 10-1). They also observed that mitral regurgitation predicts mortality in excess of that anticipated on the basis of patient characteristics and degree of LV dysfunction.

#### Chronic Mitral Regurgitation from Ischemic Heart Disease

Mild or moderate mitral regurgitation without papillary muscle rupture is episodic in some patients, presumably a result of changing prevalence and distribution of ischemic myocardium, loading characteristics of the LV, and variations in LV function.L4 Persistent and severe mitral regurgitation, often associated with moderate or severe LV dysfunction, worsens the prognosis for patients with poor LV function.T5 Furthermore, increasing severity of mitral regurgitation has an increasingly adverse effect on survival, regardless of type of treatmentG8,H5,L4,P2 (Fig. 10-4).

#### TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

#### Acute Mitral Regurgitation Complicating Myocardial Infarction

In critically ill patients with this complication of acute MI, IABP is begun as soon as the condition is recognized,B13 or CPB is established by percutaneous technique if indicated

(see "Cardiopulmonary Bypass Established by Peripheral Cannulation" under Special Situations and Controversies in Section III of Chapter 2). In the operating room, the patient is prepared and draped for CABG; the sternotomy, graft preparation, and preparation for CPB are expeditiously accomplished. CPB is established using two venous cannulae. If CPB was established percutaneously before bringing the patient to the operating room, the cannulations just described should be made and CPB established by a pump-oxygenator designed for use in the operating room. The peripheral lines are clamped but left in place. These cannulae are removed in the operating room at the end of the cardiac procedure.

Myocardial management may include warm induction of cardioplegia and controlled aortic root reperfusion (see "Cold Cardioplegia, Controlled Aortic Root Perfusion, and [When Needed] Warm Cardioplegic Induction" in Chapter 3). Because an acute coronary occlusion is typically present, the coronary sinus route of administration should be employed for part of the cardioplegic infusion (see "Technique of Retrograde Infusion" under Cold Cardioplegia [Multidose] in Chapter 3). The distal anastomoses of the bypass grafts are performed before the mitral valve is repaired or replaced to avoid retracting the heart after a mitral prosthesis (valve or ring) has been inserted and thus prevent possible rupture of an area of infracted LV.H1 The proximal anastomoses of the grafts can be performed either immediately after completing the distal anastomoses and before opening the left atrium, or after closing the left atrium. If the left atrium has been closed, these anastomoses can be performed with the aorta still occluded or after removing the aortic clamp and placing a partially occluding clamp on the aorta while rewarming is completed.

The approach to the mitral valve is generally through the left atrium, although an approach through the right atrium may be useful (see "Approach Across the Atrial Septum" under Special Situations and Controversies in Chapter 11). With acute total papillary muscle rupture, the mitral valve is replaced with a mechanical prosthesis or bioprosthesis. Because the mitral anular tissue is usually not thickened and may be more friable than normal, great care must be taken to (1) obtain adequate bites of tissue when placing the anular sutures and (2) avoid excessive traction on these sutures as the valve is lowered into position, to prevent them from pulling through the tissue. Pledgeted mattress or nonpledgeted simple interrupted sutures are preferred.

When the papillary muscle is not ruptured and the chordal mechanism is intact, or if only one head is ruptured and there is anular dilatation, reparative techniques and anuloplasty with or without use of an anuloplasty ring are preferable to valve replacementH5,R3 (see "Mitral Regurgitation Repair" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 11). If an anuloplasty ring or band is inserted, it is probably preferable to use one that is smaller than the sizer that fits the anulus. After CPB is discontinued and with cannulae still in place, competence of the valve is assessed, preferably by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Left atrial pressure should be at least 15 mmHg and systolic arterial pressure above 120 to 130 mmHg during the assessment. If the valve is not competent, CPB is reestablished, cardioplegia is reinfused, and the valve is either repaired again or replaced. The remainder of the operation is completed as usual. An IABP or temporary ventricular assistance may be needed (see "Treatment of Low Cardiac Output" under Cardiovascular Subsystem in Section I of Chapter 5).

#### Chronic Mitral Regurgitation from Ischemic Heart Disease

The techniques of repair and replacement of the chronically regurgitant mitral valve are described under "Technique of Operation" in Chapter 11. Difficulties in intraoperative decision making result from (1) time-related variability in the magnitude of regurgitation caused by ischemic heart disease, (2) uncertainty about the precise morphologic basis of the regurgitation, and (3) frequency with which regurgitation is associated with poor LV function. These considerations require careful evaluation of regurgitation and need for mitral repair or replacement preoperatively, in the operating room before CPB is established, after repair while CPB is still in place, and after CPB is discontinued.

Evaluation includes careful assessment of the intraoperative TEE, visual examination of the morphology of the valve, and identification of the location and magnitude of the regurgitation. Identifying the location and assessing the magnitude of regurgitation are accomplished by TEE, recognizing that this technique may overestimate or underestimate the degree of regurgitation (see Fig. 10-2). When the circulation is intact, echocardiographic assessments should be made with left atrial pressure at least 12 to 15 mmHg and systolic pressure above 120 to 130 mmHg.

On direct visualization of the valve, diagnosis of an ischemic etiology for regurgitation is generally made by exclusion. The anulus appears normal or is only slightly dilated. The leaflets are usually normal in appearance, and the chordae tendineae are usually not shortened or elongated. The papillary muscles may be pale, scarred, or normal in appearance. In this setting, repair of the valve with some form of anuloplasty is usually possible (see Chapter 11). When regurgitation is *severe* both preoperatively and intraoperatively and dominates the clinical picture, mitral repair or replacement is indicated. When severity of regurgitation is *variable* preoperatively and variable and no more than moderate intraoperatively (particularly when severity lessens after the CABG portion of the operation is completed), and signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia are dominant, the mitral valve may be left alone. However, this recommendation is controversial.A1,A2,B4,C4,D6,D9,G1,G2,M4,Y1 *Intermediate situations* demand individual intraoperative decision making.

When a repair is performed, the functional status of the mitral valve is evaluated by TEE after discontinuing CPB, with the cannulae still in place and with the systolic arterial pressure above 120 to 130 mmHg. If the hemodynamic situation or the repair is unsatisfactory, CPB can be reestablished and the mitral valve repaired again or replaced. If mitral replacement is necessary, every effort should be made to preserve the chordae tendineae to the posterior leaflet or to both leaflets.G1,G7

# SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

The usual management protocols are followed (see Chapter 5). Because patients with mitral regurgitation from ischemic heart disease are apt to have low cardiac output postoperatively, catecholamine support and IABP are required more often than after other procedures.

#### RESULTS

#### Early (Hospital) Death

# *Acute Mitral Regurgitation Complicating Myocardial Infarction*

Because of the rarity of the condition, only a few surgical series have been reported. Among those with the largest numbers of patients (between 21 and 55), early mortality ranged from 18% to 22%.C2,C3,R5,T2 For patients without rupture of a papillary muscle who require operation for ischemic mitral regurgitation, hospital mortality is substantial, particularly for patients in cardiogenic shock.C3,D7,H3,R2,T4 With use of appropriate myocardial management (see "Technique of Operation"), early mortality should depend primarily on extent of MI. Chevalier and colleaguesC3 and Russo and colleaguesR5 reported lower early operative mortality among patients who had concomitant CABG. This supports the earlier observation of Hickey and colleagues that early reperfusion of ischemic myocardium in this setting is beneficial.H5

#### *Chronic Mitral Regurgitation from Ischemic Heart Disease*

Recent experience indicates that hospital mortality for patients with chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation who undergo valve repair or replacement, usually in combination with CABG, and who are not in cardiogenic shock, is approximately 3% to 11%.B4,B11,C5,D1,D6,G2,H2,K2,M4 Incremental risk factors for increased hospital mortality include low ejection fraction, extensive coronary artery disease, advanced age, renal disease, lower hematocrit, LV end-diastolic dimension greater than 65 mm, longer CPB time, and need for inotropic support.B11,G7,H1,H3,H5,K2,M4,Y1 Although mitral valve repair is generally preferable to replacement, hospital mortality in several large series has not been consistently lower among patients who underwent repair.C5,G4,H2 Concomitant procedures such as LV aneurysmectomy may be associated with increased hospital mortality.G7

#### Time-Related Survival

When the operation is done acutely for rupture of papillary muscle, late results are favorable.B13,C2,N1,R5,T2 In three of the largest reported series, despite substantial early mortality, 5-year survival was 68%, 65%, and 65%.C2,R5,T2 In the largest reported series (54 patients from Mayo Clinic), 5-year survival was 65 ± 7%, and survival free of heart failure was 52 ± 7% (Fig. 10-5).R5 In this study, 5-year survival of 30-day operative survivors was 79 ± 4%, identical (*P* = .2) to that of matched controls with MI but without rupture of the papillary muscle. Survival free of heart failure was also similar (10-year survival, 28 ± 8% vs. 36 ± 6%; *P* = .5).

Overall survival after CABG, including hospital mortality, is distinctly poorer in patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation than in those without it.H5 Also, survival after CABG plus mitral valve replacement or repair is poorer when the regurgitation is ischemic in origin rather than rheumatic or degenerative.G1 These differences probably relate to more LV dysfunction in patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation.G3,M5,R1 Nonetheless, survival of patients with chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation who are treated surgically is better than that of those treated medically.H5

**Figure 10-5** Overall (including operative mortality) long-term survival *(blue line)* and long-term survival free of heart failure (HF) *(red line)* after surgery for post–myocardial infarction papillary muscle rupture. Numbers on each curve indicate 5- and 10-year estimated survival and survival free of HF (±1 standard error). (From Russo and colleagues.R5)

Risk factors for poor outcomes in patients with ischemic heart disease in general apply to this group as well (see Chapter 7).

Addition of LV aneurysmectomy to the procedure adversely affects long-term survival. Miller and colleagues found poor late results in this group, with only 35% (CL 4%-25%) of hospital survivors alive 3 years later.M5 In a longer experience with valve replacement as an isolated or combined procedure, Karp and colleagues found that preoperative LV aneurysm was a significant incremental risk factor for premature late death.K1

In the study of Hickey and colleagues, mitral valve repair was associated with better long-term survival than mitral valve replacement.H5 In a more recent nonrandomized study of surgery for ischemic mitral regurgitation, however, Hausmann and colleagues observed similar early and late survival among 197 patients treated by mitral valve replacement and 140 patients treated by mitral valve repair.H2 Seven-year survival was 67% and 62%, respectively, although it was better among patients who had no or minimal mitral regurgitation after the repair (77% at 7 years) than among those who had more extensive regurgitation or mitral valve replacement.H2

Gillinov and colleagues, using propensity analysis and multivariable hazard function regression, observed that in patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation who were not at high risk (younger age, lower New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class, fewer wall motion abnormalities, no renal dysfunction), mitral valve repair was associated with higher survival at 5 years (58%) than was valve replacement (36%) (*P* = .08).G4 There was no survival benefit for mitral valve repair among higher-risk patients. A randomized trial of valve repair vs. valve replacement for patients with severe chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation is ongoing (2010) in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) sponsored Cardiothoracic Surgery Network. A concurrent randomized trial of CABG alone vs. CABG plus mitral anuloplasty for moderate chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation is ongoing as well.

#### Functional State

Symptomatic relief is generally good in the early years after operation in survivors of mitral valve repair or replacement and CABGB4,D1,D6,G2 (Fig. 10-6). It is more frequently observed in patients whose LV end-diastolic dimension is less than 65 to 70 mm on echocardiography.B11,O2 Of importance, early symptomatic relief of heart failure symptoms and absence of mitral regurgitation after mitral valve repair is not sustained in all patients.C1,H6,M2

# INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

When a patient with an acute MI suddenly develops acute mitral regurgitation, operation is advisable, recognizing that hospital mortality under such circumstances may be substantial. As with acute rupture of the ventricular septum (see Chapter 9), operation should be done before severe hemodynamic deterioration occurs. When the hemodynamic state is stable, one strategy has been to delay operation about 2 weeks to 2 months. However, Nishimura and colleagues reported sudden deterioration followed by death in five patients whose condition had initially stabilized with medical therapy.N2 Therefore, all patients with papillary muscle rupture complicating acute MI should have prompt investigation and operation. Operation should be avoided only when the patient is moribund.

When chronic mitral regurgitation results from ischemic heart disease, indications for operation are less well defined. Infrequently, and particularly when it develops acutely from partial rupture of a papillary muscle after MI, mitral regurgitation dominates the clinical picture and causes the symptoms and disability. Then the decision for operation on the mitral valve is straightforward and based on the usual indications (see Chapter 11). Concomitant CABG is performed if indicated. More often, however, patients with usual symptoms of ischemic heart disease requiring CABG have some signs of LV failure and clinical and angiographic evidence of mitral regurgitation. As already mentioned, the degree of regurgitation may fluctuate, but it may be constant and moderate or severe. In the latter circumstance, mitral valve repair or replacement is indicated.

When the severity of regurgitation varies over time, it is more difficult to know when mitral valve surgery should be done at the time of CABG. The effect of CABG alone on this form of mitral regurgitation is not known with certainty. If mitral regurgitation is at least moderate (grade 3 or more on a scale of 1 to 6), however, as determined by intraoperative TEE, and under the appropriate loading conditions, mitral repair or replacement is usually indicated (see "Technique of Operation"). If mitral regurgitation is severe in patients with a low ejection fraction (10%-20%), mitral valve replacement rather than repair may be preferable, because persistent mitral regurgitation after repair is associated with substantial early and late mortality.H2 Patients with severe LV dysfunction and mitral regurgitation who are suitable candidates should be considered for transplantation as an alternative to myocardial revascularization and mitral repair or replacement.H3,Y1

# SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

Controversy persists regarding the role of mitral valve repair or replacement in patients undergoing CABG who have ischemic mitral regurgitation. No randomized trials comparing CABG vs. CABG plus mitral valve repair or replacement in patients with mild or moderate mitral regurgitation, or comparing mitral valve repair vs. mitral valve replacement in patients with severe ischemic mitral regurgitation with or without concomitant CABG, have yet been reported. Until the results of such studies become available, management of patients with these conditions will continue to be individualized, relying on currently available information. Accumulating evidence, however, suggests that in carefully matched patients with severe functional ischemic mitral regurgitation (LV ejection fraction ≤ 45%), long-term survival and functional status are not improved by adding mitral valve anuloplasty to CABGM4 (Fig. 10-7). Other observational studies support these findings.B5,D6,G6,W3,W4

### Types of Mitral Anuloplasty Devices

A number of devices have been devised and evaluated for the treatment of ischemic mitral regurgitation. These include posterior anuloplasty bands (flexible or rigid) and complete rings, which can be flexible, semi-rigid, rigid, flat, or shaped. No large trials comparing the relative efficacy of these devices have been performed. An observational study of 169 patients who received either a flexible (n = 117) or rigid (n = 52) ring and who had similar baseline characteristics demonstrated a similar degree of improvement in LV dimensions in the two groups, although systolic function did not improve.S4 Fewer patients with rigid rings remained in NYHA class III or IV. Improvement in the degree of mitral regurgitation was better in the rigid-ring group (*P* = .006). There was also a lower prevalence of recurrent mitral regurgitation in the rigid-ring group.

### *Restrictive Anuloplasty*

Restrictive anuloplasty, a technique for reducing the size of the mitral anulus initially reported by Bolling and colleagues,B8 is widely used for treating ischemic mitral regurgitation.B4,B11,G2

Standard sizers are used to determine the size of a ring that conforms to the anterior mitral leaflet and the intertrigonal distance of the mitral valve. A ring two or more sizes smaller than this is selected and used for the repair. Proponents of this technique cite as possible advantages the elimination of mitral regurgitation and reverse remodeling, particularly in patients with LV end-diastolic dimensions of 65 mm or less.B4,B11,G2 Functional mitral stenosis has been reported to occur with this technique.M1

#### Alternatives to Isolated Anuloplasty for Surgical Treatment

Several alternative strategies have been proposed to address ischemic mitral regurgitation. *Division of secondary chords* (chordal cutting) has been shown experimentally to decrease leaflet tethering and mitral regurgitation in a sheep model.M3 The largest clinical experience with this technique is that of Borger and colleagues.B9 Secondary chords to the anterior leaflet, posterior leaflet, and the commissure arising from one or both papillary muscles affected by infarcted myocardium were severed and a posterior undersized anuloplasty band inserted in 43 patients. In comparison with 49 control patients in whom only an anuloplasty band was used, the chordal cutting group had greater mobility of the anterior leaflet (*P* = .01) and less recurrent mitral regurgitation (15% vs. 37%) during the 2-year follow-up interval.

*Posterior mitral leaflet extension* with pericardium has been evaluated as a method to reduce the severity of ischemic mitral regurgitation.D8,L2,R4 This technique was used by deVarennes and colleagues in 44 patients with severe (4+) ischemic mitral regurgitation, enlarging the posterior half of the posterior leaflet (half of P2 and all of P3) with a 1.0 × 3.5- to 4.5-cm patch of bovine pericardium.D3 An anuloplasty ring (not downsized) was also used. Actuarial freedom from moderate or severe recurrent mitral regurgitation was 90% 2 years postoperatively, and 92% of the patients were in NYHA class I.

*Relocation of the posterior papillary muscle* in conjunction with a partially flexible anuloplasty ring (not downsized) has been used in a small number of patients by Kron and colleagues.K4 A 3-0 polypropylene suture is passed twice through the fibrous portion of the tip of the posterior papillary muscle. It is then passed through the adjacent mitral anulus just posterior to the right fibrous trigone. The suture is tightened until leaflet coaptation is achieved. In a series of 18 patients with 2+ to 3+ mitral regurgitation preoperatively, 3 had trace and 15 had no mitral regurgitation 2 months postoperatively.

A *papillary muscle sling* has been proposed and evaluated by Hvass and Joudinaud to correct ischemic mitral regurgitation.H7 After mobilizing the trabeculations of the posterior papillary muscle through the mitral valve, a 4-mm tube of polytetrafluoroethylene is drawn around the two papillary muscles, forming an intraventricular sling that is secured with sutures so that there is no gap between the muscles. An anuloplasty ring (not or only moderately downsized) is then inserted. Among 37 patients with moderate or severe mitral regurgitation, mean ejection fraction of 30%, and a mean LV end-diastolic dimension of 70 mm, early mortality was 5% (2 patients; CL 1.8%-12%). All but two of the surviving patients were in NYHA class I or II, LV end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions were reduced, ejection fraction increased, and 5-year survival was 80%. Other interventions (edge-to-edge leaflet approximation [external or internal], infarct plication, and external restraint systems) are currently under investigation.B1,B6,D5,F1,S5 Heart transplantation remains a viable alternative for patients with advanced disease.Y1
