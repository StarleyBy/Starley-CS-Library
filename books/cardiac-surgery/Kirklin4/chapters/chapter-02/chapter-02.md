## **Section I Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest**

### HISTORICAL NOTE

In 1950, Bigelow and colleagues, in their publications on experimental hypothermia produced by surface cooling, introduced the concept that whole-body hypothermia might be useful in cardiac surgery.B30,B31 They subsequently reported cooling dogs to 20°C by surface cooling, with recovery after 15 minutes of circulatory arrest.B29 In 1951, Boerema and colleagues reported experimental studies indicating that when animals were cooled by a femoral-femoral shunt through a cooling coil, up to 15 minutes of circulatory arrest (produced by inflow stasis) were tolerated without apparent ill effect.B41 Using surface cooling, Lewis and Taufic reported successful repair of an atrial septal defect in a 5-year-old girl in 1953, and in the same year, Swan and colleagues reported successful results in a series of patients treated using the same technique.L13,S42 In 1958, Sealy and colleagues reported successful clinical cases in which hypothermia was combined with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).S4 In 1959, Drew and colleagues reported experimental studies in which CPB (using the subject's own lungs as the oxygenator) was used to cool and rewarm the subject, and operations were done during circulatory arrest at 15°C.D19

In 1960, Guiot and colleagues and Weiss and colleagues reported use of hypothermia and circulatory arrest for cardiac surgery in humans.G33,W10 In 1961, Kirklin and colleagues at Mayo Clinic reported results of operation with hypothermic circulatory arrest in 52 patients, using Drew's technique in 23 and a pump-oxygenator in 29.K11 In 1963, Horiuchi and colleagues from Tohoku University reported using surface cooling to 25°C and circulatory arrest during repair of ventricular septal defect in 18 infants younger than 1 year of age, with 16 survivors.H38 Dillard and colleagues modified this technique to permit surface cooling to hypothermic temperatures of 17°C to 20°C and extension of circulatory arrest to 60 minutes. In 1967, they reported successful repair of total anomalous pulmonary venous connection in four infants by this method of surface cooling and rewarming.D12 Similar experiences with this and other congenital malformations were reported by Hikasa and colleagues and Wakusawa and colleagues.H29,W2

In 1970, Barratt-Boyes and colleagues in New Zealand reported repair of a variety of malformations during hypothermic circulatory arrest in 34 infants weighing less than 10 kg using surface cooling to 22°C to 27°C, followed by a brief period of CPB to reduce the temperature further, as well as rewarming with CPB.B8 In 1973, using only CPB for cooling (core cooling), Hamilton and colleagues reported operations with hypothermic circulatory arrest in 18 infants.H9 These experiences and subsequent modifications in technique opened the way for safer intracardiac surgery in neonates and infants.T31

Use of hypothermic circulatory arrest in combination with CPB in adults was first reported by Barnard and Schrire in 1963.B4 Two patients with aneurysms of the ascending aorta and aortic arch underwent replacement of the involved aortic segments using hypothermia to an esophageal temperature of approximately 10°C and short intervals of circulatory arrest. One survived. In 1964, Borst and colleagues reported successful repair of an arteriovenous fistula involving the aortic arch using a period of hypothermic circulatory arrest.B44 In 1969, Lillehei and colleagues reported use of partial CPB, hypothermia, and circulatory arrest for managing ruptured mycotic aneurysms, ruptured left ventricles, and other complicated cardiac pathology.L16 The first series of patients with aneurysms of the aortic arch that were successfully resected during an interval of hypothermic circulatory arrest was reported by Griepp and colleagues in 1975.G31

#### HYPOTHESES

A basic hypothesis underlying use of circulatory arrest for cardiac and aortic surgery is that there is a safe duration of this state, the length of which is inversely related to temperature of the organism during the arrest period. A safe period of circulatory arrest is characterized by absence of detectable functional or structural organ derangements in the early or late postoperative period. Structural derangements without apparent functional correlates are of concern, particularly in the central nervous system, because of an implied loss of neurologic reserve that may be important to the individual later in life.

*Temperature of the organism* is not easily defined or described. In normal humans, temperature gradients between areas of the body at rest are small, so a single representation of inner body temperature is generally acceptable.B61 When hypothermia is produced by surface cooling, internal temperature gradients are relatively small, although skin and muscles become cooler than inner organs, and rectal temperature is substantially lower than nasopharyngeal temperature.C18 During cooling by hypothermic perfusion with CPB (core cooling), the relationship of rectal to nasopharyngeal temperature is reversed, and regional differences in temperature are considerable, although they can be lessened by prolonging the period of cooling.C18 Thus, when the latter technique is used wholly or in part to induce hypothermia, the specific site of temperature measurement, as well as the limitations in interpretation of the measurements themselves, must be noted.

Another hypothesis is that hypothermia, without itself producing damage, reduces metabolic activity to the extent that available energy stores in the various organs maintain cell viability throughout the ischemic period of circulatory arrest and thus allow normal structure and function to return after reperfusion. The magnitude of reduction of oxygen consumption is hypothesized to directly relate to safe duration of circulatory arrest.

### OXYGEN CONSUMPTION DURING HYPOTHERMIA

Oxygen consumption (V O2) is considered a measure of metabolic activity, so the magnitude of its decrease by hypothermia (in the anesthetized subject in whom shivering is prevented) is an index of the degree of reduction of metabolic activity. Use of V O2 as such a marker is reasonable because for all practical purposes, tissue and cellular stores of oxygen do not exist. The body is dependent on circulation to bring oxygen to tissues in amounts determined by their metabolic needs.

### Relationship between Oxygen Consumption and Body Temperature

Energy requirements of the body, reflected in part by V O2, are reduced during hypothermia, reflecting dependence of the rate of biochemical reactions on temperature.F30 Quantitative interrelations have been expressed mathematically in various ways (Box 2-1). Some have used a *linear model*. Others, including Harris and colleagues, have used a model based on the *Arrhenius equation,* which states that the logarithm of the rate of a chemical reaction is inversely proportional to the reciprocal of the absolute temperature.H20 The nomogram describing this relationship is S-shaped (similar to the oxygen dissociation curve) such that at high temperatures, the reaction rate ceases increasing with temperature (reaches an asymptote).

At physiologic temperatures, biochemical systems operate only on the upswing of the curve. Thus—particularly when the range of temperatures is relatively small—this relationship finds numeric expression in the *van't Hoff law,* which relates the logarithm of a chemical reaction rate directly to temperature. Conveniently, according to this equation, the reaction rate increases by two to three times for an increase in temperature of 10°C. Chemists use the symbol *Q10* for this multiple.

Because oxygen uptake is the expression of all oxidative reactions, both direct and indirect, the logarithm of V O2 might be expected to be directly proportional to temperature. In general, this appears to be so. Whether the observed decline in V O2 during clinical hypothermia can be accounted for entirely on this physicochemical basis is doubtful, however (see "Oxygen Consumption during Hypothermia in Tissue Slices and Isolated Organs" later in this section).

### Box 2-1 Kinetics of Oxygen Consumption

The relationship of oxygen consumption  $(V_{O_2})$  to perfusion flow rate  $(\dot{Q})$  and temperature (T) is not linear; that is, a unit increase in  $\dot{Q}$  or T does not increment  $V_{O_2}$  a constant amount. A number of formal mathematical models (see Box 6-5 in Chapter 6) have been proposed that relate, in particular, metabolic activity and T based on fundamental thermodynamics. These models provide a good starting point for examining  $V_{O_2}$  data for other empirical relations, such as with blood flow.

### **Arrhenius Equation**

The Arrhenius equation relates reaction rate k to temperature T, the universal gas constant R, activation energy  $E_a$ , and a constant related to molecular collision as:

$$k = Ae^{-\frac{E_a}{RT}}$$

where e is the base of the natural logarithms. If logarithms are taken of both sides of this equation, one obtains the following:

$$\operatorname{Ln}[k] = \operatorname{Ln}[A] - \frac{E_a}{RT}$$

Constants A, R, and  $E_a$  are coalesced (a, b) to obtain a log-inverse equation:

$$\operatorname{Ln}[k] = a - \frac{b}{T}$$

Therefore, one can examine the correlation of the logarithm of oxygen consumption and inverse temperature to see if the data are consistent with this relation.

### van't Hoff Law (Q10)

Another relation is expressed in the van't Hoff law, which is generally formulated in terms of change in metabolic rate (k) per 10°C change in temperature ( $Q_{10}$ ):

$$Q_{10} = \left(\frac{k_1}{k_2}\right)^{\frac{10}{T_1 - T_2}}$$

If  $T_1 - T_2$  is 10°, then  $Q_{10}$  is simply the ratio of  $k_1$  to  $k_2$  (metabolic rates at each temperature). This relation can be derived from the parameter b in the Arrhenius equation.

#### **Hyperbolic Equation**

Metabolic rate (reflected in  $\dot{V}_{O_2}$ ) and  $\dot{Q}$  should be independent until blood flow becomes limiting. This suggests a hyperbolic relation between the two variables:

$$\frac{1}{\dot{V}_{O_2}} = \frac{1}{c} + \frac{d}{\dot{Q}}$$

where c is the asymptotic (limit of  $\dot{V}_{O_2}$ ) value of  $\dot{V}_{O_2}$  as  $\dot{Q}$  becomes large (metabolic rate independent of flow).

#### **Empirical Relations**

Actual data may be better characterized by (1) a linear relation (rare), (2) a log-linear (exponential) relation, (3) a log-log relation, (4) an inverse-log relation, or a more complex relation. Many of these models can be fitted to data using linear regression (see Box 6-5 in Chapter 6) by logarithmic or inverse transformations of scale. Others require iterative nonlinear optimization methods to obtain parametric estimates (see Box 6-14 in Chapter 6).

### Total Body Oxygen Consumption after Surface Cooling

When hypothermia is induced by cooling the surface of anesthetized humans or experimental animals, cooling is rather uniform throughout the body, and temperatures of internal organs and regions differ by less than  $2^{\circ}$ C. Therefore, values for whole-body  $\dot{V}o_2$  at various body temperatures are probably useful, and the relative magnitude of reduction can be assumed to be similar throughout the body.

Good data in this area are available from the animal experiments of Bigelow and colleagues, Ross, and Penrod.  $^{\text{B31,P12,R22}}$  Data for surface cooling in humans are sparse, although Harris estimated  $Q_{10}$  to lie between 1.9 and 4.2 in 10 surface-cooled infants.  $^{\text{H17}}$  The experimental data were reanalyzed using (1) a linear equation, (2) the Arrhenius equation, and (3) the van't Hoff law. The van't Hoff law best fits this combined set of data (Fig. 2-1) and is considered the most appropriate model for this purpose.  $^{\text{B31,P12,R22}}$  This model also best fits the relation between temperature and cerebral oxygen consumption during CPB in humans.  $^{\text{C37}}$ 

Kent and Peirce studied  $\dot{V}o_2$  in experimental animals during hypothermia produced by combined surface and core cooling. K4 Their data are similar to those obtained from surface cooling alone.

# Oxygen Consumption during Hypothermia in Tissue Slices and Isolated Organs

Data from the studies described could lead to an underestimation of true oxygen demand, because only areas in which perfusion of the microcirculation continues can participate in oxygen consumption (tissue and cellular stores of oxygen being trivial). In theory at least, a considerable part of the reduction in oxygen consumption from surface cooling could be from shutting down the microcirculation of portions of the body or from arteriovenous shunting. New technologies, particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may resolve some of these questions. N14,87

Studies of tissue slices at various temperatures show that oxygen consumption is in fact reduced by hypothermia. F12,F29,F31 These studies and those of isolated organs suggest that  $Q_{10}$ , although differing from tissue to tissue, is on average about 2 (for references and a table of  $Q_{10}$  values, see Harris and colleagues<sup>H18</sup>). Measurement of human wholebody Vo<sub>2</sub> before and after heating, rather than cooling, indicates a Q<sub>10</sub> in this same range (≈1.9). S11 Vasodilatation caused by heating presumably ensures access of oxygen to the tissues, and this Q<sub>10</sub> probably represents true tissue oxygen requirement. A Q<sub>10</sub> greater than 1.9 associated with cooling may therefore indicate that oxygen delivery has been compromised by inadequate flow rate. Fuhrman and colleagues have spent many years investigating this possibility. They showed that, in general, there was a close agreement between resting Vo<sub>2</sub> at 37°C and tissue slice respiration. F31,M9 However, rats cooled by immersion to 18°C exhibited a 33% lower Vo<sub>2</sub> than would be expected from studies of tissue slice respiration at this temperature. F12 The discrepancy was not accounted for either by inhomogeneities in whole-body temperature or by known changes in Q<sub>10</sub> exhibited by some tissues (in part related to altered function at reduced temperatures). The precise mechanism remains unknown. It could be due to arteriovenous shunting or to shutting down of perfusion to

some areas of the body. Microvascular physiologists have referred to the latter as a *decrease in effective capillary density*. This may result not only from reduced cardiac output and vasoconstriction but also from changes in blood viscosity, geometry, and compliance of red blood cells, plasma "skimming," and clumping of formed blood elements.

Some studies of tissue slices and isolated perfused organs show a relative reduction of oxygen consumption at any degree of hypothermia that is *greater than* in those of the body as a whole (Table 2-1). This may be related to known

species differences in tissue respiration, suboptimal conditions for tissue respiration in the studies with tissue slices, or increased  $\dot{V}o_2$  during whole-body perfusion caused, for example, by catecholamine release. M9

A striking and important fact from whole-body, tissue, and organ studies is that  $\dot{V}o_2$  is not reduced to near zero at temperatures close to  $0^{\circ}\text{C}$ . H36,M16,R21 Metabolic activity is therefore continuing, and the time limits of safe circulatory arrest must be finite. Furthermore, this continuing metabolic activity causes a tendency for organs and systems to rewarm during

the arrest period. Donald and Kerr showed in dog brains cooled to 1°C to 2°C that an increase in temperature occurred during a 30-minute period of circulatory arrest and that this was in part related to the gradient between brain and room temperature and in part to continuing metabolic activity in the brain.D17

### OTHER PHENOMENA DURING HYPOTHERMIA AND CIRCULATORY ARREST

### No-Reflow Phenomenon

It is only a hypothesis that a numeric relationship exists between V O2 and safe circulatory arrest time at any given temperature. In fact, existence of a necessary and close relationship between the two over a wide range of temperatures would be surprising in view of other phenomena that occur during circulatory arrest. One of these is regional vascular occlusion in the brain and probably in all organs and tissues, leading to the no-reflow phenomenon.A13 This is an obstructive lesion of the microcirculation that prevents local reperfusion and leads to additional damage after the general circulation of blood has been reestablished.

The no-reflow phenomenon could theoretically damage the brain after hypothermic circulatory arrest. However, Norwood and colleagues have shown experimentally that this phenomenon develops as a result of severe hypoxia or anoxia, not because of circulatory arrest per se.N13 They have also shown that hypothermia to 20°C prevents the no-reflow phenomenon from 90 minutes of anoxia produced by continuing perfusion at an arterial PaO2 of about 10 mmHg. Thus, this phenomenon may represent, at least in part, hypoxic endothelial cell injury, with altered expression of endothelial relaxing and constricting factors.K21 In experimental studies, hypoxia followed by reoxygenation results in an almost twofold increase in release by endothelial cells of endothelin-1, the most powerful vasoconstrictor yet identified.G6 Other experimental studies have shown that this response can be blunted when ischemia is induced under hypothermic conditions,Z2 so hypothermia may provide protection against hypoxic endothelial cell injury. Hypoxia may also promote a procoagulant response in endothelial cells that can result in intravascular microthrombosis.G7,S24 Edema, as well as neutrophil and platelet plugging, may also contribute to the impaired perfusion that occurs following ischemia, despite what appears to be adequate restoration of blood flow.B46,R13

### Changes in Plasma Volume

Chen and colleagues demonstrated progressive hemoconcentration and decrease in plasma volume during surface cooling of infants to 25°C, an observation supporting their own and previous experimental studies.C8,D2 This may represent sequestration of plasma in portions of the vascular bed and plasma leakage into the interstitial fluid compartment.

### DAMAGING EFFECTS OF CIRCULATORY ARREST DURING HYPOTHERMIA

It is generally agreed that the brain has the shortest safe circulatory arrest time of any organ or region of the body, although occasionally the kidney seems to be damaged by a period of circulatory arrest when the brain is not. Although other organs and regions can be severely damaged by long periods of circulatory arrest, their safe arrest times are generally longer than that of the brain.

### Brain Function and Structure: Risk Factors for Damage

The possibly damaging effects of circulatory arrest on the brain, as well as the risk factors related to it in patients undergoing cardiac operations during hypothermic circulatory arrest, are incompletely understood. The conduct of cooling and rewarming by CPB and the damaging effects of CPB itself likely contribute to or interact with the injury produced by circulatory arrest per se.

Duration of total arrest of cerebral blood flow is clearly a determinant of the amount of brain damage, but the safe duration of circulatory arrest to the brain (the duration within which irreversible structural or functional damage does not occur) is affected by a few known risk factors and no doubt by other risk factors that are as yet poorly understood. Furthermore, in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, brain damage that occurs in the setting of hypothermic circulatory arrest is rarely diffuse. In adults, it is usually manifested by specific intellectual or motor deficits, whereas in neonates, infants, and small children it is more likely to be manifested by seizures or choreoathetoid movements. This may be related to the phenomenon of *selective neuronal vulnerability,* a heightened sensitivity of specific neuron groups to ischemic injury. This sensitivity has been correlated with the concentration of specific membrane receptors whose density in

specific areas varies with age. G28,R23 Concentration of these receptors is transiently high in the basal ganglia in the neonatal period, which may relate to the appearance of choreoathetosis as a result of ischemic injury in the very young.

Risk factors for irreversible structural and functional brain damage from circulatory arrest, in addition to duration of the arrest, include mean and regional brain temperature during circulatory arrest, rate of cooling and rewarming, cerebral blood flow and distribution during cooling, arterial blood pressure during cooling and reperfusion, electrical activity before arrest, biochemical milieu and catecholamine levels during cooling and circulatory arrest, absence of pharmacologic interventions before and after cessation of cerebral blood flow, and total management of reperfusion.

### Temperature and Duration

Most clinical studies of the relationship of temperature to safety of a given circulatory arrest time are flawed by lack of information about the temperature of the brain itself and by the variety of sites of measurement of temperature (tympanic membrane, nasopharynx, rectum, midesophagus, bladder, extremity skin) used to estimate safety. B62 There is little consistent correlation between some of these sites, although temperature of the tympanic membrane and nasopharynx most closely resembles mean temperature of the brain. C30,G33,W10 For this reason, these sites should be used whenever possible.

Animal experiments and clinical experiences indicate that when the brain is cooled to 15°C to 20°C, *circulatory arrest of 30 minutes or less* is tolerated without development of evident structural or functional damage. F14,F15,F16,K22,R9,T25,W23 During such a period, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations decline to 35% of initial values but return rapidly to normal during reperfusion. K22 Evidence that *circulatory arrest of 45 minutes* at these temperatures is safe is less secure. E16,R9,T25

Considerable information supports the inference that *circulatory arrest of 60 minutes or more* at temperatures of 15°C to 18°C is associated with irreversible structural or functional damage, although it may be tolerated without evident damage by some subjects under some circumstances. In experimental studies by Folkerth and colleagues and Fisk and colleagues, histologic evidence of anoxic brain damage was found in all animals subjected to hypothermic circulatory arrest for 45 to 60 minutes, although some animals survived without evident functional abnormality. F14,F15,F16 Half (2 of 4) of the animals studied by Kramer and colleagues showed no recovery of ATP when subjected to 60 minutes of hypothermic circulatory arrest. K22

Some clinical studies have found few problems associated with 60 minutes or more of hypothermic circulatory arrest. Particularly striking is the experience of Coselli and colleagues, who found no clinical evidence of brain damage attributed to hypothermic circulatory arrest (mean nasopharyngeal temperature 16.9°C; range, 10.1°C-24.1°C) in 56 patients with arrest times ranging from 14 to 109 minutes (median 36 minutes). Comprehensive neuropsychometric studies were not undertaken. Hemiparesis or hemiplegia attributed to cerebral edema developed in 3 of 51 surviving patients (6%; CL 3%-11%). In contrast, Gega and colleagues, in a subsequent study of 394 patients undergoing aortic arch replacement, reported 8 strokes (13%; CL 8.6%-18%) among 61 patients in whom the duration of hypothermic circulatory

![](_page_6_Figure_9.jpeg)

**Figure 2-2** Prevalence of temporary (TE) neurologic dysfunction as a function of duration of circulatory arrest time. (From Ergin and colleagues. <sup>E14</sup>)

arrest exceeded 40 minutes. G4 Only 10 strokes (3.3%; CL 2.3%-4.3%) occurred among the remaining 333 patients with shorter intervals of circulatory arrest.

Temporary neurologic dysfunction (postoperative confusion, agitation, delirium, obtundation, or transient parkinsonism without localizing signs) can occur in up to 20% of survivors of operations on the thoracic aorta in which hypothermic circulatory arrest is used. E14 Incremental risk factors associated with developing this complication are duration of hypothermic circulatory arrest and increasing patient age. E14 Prevalence of temporary neurologic dysfunction increases substantially among patients in whom duration of circulatory arrest exceeds 60 minutes (Fig. 2-2). Although postoperative delirium is not permanent, it can be an important complication. Among a group of patients undergoing pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, circulatory arrest times of greater than 50 minutes were a powerful risk factor for its occurrence. W27

Some evidence supports the concept that continuous perfusion of the brain for 60 or more minutes at low temperature also produces neurologic sequelae in a few patients (see "Evidence of Gross Neurologic Damage"). M27 However, cold (10°C-15°C) continuous perfusion of brains already at 15°C resulted in no intellectual or other deficit in trained rhesus monkeys. W23

#### Characteristics of the Cooling Process

Uneven cooling of the brain is probably a risk factor for brain damage, although evidence is largely indirect. B62 Almond and colleagues conducted experiments in dogs undergoing hypothermic circulatory arrest for 30 minutes. A10 Results were interpreted to indicate structural and functional brain damage when cooling by CPB was done with the perfusate 20°C colder than the patient. These investigators believed that this did not occur when the blood was only 4°C to 6°C cooler than the subject. However, the damage might have been related to the short period of cooling required with the very cold blood, producing uneven brain cooling, as suggested by the work of Zingg and Kantor. The longer period of cooling required with the blood only 4°C to 6°C colder than the subject probably produced more uniform cooling. In their patients, Stewart and colleagues noted a considerably higher

prevalence of major neurologic events after circulatory arrest when core cooling by CPB alone was used, compared with surface cooling first to 28°C, followed by core cooling (Table 2-2).S31 A reasonable presumption is that the more rapid core cooling resulted in uneven cooling of the brain. In another study in neonates and infants, rapid core cooling was associated with more evidence of neurologic deficits after hypothermic circulatory arrest than more prolonged core cooling.B11 Again, a reasonable presumption is that prolonged core cooling results in more uniform cooling of the brain.

#### *Cerebral Blood Flow during Cooling and Rewarming*

The relationship of cerebral blood flow during cooling (before establishing hypothermic circulatory arrest) to safety of the arrest period has received little investigation. The earlier literature suggested that reduced arterial blood pressure during CPB without circulatory arrest contributes to postoperative neurologic dysfunction, presumably because the hypotension resulted in reduced cerebral blood flow,B48,J4,S33,S34 but this possibility now appears less certain (see "Cerebral Blood Flow" under Distribution of Blood Flow in Section II).

More recently, when cerebral blood flow was measured during operations involving hypothermic circulatory arrest in children, Greeley and colleagues observed that patients with increased oxygen extraction before circulatory arrest may be particularly vulnerable to cerebral injury.G27 In a subsequent study, they demonstrated that during cooling, a parallel reduction in cerebral oxygen consumption and cerebral blood flow occurred.G25 However, in three of four patients who were subsequently found to have sustained neurologic injury, oxygen extraction before the period of circulatory arrest was increased, suggesting that cerebral blood flow during this period was inadequate to sustain metabolic requirements. Other studies in children have confirmed the observation that cerebral blood flow generally decreases with temperature during cooling, and that coupling with cerebral metabolism is maintained even at low temperatures when ventilation is managed according to the alpha-stat strategy.G30,H31,V2

Information is available about the magnitude and effect of cerebral blood flow during rewarming. Experimental studies have found that cerebral blood flow is reduced during rewarming after circulatory arrestK10,S35 (Fig. 2-3). With or without circulatory arrest, this phenomenon occurs in humans

Along the horizontal axis is rectal temperature. Break between 37°C and 18°C represents 48 minutes of circulatory arrest (total bilateral carotid artery occlusion) at 18°C (arrest group) or continuing hypothermic perfusion (no arrest group). Note that cerebral blood flow was lower during rewarming in those animals that had total cessation of cerebral blood flow for 48 minutes. (From Kirklin.K10)

during cardiac surgery and may affect outcome.G30 In infants, cerebral blood flow is reduced during rewarming immediately after hypothermic circulatory arrest and after achieving normothermia.G30 Based on measurements of jugular venous oxygen saturation, oxygen delivery appears to be adequate during this period of reduced flow.V3 In a study of 255 adult patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with or without associated cardiac valve replacement, Croughwell and colleagues observed a decline in postoperative cognitive function in 38%.C38 The severity of decline was related to greater arteriovenous oxygen content difference between radial artery and jugular venous blood (CavO2) during rewarming. This increase in oxygen extraction was associated with a low jugular venous oxygen saturation and low cerebral blood flow.

#### *Biochemical Milieu*

Only incomplete information is available in the area of biochemical milieu. It is uncertain whether some variables are actual risk factors or surrogates for the real risk factor. Arterial blood pH and PCO2 during cooling may have important direct effects on brain tissue at the beginning of the period of circulatory arrest, and thereby on outcome, but they also influence cerebral blood flow, and perhaps its distribution, during cooling (see Controlled Variables in Section II). Any effect they may have on neurologic outcome, which is uncertain, could be through either mechanism.

Brunberg and colleagues and Anderson and colleagues suggested that increased tissue glucose, such as is usually present at the beginning of the arrest period, may lead to excessive glycolysis and acidosis during the arrest period, possibly resulting in tissue damage from lactic acid accumulation.A18,B58 This possibility makes it imprudent to use glucose solutions for priming the pump-oxygenator and for intravenous infusion when a period of circulatory arrest is contemplated.

Based on the work of Choi and of Olney and colleagues, evidence has accumulated indicating that the neuroexcitatory amino acids—particularly glutamate, the major transmitter mediating synaptic excitation in the mammalian central nervous system—have potent neurotoxic activity during conditions of depleted cellular energy (e.g., hypoxia, ischemia) when the synaptic reuptake of these amino acids, a highly energy-dependent process, is compromised.C17,O6 Resulting overaccumulation of glutamate leads to excessive excitation of the glutamate receptors, leading to an increase in intracellular calcium and eventual neuronal cell injury and death. This process has been observed in experimental animals after 2 hours of circulatory arrest.R5 Neuronal necrosis is selective and corresponds closely to distribution of excitatory amino acid receptors.R4 The hippocampus, cerebellum, and basal ganglia, which have high concentrations of glutamate receptors, are characteristically most vulnerable to this injury, implying excitation as an underlying mechanism.R4,R5

Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, has been demonstrated experimentally in the neocortex of piglets following hypothermic circulatory arrest for 90 minutes at 19°C.D14 Damaged neurons were observed between 8 and 72 hours after reperfusion. Caspase 3 and caspase 8, the principal cysteine proteases involved in apoptosis, were substantially elevated in these animals compared to control animals (no CPB or CPB without circulatory arrest). ATP levels were similar to those of control animals. Glutamate excitotoxicity secondary to hypothermic circulatory arrest has been shown to mediate neuronal apoptosis as well as necrosis.T29

Fessatidis and colleagues' experimental studies using histopathologic techniques demonstrated that the cerebellum is the most vulnerable area of the brain to prolonged periods (>70 minutes) of hypothermic (15°C) circulatory arrest.F10,F11

### *Electroencephalogram Before Arrest*

Electroencephalographic (EEG) criteria for safe circulatory arrest are conflicting. In a study by Coselli and colleagues, the longest recorded durations of safe circulatory arrest in adults were in situations in which a full formal EEG had recorded *electrocerebral silence* (no electrical activity of cerebral origin at maximal gain, 2 µV · mm<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) for 3 minutes before the arrest.C30 Mean nasopharyngeal temperature at this point was 16.9°C (range, 10.1°C-23.1°C).

In a subsequent study by Stecker and colleagues of 109 adult patients undergoing hypothermic circulatory arrest, electrocerebral silence was achieved at a mean nasopharyngeal temperature of 17.8°C (range, 12.5°C-27.2°C).S28 Using a standardized protocol, this required cooling for a mean of 27.5 minutes (range, 12-50 minutes). Distributions of times to cool to various EEG events are shown in Fig. 2-4. The time to cool to electrocerebral silence was prolonged by high hemoglobin concentration, low arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and slow cooling rates. Only 60% of patients demonstrated electrocerebral silence by either a nasopharyngeal temperature of 18°C or a cooling time of 30 minutes. Although cooling to an end point such as electrocerebral silence provides a more reproducible effect of hypothermia on the nervous system than cooling to a specific temperature (e.g., 12.5°C, which was sufficient to produce electrocerebral silence in all patients in this study), the optimal temperature for circulatory arrest could not be determined.S28

Others have found that in infants and children cooled to a nasopharyngeal temperature of 18.5°C, the EEG was characterized by continuous phasic activity.C25,H13,S10,W11 During cooling, however, there was a gradual disappearance of fast components and an increase in slow components. Occasionally, repetitive rapid discharges occurred. Such reports indicate that when circulatory arrest is established, electrocerebral silence develops after an interval that is inversely related to nasopharyngeal temperature at the beginning of the arrest periodH13,K22 (Fig. 2-5). However, Reilly and colleagues reported persistent EEG activity during circulatory arrest, perhaps reflecting activity in the white matter and cerebellum.R11 This is of interest because of the occasional postoperative occurrence of choreoathetoid movements in humans and high-stepping gaits in experimental animals. These abnormalities may be due in part to uneven brain cooling secondary to regional differences in flow.

When CPB is resumed after circulatory arrest in infants, EEG activity is absent initially and then gradually returns as rewarming proceeds.C25 In general, after 20 to 30 minutes of rewarming, the EEG has returned approximately to its control condition.C25 This latent period between resumption of whole-body perfusion for rewarming and time of return of reasonably normal EEG activity is believed by Weiss and colleagues to be related to the important metabolic (oxygen) debt that develops during the arrest period.W11 This in turn is influenced by brain temperature during arrest and by duration of the arrest. They observed that when circulatory arrest lasted less than 40 minutes, EEG activity always reappeared within less than 20 minutes, whereas longer periods of circulatory arrest were followed by longer and more varied latent periods.W11

In adults, Stecker and colleagues observed that lower nasopharyngeal temperatures at the time of circulatory arrest resulted in a slower return to continuous activity.S29 Prolonged time to recovery of continuous EEG activity and higher temperature at which the EEG first became continuous were associated with increased risk of neurologic injury. Patients who sustained postoperative neurologic injury also had a longer period of circulatory arrest (52 ± 21 minutes) than patients who did not (37 ± 12 minutes) (*P* = .006).

#### *Patient Age*

Although it has been stated that very young patients suffer less brain damage than older patients from hypothermic circulatory arrest, there is little factual support for this concept. Relative to the general population, cognitive, language, and motor performances are importantly reduced at age 4 years in infants younger than 3 months in whom circulatory arrest has been used.B14 In a randomized trial of 171 neonates with D-transposition of the great arteries who had open repair using either hypothermic circulatory arrest or low-flow CPB, the circulatory arrest group at age 4 years had lower motor scores and more speech abnormalities (*P* = .03). They also performed worse on tests of fine motor and visuospatial skills.B14 At 8 years, the circulatory arrest group performed worse on tests of motor function (*P* = .003), speech apraxia (*P* = .01), visual motor tracking (*P* = .01), and phonologic awareness (*P* = .0003) than children in whom low-flow CPB was used.B12 In adults in whom circulatory arrest is used, increasing age is an important predictor of both stroke and

#### Effects of Brain Damage

### *Evidence of Gross Neurologic Damage*

*Choreoathetosis* has occurred early postoperatively in infants and children undergoing hypothermic circulatory arrest.B20,B58,C21,S31 When it occurs, it usually develops 2 to 6 days postoperatively. As time passes, the movements usually lessen in severity. If mild, they disappear completely, but if severe, they or hypotonia may persist. Brunberg and colleagues found no correlation between circulatory arrest time or depth of cooling (between 16°C and 20°C) and development of choreoathetosis.B58 These reports suggest that this specific complication occurs in 1% to 12% of patients and that its residual effects are permanent in some. When choreoathetosis occurs, it is often in the setting of prolonged circulatory arrest.S31

Choreoathetosis has been observed in infants and children subjected to hypothermic CPB without circulatory arrest.D8

There are suggestions that this complication can result from perfusion of the brain with very cold blood for a prolonged period at relatively high flows.B6,B34,D8,E9 This is the basis for the recommendation that arterial temperature not be reduced to less than 15°C.

The cause of choreoathetosis is unclear. Deep hypothermia per se may cause neurologic injury. Egerton and colleagues reported that continuous hypothermic perfusion at 10°C to 12°C produced moderate or severe brain damage, including choreoathetosis, in 10 of 16 patients (63%; CL 46%-77%).E9 Air or particulate embolization to the brain may be a contributing factor. When circulatory arrest is used, choreoathetosis may be related to uneven brain cooling, leading to continued metabolic activity in the white matter and cerebellum (as reported by Reilly and colleaguesR11), and possibly to uneven brain reperfusion related to vascular changes associated with the no-reflow phenomenon.C11,G14,H5,H6,O7 The latter finding lends support to the rationale for using hemodilution during cooling, because absence of red cells in the perfusion used just before circulatory arrest to the brain eliminates the no-reflow phenomenon.A13 Use of the alpha-stat strategy of acid-base balance has also been implicated as a causative factor.J8

*Seizures* have occurred in the early postoperative period in 5% to 10% of patients undergoing hypothermic circulatory arrest.B7,B15,B58,C21,V10 Because seizures are usually transient and followed by uneventful convalescence, they have not been considered major neurologic events. However, in an analysis from the Boston Circulatory Arrest Study involving 171 children with D-transposition of the great arteries, transient postoperative clinical and EEG seizures were associated with worse neurodevelopmental outcomes at ages 1 and 2.5 years, as well as neurologic and MRI-detected abnormalities at age 1 year.R2 At age 4 years, occurrence of perioperative seizures was associated with lower IQ scores (*P* = .01) and increased risk of neurologic abnormalities (odds ratio 8.4, *P* = .05).B14

In a more recent prospective study of 178 neonates and infants less than age 6 months undergoing CPB with or without hypothermic circulatory arrest for a variety of congenital heart defects, including hypoplastic left heart syndrome and other forms of single ventricle, EEG-recorded seizures occurred in 20 patients (11.2%; CL 8.8-14.2%).G3 Patients with duration of circulatory arrest of more than 40 minutes had more seizures (14 of 58, 24%; CL 18%-31%) than those with a duration of 40 minutes or less (4 of 59, 6.8%; CL 3.5%-12%; *P* = .04). Occurrence of seizures among patients with a duration of circulatory arrest of 40 minutes or less was similar among those in whom circulatory arrest was not used (*P* = .38).

The comments concerning possible causes of choreoathetosis are applicable to seizures. However, it is well known that infants are highly susceptible to seizures from other causes, such as disturbances of thermoregulation and fluid balance, as well as from metabolic disorders, especially those related to glucose and calcium, and many of these factors may be operative in these patients.

Severe gross evidence of brain damage occurs uncommonly after hypothermic circulatory arrest in infants and children, including *coma* either dating from surgery or developing some hours later, followed by *lasting impairment or death*. In a study by Stewart and colleagues, 3 (1.4%; CL 0.6%-2.7%) such instances occurred among 218 young patients undergoing repair of the common types of congenital heart

**Figure 2-6** Relationship between probability of freedom from a major postoperative neurologic event and hypothermic circulatory arrest time in 219 infants younger than 3 months of age (8 events) undergoing open intracardiac operations. (See Appendix 2A, Equation 2A-5.) (Data from Stewart and colleagues.S31)

disease with hypothermic circulatory arrest; 5 other patients developed choreoathetosis.S31 All these events occurred in the group of patients in whom core cooling alone was used. None occurred in patients in whom the duration of circulatory arrest was less than 45 minutes, and the probability of developing major neurologic events increased as circulatory arrest time increased beyond this (Fig. 2-6).

Focal neurologic damage resulting in serious neurologic impairment (stroke) occurs in adult patients following hypothermic circulatory arrest. Ergin and colleagues demonstrated that this form of injury is related to older age (*P* < .0001) particularly beyond 60 years, presence of clot or atheroma in the aortic arch (*P* < .0001), as well as longer duration of hypothermic circulatory arrest (*P* < .0001).E14 In the series of adult patients reported by Gega and colleagues in whom hypothermic circulatory arrest was used as the sole means of brain preservation, prevalence of stroke was 13.1% (8 of 61; CL 8.6%-19.1%) among patients in whom the duration of circulatory arrest exceeded 40 minutes.G4 Computed tomographic (CT) scans demonstrated that 62% of these strokes were embolic in origin and 38% were related to hypoperfusion.

#### *Postoperative Intellectual Capacity*

The effect of hypothermic circulatory arrest on late postoperative intellectual capacity and behavior in infants and children has been difficult to study. Problems in testing infants preoperatively so that each may serve as his or her own control contribute to the difficulty. Associated congenital developmental disorders, possible adverse effects before operation of severe congenital heart disease, and effects of other perioperative events complicate interpretation of the data.

Results of psychomotor testing in 146 children undergoing cardiac surgery during hypothermic circulatory arrest early in the experience with this technique, obtained by combining the three largest reported series, are summarized in Table 2-3. C21,D10,S30 Late postoperatively, 23 of the 146 (16%; CL 13%-19%) had an IQ of 80 or less, more than 1 standard deviation below the test mean. In approximately half these patients, preoperative events were considered likely to account for the low scores. In the remainder, an occasional child

suffered an adverse perioperative event, but the low scores were unexplained in nine (6.2%; CL 4.1%-9.0%) patients.

Wells and colleagues obtained data on intellectual and psychological development in children that caused them to question the idea that 60 minutes of circulatory arrest at 18°C is safe.W12 They found that verbal (*P* = .06), quantitative (*P* = .07), and general cognitive (*P* = .003) IQ scores of patients with an arrest time of 50 minutes or more were lower late postoperatively than those of patients with an arrest time of less than 50 minutes.

The first randomized clinical trial comparing prevalence of brain injury after corrective heart surgery in infants with D-transposition of the great arteries using deep hypothermia, predominantly with circulatory arrest or low-flow CPB, was conducted at Boston Children's Hospital.N8 This study demonstrated that infants in whom circulatory arrest was used had a higher prevalence of neurologic abnormalities and poorer mental function at age 1 year, and poorer expressive language and motor development at age 2.5 years. Follow-up studies of the same cohort at age 4 years showed that use of circulatory arrest is associated with worse motor coordination and planning but not with lower IQ or worse overall neurologic status.B14 However, neither IQ nor overall neurologic status was correlated with duration of circulatory arrest. In the cohort as a whole, cognitive, language, and motor performance were reduced relative to the general population.B14

In summary, there is increasing evidence that intervals of hypothermic circulatory arrest of 40 minutes or more are associated with brain injury in infants, children, and adults. Early experience at the Mayo Clinic suggested that 45 minutes was the maximum safe duration even when nasopharyngeal temperature was reduced to 20°C.K11

#### Spinal Cord Function

The spinal cord is less susceptible to ischemic injury than the brain, as evidenced by absence of sensory or motor deficits of the trunk or the upper and lower extremities of infants, children, and adults who have been subjected to intervals of hypothermic circulatory arrest of up to 60 minutes. Hypothermia also provides important protection of the spinal cord during ischemic intervals produced by aortic clamping. In a clinical study of hypothermic CPB and circulatory arrest (mean interval of arrest, 38 minutes; range, 8-62 minutes) for operations on the descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta in 161 patients, prevalence of paraplegia or

paresis (severe injury resulting from spinal cord ischemia) remained constant and less than 3.5% for ischemic (but hypothermic) intervals of up to 138 minutesK20 (Fig. 2-7).

### Renal Function and Structure

#### *Experimental Studies*

At normothermia, at least in rats, 20 minutes of circulatory arrest to the kidney produces no histochemical evidence of cell death, whereas 30 minutes produces extensive cell death in the distal portion of the proximal convoluted tubules, with scattered areas of cell death being seen at 25 minutes.V15 Vogt and Farber identified progressive accumulation of lactic acid during ischemia as a causative factor, and rapid decrease of ATP to 20% of control values as an indicator of impending renal death.V15

Hypothermia prolongs the safe circulatory arrest time for the dog kidney. Ninety minutes of circulatory arrest after surface cooling to 18°C to 20°C produces no late morphologic changes in the kidney,R16 but precise relationships among temperature, duration of circulatory arrest, and morphologic and functional renal damage are not clear. Gowing and Dexter suggest that minimal morphologic changes evolve in the rat kidney after 60 minutes of circulatory arrest at 21°C.G22 It is apparent, however, that at any temperature, the safe circulatory arrest time for the kidney is longer than it is

![](_page_12_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 2-8** Freehand nomogram for the kidney of the relation between probability of safe total circulatory arrest and duration of circulatory arrest at two temperatures. Normothermic relationship is based on the work of Vogt and FarberV15 and the hypothermic one on data presented in the text.

for the brain and shorter than it is for the liver. In addition, a scattered loss of cells through cell death probably results in no detectable loss of renal function, whereas this may not be true in the brain.

As with other organs, the question of damaging effects of hypothermia per se is not fully resolved. Ward found fewer morphologic and functional derangements of the kidney after 90 minutes of circulatory arrest at 15°C than at either lower or higher temperatures.W8 This suggests that temperatures less than 15°C may damage the kidney.

### *Studies in Humans*

Important oliguria beginning about 12 hours postoperatively occasionally complicates recovery of infants operated on with hypothermic circulatory arrest for less than 60 minutes. Venugopal and colleagues reported 4 deaths (3%; CL 2%-6%) from renal failure among 130 patients operated on with surface-induced hypothermic circulatory arrest.V10 Among patients who died, renal failure was the mode of death in 14%.

The primary cause of the renal failure appears to be low cardiac output after operation. However, in at least some cases, severe oliguria develops when the hemodynamic state of the patient appears to be adequate. In view of the finding in experimental studies that morphologic and functional damage to the kidney does not occur after 60 minutes of circulatory arrest at temperatures of 18°C to 20°C (Fig. 2-8), damaging effects from CPB must be implicated. In part, this may be the result of low cardiac output preceding and following the interval of circulatory arrest. In part, it may be due to damage to the kidneys by free hemoglobin and circulating toxins that appear during CPB (see Section II). Free hemoglobin has been found in the renal tubules of some of these patients at autopsy.

In 161 adult patients undergoing resection of the distal aortic arch and descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta in whom hypothermic circulatory arrest was used (mean nasopharyngeal temperature, 14.5°C; mean interval, 38 minutes; longest interval, 62 minutes), prevalence of postoperative renal failure requiring dialysis among 157 operative survivors was 2.6% (4 patients; CL 1.3%-4.6%).K20 Among the subgroup of 18 operative survivors who had evidence of renal dysfunction preoperatively (serum creatinine level > 1.5 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), none developed renal failure that required dialysis.

#### Liver Function

Studies in dogs suggest that complete hepatic circulatory arrest for 45 minutes or more at 37°C is followed by serious functional derangements.A8,B22 The normothermic liver of humans resumes normal function after its complete isolation from the circulation for 35 to 40 minutes.H41 With hypothermia (20°C-22°C), 60 minutes of circulatory arrest does not produce structural or functional abnormalities in the liver.R16

### SAFE DURATION OF CIRCULATORY ARREST

The preceding information does not allow formulation of a table or an equation relating safe duration of circulatory arrest to various temperatures based on rigorously derived rules. Knowledge of biological systems in general indicates that if adequate information were available, relationships should be expressed as probability of no functional or structural damage (i.e., probability of safe circulatory arrest) at a given temperature, rather than as an absolute value.

Fig. 2-9, *A* shows three curves relating probability of safe circulatory arrest to arrest time at nasopharyngeal temperatures of 37°C, 28°C, and 18°C. These estimates are based on available information, but because of lack of data they have not been rigorously derived. To emphasize that each curve would have a degree of uncertainty even if considerable data were available, the 70% confidence limits around the continuous point estimate for 18°C are shown in Fig. 2-9, *B*. The preceding pages indicate that histologic changes in the central nervous system, without functional abnormalities, are the most sensitive indicators of lack of complete safety of the arrest period used. The portrayal at 18°C of essentially complete safety of 30 minutes of circulatory arrest is consistent with all available information. The portrayal of essentially complete safety of arrest of 45 minutes for at least 70% of subjects is also consistent with the facts, and the damage produced within this period is likely to be structural and without permanent functional sequelae. Most patients will have some structural evidence of damage from 60 minutes of arrest, but only about 10% to 20% will have evident functional damage, and in many of them the manifestations will be transient. It remains a vexing clinical problem that the probability of the safe period of circulatory arrest varies widely, especially because state-of-the-art medicine is not yet capable of defining specific patient genetic or phenotypic profiles that

![](_page_13_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 2-9** Probability of safe (absence of structural or functional damage) circulatory arrest according to duration. **A,** Estimate at nasopharyngeal temperatures of 37°C, 28°C, and 18°C. **B,** Estimate at 18°C, with dashed lines representing 70% confidence limits. Number of experiments in the literature concerning 40 minutes of circulatory arrest at 18°C nasopharyngeal temperature is estimated at 20 as a basis for calculating these confidence limits. Note that at 30 minutes, safe arrest is highly likely and that at 45 minutes it is probable. Other data suggest that at 45 minutes, damage will probably be only structural and without evident functional sequelae.

may help identify individual patient vulnerability. The attendant uncertainty is particularly problematic because perfusion strategies other than circulatory arrest are available for essentially all clinical cardiac surgical problems.

Other support systems, such as continuous CPB at normothermia or with moderate or deep hypothermia, with or without low perfusion flow rates, have their own potential for damaging one or more organ systems.H12 It should be kept in mind that the damage uniquely caused by circulatory arrest is likely additive to the damage caused by continuous CPB, because a long period of CPB is required when circulatory arrest is used. Furthermore, the heart disease being treated has the potential for producing damage. An inaccurate repair can produce damage, and such inaccuracies are more likely to result when surgical exposure is poor. The surgical team must therefore weigh the relative risks of these and other factors in deciding whether circulatory arrest should be used for a given patient and, if it is to be used, determining its duration and temperature during the arrest period (see Section III for additional details).

# **Section II Whole-Body Perfusion during Cardiopulmonary Bypass**

CPB for cardiac surgery is conceptually simple, and equipment is available to accomplish it with relative ease. Most or all of the patient's systemic blood, which normally returns to the right atrium, is diverted into a device in which oxygen is supplied to the blood and carbon dioxide is removed. The newly arterialized blood is pumped from the device into the aorta. Among the complexities of CPB are that blood does not naturally (1) circulate through nonendothelially lined channels, (2) contain gaseous and particulate emboli, and (3) experience nonphysiologic shear stresses. Also, the body is unaccustomed to absence of any appreciable pulmonary blood flow and to presence of only minimally pulsatile aortic pressure. In addition to CPB, the patient undergoing cardiac surgery experiences all of the stress responses characteristic of major surgical procedures and trauma.

What is truly remarkable is that most patients survive operation and CPB and convalesce in a reasonably normal manner. For a time, however, almost every patient retains a few demonstrable stigmata from the procedure; some have major morbidity, and a few die of their response to CPB. Prevalence of these unfavorable outcomes in a group of patients is in part determined by identifiable risk factors, but determinants of their occurrence and severity in an individual patient remain incompletely defined.

When essentially all systemic venous blood returns to the pump-oxygenator instead of to the heart, the situation is termed *total cardiopulmonary bypass*. When some systemic venous blood returns to the right atrium and right ventricle and is pumped into the lungs, then passes back into the left atrium and is pumped by the left ventricle into the aorta, the situation is termed *partial cardiopulmonary bypass*. Partial CPB has long been known to be better tolerated than complete CPB. Reasons for this have not been clearly defined, but continuation of at least some pulmonary blood flow is a likely explanation. The remainder of this section is concerned with total CPB.

### HISTORICAL NOTE

The historical aspects of CPB for cardiac surgery are not easily described, because it is almost impossible to determine who first conceived the idea of diverting the circulation of a patient to an oxygenator outside the body and pumping it back to the arterial system to allow surgery to be performed on or within the heart. References to extracorporeal gas exchange in blood go back to the last part of the 19th century. For example, Frey and Gruber worked with an oxygenator in 1885.F24 Subsequently, scores of laboratory studies with oxygenators and pumps were reported. However, serious consideration of pump-oxygenators for cardiac surgery had to await development of modern anesthesia, modern surgical methods, and scientific developments such as discovery and use of heparin and manufacture of biocompatible plastic materials.

Without doubt, John Gibbon, with his pioneering experimental work at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston in the late 1930s, was a major contributor to development of CPB and its advancement to the stage of successful clinical application.G8 Gibbon's work was interrupted by World War II, but when he came to Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia after military service, he resumed work with CPB, its pathophysiology, and the equipment required for it. Most of the medical and surgical world took little note of his work, considering it unlikely to lead to any useful purpose, but Gibbon persevered. In 1953, he performed the first successful operation in which the patient was totally supported by CPB when he repaired an atrial septal defect in a young woman using a pump-oxygenator.G9 Unfortunately, his subsequent four patients died of a variety of problems, and he became discouraged with the method (Gibbon JH Jr: personal communication, 1955).

Meanwhile, a few others began to work with pumpoxygenators for CPB during the late 1940s. Among them were Clarence Dennis and his colleagues at the University of Minnesota. His laboratory studies led him to make what may have been the first attempt to use a pump-oxygenator for clinical cardiac surgery in 1951.D9 Dennis and Richard Varco operated on a patient thought to have an atrial septal defect. These surgeons believed they had done a satisfactory repair, but the patient died. Autopsy showed that the lesion was in fact a partial atrioventricular septal defect, and misinterpretation of the anatomy was a major factor in the patient's death. In Stockholm, Viking Bjork and Åke Senning also worked with CPB during the late 1940s and early 1950s.B33,S9 In related efforts, Clarence Crafoord was an early user of this method for removal of an atrial myxoma.C35

After Dennis's unsuccessful effort, C. Walton Lillehei and his colleagues at the University of Minnesota began working in the laboratory with controlled cross-circulation, using another intact subject as the "oxygenator."C24 Their experimental studies led them to adopt the now discarded "azygos flow principle," which presumed that only low perfusion flow rates were needed.A19 In March 1954, they began a spectacular series of operations in 45 children with congenital heart disease using "controlled cross-circulation" with the mother or father as the oxygenator.W9 A 53-year follow-up of the 28 hospital survivors documented only 8 late deaths, and of the remaining 20 survivors, none was limited by cardiac conditions.M28 Although this particular technique was soon abandoned, the work of Lillehei and colleagues brought into being the modern era of open intracardiac surgery.

Experimental work at the Mayo Clinic with pumpoxygenators began in the early 1950s under the direction of John Kirklin.D16,J10 This led to the first use of CPB with a pump-oxygenator at the Mayo Clinic on March 22, 1955, when a ventricular septal defect was successfully repaired, and subsequently to the world's first published series of intracardiac operations performed with use of CPB and a pump-oxygenator.K12 These procedures were performed using the Mayo-Gibbon pump-oxygenator, which was designed and constructed in the engineering shops of the Mayo Clinic.K8,K9,K10,K13 Use of a pump-oxygenator for CPB during cardiac surgery expanded rapidly, and today the method is used many times a day in hospitals in almost every country in the world.

### UNIQUENESS OF CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS

The patient whose arterial blood flow is temporarily provided by means of a pump-oxygenator is in an abnormal state that affects most if not all physiologic processes. Throughout evolution, blood has passed only through channels lined with endothelial cells, but during CPB, it is passed across nonendothelial foreign surfaces. As a result, and perhaps because of other factors, virtually all humoral and cellular components of the inflammatory response are acutely activated, and probably some of the more slowly reactive specific immune responses are activated as well, at least initially.K8 The general stress response seen after surgery and trauma also occurs to a major degree.

During total CPB, a number of physiologic variables are under direct external control, in contrast to the situation in intact humans. These include total systemic blood flow ("cardiac" output); input pressure waveform; systemic venous pressure; pulmonary venous pressure; hematocrit and chemical composition of the initial perfusate; arterial oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen levels; and temperature of the perfusate and patient.

Another group of variables is determined in part by the externally controlled variables but in large part by the patient. These include systemic vascular resistance, total body oxygen consumption (V O2), mixed venous oxygen levels (PvO2), lactic acidemia and pH, regional and organ blood flow, and organ function.

A third group of largely uncontrolled variables includes, to a greater or lesser degree, all components of the process of inflammation, incited in large part by the organism recognizing the foreign surfaces across which blood passes as "nonself."

These features make the patient who has undergone CPB a unique organism, at least for a few days. Recognition of this, as well as a detailed knowledge of the post-CPB state, is necessary for delivery of optimal postoperative care (see Chapter 5).

### CONTROLLED VARIABLES

#### Arterial Output to the Patient

Arterial output (outflow) from the pump-oxygenator to the subject is achieved by generating a large pressure gradient by a pump. The most commonly used type of arterial pump is the *roller pump* (originally used by DeBakey for blood transfusionD7). It generates a relatively nonpulsatile flow and is simple, reliable, and relatively inexpensive. In clinical use, roller pumps are generally set to be nearly occlusive.1 When they are occlusive, trauma to the formed elements in blood is increased; when they are too nonocclusive, they are unable to maintain the same rate of flow against the wide range of resistances (pressure differentials of 30-300 mmHg) offered by arterial cannulae and the patient's systemic vascular resistance. The tubing passing through the roller pump head is most often Tygon, a special nontoxic surgical grade of polyvinyl chloride. During hypothermia, Tygon tubing decreases in elasticity and filling volume, so stroke volume of the pump is slightly decreased. Silicone rubber tubing does not have this disadvantage and may be used in the roller pump head when hypothermia is required. Volume output of the roller

In the laboratory, this is defined as a fall of 1 inch per minute of a column of water in tubing held vertically above the roller pump. Clinically, when the pumpoxygenator is fully primed, the system is pressurized to 300 mmHg measured by an onboard manometer. The roller heads are adjusted to allow a slight pressure drop over 1 minute.

pump is more certain to be that predicted when output resistance is high than when a high negative pressure is generated on the input side. When generated negative pressure on the input side exceeds about 200 mmHg, volume output of the roller pump becomes less predictable.

The controlled vortex (centrifugal) pump is also commonly used for cardiac surgery and for closed-chest support of patients in whom both arterial and venous cannulation are accomplished centrally or peripherally (termed *cardiopulmonary support* [CPS]). Flow generated by a controlled vortex pump varies with changes in resistance to flow into and out of the pump. When pressure in the output line reaches about 500 mmHg, both outflow from and inflow into the pump become zero. When pressure in the inflow line decreases to about −500 mmHg, both inflow and outflow become zero. Therefore, in contrast to the roller pump, revolutions per minute (rpm) of the controlled vortex pump cannot be used to estimate flow. Instead, a flow meter must be placed on the arterial (output) or venous (input) line. However, if the arterial line becomes completely occluded, either intentionally or by accident, flow immediately ceases, but pressure in the arterial line will rise no higher than 500 mmHg, and it is unlikely that the tubing will rupture or a junction connector will give way. Blood trauma is similar in controlled vortex and roller pumps. Although air can be entrapped within the controlled vortex pump, it, like the roller pump, can transmit air bubbles from the venous to the arterial lines. (However, air entrapped in a vortex pump breaks down into microbubbles that eventually pass out of the pump; a roller pump will pump gross air presented to it.)

### Venous Input from the Patient

The venous input (inflow) into the pump-oxygenator from the patient is achieved by a negative pressure gradient from patient to machine. The negative pressure required to move blood from the patient to the pump-oxygenator is considerably less than the pressure required to move blood from the pump-oxygenator to the patient, because of the different characteristics of the venous and arterial systems of the patient and to some extent of the venous and arterial cannulae.

Sufficient negative pressure for venous input into the pump-oxygenator can be generated by:

- Creating a controlled vacuum within a venous reservoir
- Using a siphon system in which gravity creates the negative pressure
- Using a controlled vortex pump to create the negative pressure within the venous line from the patient

#### *Vacuum-Assisted Venous Return*

The ideal method for creating negative pressure for venous input into the pump-oxygenator is by a regulated and monitored vacuum pressure system coupled to the venous reservoir. The patient and machine can be at or near the same vertical level from the operating room floor, the negative pressure does not rise above the controlled level if the cannula becomes occluded, and the amount of negative pressure can be varied as needed. Most importantly, the two pressures (i.e., output pressure to the patient and input pressure from the patient) are uncoupled and can be varied independently with an arterial roller pump. If a controlled vortex pump is used, the vacuum pressure in the venous system will reduce the outflow pressure of the nonocclusive vortex pump, thus requiring higher rpm to achieve a constant flow.

Use of a hard-shelled venous reservoir in currently available oxygenators and a vacuum regulator connected to wall suction set at −40 to −60 cm H2O has allowed vacuum-assisted venous return (VAVR) to become widely accepted.F25,T23 VAVR permits use of smaller venous cannulae, smaller reservoirs, considerably shorter tubing, and low priming volume. It is of considerable value for cardiac operations performed in infants and through small incisions in children and adults (see Special Situations and Controversies in Section III).O4,T23 In a study by Banbury and colleagues at Cleveland Clinic, VAVR was found to reduce priming volume from 2.0 ± 0.4 L to 1.4 ± 0.4 L (*P* < .0001), increase hematocrit both on bypass and immediately postbypass (*P* < .0001), and reduce use of blood products both intraoperatively and postoperatively from 39% of patients to 19% (*P* = .002).B3

### *Siphon (Gravity) Drainage*

A common method of generating the negative pressure gradient is through siphonage. Disadvantages of this approach include an imposed difference in the levels of patient and pump-oxygenator, the relatively narrow range of negative pressures that can be generated in the operating room by its use, and its interruption by large boluses of air in the venous line. Most importantly, the need for a reservoir increases the filling (priming) volume of the pump-oxygenator. It is, however, simple, reliable, effective, and inexpensive.

### *Venous Pumping*

The controlled vortex pump permits direct pumping from the patient's venous system and is more effective and safer than a roller pump. The potentially large pressure gradient between the tip of the venous cannula and right atrium or venae cavae must be controlled in some way to prevent "fluttering" of their walls around the end of the cannulae. One way of accomplishing this is to use small venous cannulae to impose a considerable resistance between the pump and tip of the cannula, rather than between the tip of the cannula and the patient's venous system. This is fortuitously advantageous in percutaneous peripheral cannulation, because an 18F or 20F venous cannula of some length can be easily passed into the venous system of a normal-sized adult and provides adequate venous drainage. It also facilitates minimally invasive cardiac surgery. By contrast, 28F to 32F catheters are required when gravity drainage is used.

#### Gas Exchange

The device for gas exchange, the oxygenator, is a highly important component of pump-oxygenators. Not only does it regulate tension of gases in the arterial blood emerging from the pump-oxygenator, it is also the largest area of foreign surface blood comes into contact with, and therefore probably the component of the pump-oxygenator where the most blood damage occurs. This contact occurs in the boundary layer of the blood, which is made very large in the oxygenator to facilitate gas exchange. Only a small proportion of the formed and unformed blood elements comes into contact with tubing and pump surfaces.

Gas exchange occurs directly across the blood/gas interface in bubble oxygenators, rotating disk and cylinder oxygenators, and stationary vertical screen oxygenators used in the past. It occurs across a multitude of tiny pores in so-called membrane oxygenators of the hollow-fiber, microporous polypropylene and other types, in which there are still blood/gas interfaces. However, damage to the blood is less in these types of oxygenators than in bubble oxygenators. V8 Only in the true silicone rubber membrane oxygenator of the type devised by Kolobow and colleagues, or the tightly woven microporous polymethylpentene membrane currently used for extended extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, is there no blood/gas interface. K17 This allows CPB to be used for more than 24 hours with reasonable safety.

Because of their efficiency, hollow-fiber and true membrane oxygenators do not depend on minute ventilation (gas flow) to the oxygenator for  $\mathrm{CO}_2$  regulation under most circumstances. Rather, the ventilating gas flow rate and composition are regulated independently. This allows precise regulation of arterial  $\mathrm{PO}_2$  and  $\mathrm{PCO}_2$ .

### Arterial Oxygen Levels

With present-day oxygenators, maintaining  $PaO_2$  at about 250 mmHg is easily accomplished. Higher  $PaO_2$  is unnecessary and theoretically subjects patients to the risk of oxygen toxicity and bubble formation.  $PaO_2$  lower than about 85 mmHg results in a declining arterial oxygen content  $(CaO_2)$  (according to the oxygen dissociation curve of blood) and a corresponding reduction of tissue and mixed venous oxygen levels. Shepard demonstrated that when arterial oxygen saturation  $(SaO_2)$  fell below 65% in dogs undergoing normothermic CPB,  $\dot{V}O_2$  fell, indicating hypoxic cell damage. S12

 $PaO_2$  is related to temperature of the patient, which is related to  $\dot{V}O_2$  (see Fig. 2-1), blood flow rate ( $\dot{Q}$ ), performance of the oxygenator, and, in a complex fashion, to ventilating gas flow rate and composition (see "Gas Exchange," earlier). Reducing the patient's body temperature reduces  $\dot{V}O_2$  and increases  $P\overline{v}O_2$ , resulting in increased  $PaO_2$ . During rewarming by perfusion from the pump-oxygenator, the increasing  $\dot{V}O_2$  and the metabolic debt that has accumulated result in relatively low  $P\overline{v}O_2$ .  $^{T18,T19}$  (Fig. 2-10). This period, then, places maximal demands on the oxygen transfer capacity of the oxygenator.  $^{L11,T19,T20}$ 

### Arterial Carbon Dioxide Pressure

Arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) is controllable during CPB by varying the ratio between gas flow rate into the oxygenator ( $\dot{V}$ , or ventilation · min<sup>-1</sup>) and  $\dot{Q}$  through the oxygenator.<sup>H7</sup> This is facilitated by use of microporous or true membrane oxygenators, because  $\dot{V}$  is not the force driving blood through the oxygenator, as is the case in bubble oxygenators, and PaO<sub>2</sub> is well maintained over a wide range of  $\dot{V}$ . Inline PCO<sub>2</sub> and pH meters facilitate control of PaCO<sub>2</sub> and pH.

Some clinical perfusions for cardiac surgery are performed at normothermia (≈37°C) and others at various levels of hypothermia: mild (30°C-35°C), moderate (25°C-30°C), or deep (<25°C). Therefore, it is necessary to consider the strategy for controlling PaCO₂ and, indirectly, pH. The alphastat strategy is based on (1) using the pH measured at 37°C and uncorrected for the temperature of the patient's blood, and (2) maintaining this level at pH 7.4. That is, the ventilation of the oxygenator is maintained at the level appropriate for a body temperature of 37°C, no matter how low the

**Figure 2-10** Hemoglobin saturation *(top)* and temperature *(bottom)* during rewarming on cardiopulmonary bypass. Note sharp decrease in mixed venous oxygen saturation *(open circles in upper panel)* as rewarming proceeds. "Entering" saturations and temperatures are those in the arterial tubing, and "leaving" saturation and temperatures are those in the venous return tubing. (From Theye and Kirklin.<sup>T18</sup>)

temperature. This hyperventilation during hypothermia results in a decrease in  $PaCO_2$  and an increase in pH when the values for these are corrected for the temperature of the patient's blood. Swan and Reeves and Rahn and colleagues have all emphasized that at low temperatures, neutrality exists at a higher pH than at normothermia, because of the change of the dissociation constant of water with temperature.  $^{R1,R7,R8,S40}$  The alpha-stat strategy results in optimal function of a number of important enzyme systems, including lactate dehydrogenase, phosphofructokinase, and sodium-potassium ATPase.  $^{Y1}$ 

In contrast, the *pH-stat strategy* strives for the same values of pH and PaCO<sub>2</sub>, *corrected to the temperature of the patient's blood*, during hypothermia as at normothermia. This represents a state of respiratory acidosis and hypercarbia. Cerebral blood flow usually increases under these circumstances. This may be considered advantageous in some situations, but so-called luxury perfusion may expose the brain to a larger number of microemboli than would otherwise be the case, and therefore could be disadvantageous. H26,J7

At a cellular enzyme level, the alpha-stat strategy may be preferable, but which is preferable in clinical cardiac surgery in neonates, children, and adults is the subject of continued investigation and debate. The alpha-stat strategy results in a lower PacO<sub>2</sub>, which may adversely affect cerebral blood flow. This may be of particular importance for patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease (e.g., tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia) for whom low PacO<sub>2</sub> may result in pulmonary vasodilatation in addition to cerebral vasoconstriction. Thus, there can be a steal of blood from the cerebral to the pulmonary vascular bed. K14,W26 Several studies in infants suggest that pH-stat management results in superior neurologic outcome during deep hypothermic CPB

and hypothermic circulatory arrest.B13,K14,P11 The pH-stat technique may depress cardiac function.B10 However, at least in dogs, regional distribution of blood flow during normothermic and hypothermic full-flow CPB is similar with the alpha-stat and pH-stat strategies.B45

A recent review of 16 best-evidence published papers concluded that better results were achieved with the alpha-stat technique in adult patients and with the pH-stat technique in pediatric patients.A1

### Heparin Levels

Before CPB is established, the patient is anticoagulated by intravenous or intracardiac injection of heparin, usually in a dose of 300 to 400 units · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> body weight (sometimes expressed as 3 to 4 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ). (Details of dosage of heparin and protamine, and of activated clotting time (ACT), are given later in "Heparinization and Later Protamine Administration" under Preparation for Cardiopulmonary Bypass in Section III). Heparin, one of a heterogeneous group of glycosaminoglycans, has an approximate molecular weight of 3000 to 100,000. It binds to and greatly amplifies the effect of antithrombin III, which is responsible for virtually all of its anticoagulant activity. Currently, a purified form derived from porcine intestinal mucosa is commonly used, whereas the form derived from bovine lung was used more commonly in the past. Experimental and limited prospective clinical studies suggested that lung heparin may be preferable for CPB, because bovine lung heparin has a more reliable protamine neutralization response.S14 However, current supply of heparin in the United States is 100% derived from porcine intestinal mucosa.

Heparin concentrations in plasma can be measured directly; the usual values during CPB are 3.5 to 4 units · mL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . Usually these measurements correlate well with ACT.W24 One exception is the situation of antithrombin III deficiency, a state of heparin resistance.B5,B26 Two or three times the usual dose of heparin may be required to produce satisfactory anticoagulation (i.e., ACT of 480 seconds); if only the heparin level is measured, initiation of CPB might produce thrombosis in the pump-oxygenator system and introduce thrombus into the patient. The most common cause of antithrombin III deficiency is previous exposure to heparin in a dose-dependent fashion.E17,S26 If repeated ACTs indicate an unsafe level for CPB, antithrombin III supplementation must be considered. This is accomplished with either fresh frozen plasma or antithrombin III concentrate.

Although heparin used in the manner described has been clinically satisfactory, activation of the clotting cascade during CPB is not completely neutralized. At least factor XII, factor XI, and prekallikrein are activated, and high-molecular-weight kininogen is cleared.C27 Thus, markers of fibrin formation can be detected in most patients during and early after CPB, and fibrin deposition and embolization can occur.D3 In most patients, this subclinical coagulation does not cause the concentrations of the soluble coagulation factors to become sufficiently low during or early after CPB to cause bleeding.H15

Increasing the dose of heparin does not prevent this subclinical coagulation during CPB,G23 so maintaining ACT at 300 to 350 seconds (rather than 450 seconds) results in no more subclinical plasma coagulation than does the traditional method, requires less heparin, and may be associated with less bleeding after operation.C2,G23 Yet a 2008 survey of 54 cardiac surgery centers in the United States and Canada indicated that the majority of institutions (71% for U.S. and 69% for Canadian sites) used a target ACT for instituting CPB of between 400 and 480 seconds.L18

The former use of aprotinin affected the concepts of heparinization for CPB for intracardiac surgery, because this agent prolongs both clotting time and ACT, depending on the method of measurement (see "Fibrinolytic Cascade" under Details of the Whole-Body Inflammatory Response later in this section).H42,N3,W7 If aprotinin is used, an optimal recommendation is to administer the usual initial dose of heparin and add additional heparin to maintain the ACT above 700 seconds if the activating agent is Celite (diatomaceous earth). Kaolin is a more dependable activating agent, giving ACTs in the presence of aprotinin similar to those without aprotinin in vitro and during CPB.F7,W6 Therefore, a preferable method when aprotinin is used during CPB is to use kaolin as the activating agent and maintain the usual ACT at 480 seconds. Alternatively, the heparin concentration is measured at intervals and kept above 3 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . Because of results of randomized trials demonstrating that aprotinin was associated with a higher risk of death after cardiac surgical procedures than other antifibrinolytic agents used to decrease the need for red blood cell transfusions,F9 Bayer Pharmaceuticals withdrew their drug Trasylol (aprotinin) from the market in May 2008. Subsequent meta-analysisG1 has confirmed higher morbidity and mortality associated with use of aprotinin.2

It has been estimated that 1% to 5% of patients who receive therapeutic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin develop antibodies, with concomitant development of thrombocytopenia defined as HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia).L12 HIT may complicate management of patients who require cardiac surgery using CPB when a large dose of heparin is required. In patients with established or suspected HIT, all heparin must be withheld and alternative forms of anticoagulation used.

Bivalirudin, a synthetic 20-amino-acid peptide analog of hirudin, has become the anticoagulant most commonly used to replace heparin in patients with HIT who require cardiac surgery.C41,L12 A randomized, open label, multi-institution trial comparing bivalirudin (101 patients) with heparin (49

The controversy surrounding aprotinin and its eventual removal from the market provides an interesting yet sobering insight into evidence-based medicine. Aprotinin was introduced for its serine proteinase inhibitory properties, which are relevant to the damaging effects of CPB discussed later in this chapter. Its profound effect on blood loss during cardiac surgery was a serendipitous pleiotropic finding,R25 although this had been observed in cyanotic children with hematologic derangement by Urban and colleaguesU4 and others.H43,K19,P17 What was considered by some an unethical number of small randomized trials repeatedly demonstrated this effect on blood loss.F8 Nevertheless, in a thoughtful assessment, Angoustides and FleisherA25 pointed out that at least three essential issues remained unresolved: (1) safety in specific subsets of patients, (2) platelet protection, and (3) organ protection. For example, many studies, such as those of Koch and colleagues, have demonstrated that morbidity and mortality of cardiac surgery steadily increase with number of transfused red cell unitsK15,K16; yet despite the substantial decrease in transfusion requirement with aprotinin, morbidity did not proportionately decline. It was the observational study of Mangano and colleagues that focused attention on safety of aprotinin despite its efficacy.M5 This study with numerous flaws,S5 combined with another randomized trialF9 and concern about the transparency of reporting of safety by the manufacturer, led to withdrawal of aprotinin from the market.

In developing an evidence base, even randomized trials can be misleading when they (1) focus on efficacy without sufficient power (sample size) to identify possible safety problems; (2) do not compare against placebo, just other drugs of the same class; (3) do not take into account differential effects on different patient subsets; or (4) fail to assess known primary effects of the drug when interesting and unexpected efficacy is discovered. The result is incomplete evidence that clouds decision making.

patients) for operative procedures requiring CPB demonstrated similar procedural safety (freedom from death, Q-wave myocardial infarction, reoperation for coronary artery surgery, or stroke) between the two groups at 7 days, 30 days, and 12 weeks.D26 Secondary end points including mortality, 24-hour blood loss, transfusion requirements, and duration of operation were similar. Avoiding blood stasis was critical for patients receiving bivalirudin. A more recent singleinstitution study of 115 patients receiving bivalirudin during operations requiring CPB demonstrated procedural safety (similarly defined) of 99.4% at 7 days and 30 days.K18 Although specific dosage protocols have not been determined, Czosnowski and colleagues, in a review of available randomized trials and other clinical studies, recommended a 1-mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> bolus followed by a 2.5-mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> infusion (goal: ACT > 2.5 times baseline).C41

### Perfusate

#### *Diluent*

The diluent (which is used to prime the pump-oxygenator system, wholly or in part, and for any erythrocyte-free additions during CPB) is a balanced electrolyte solution with a near-normal pH and an ion content resembling that of plasma. There is some evidence for the concept that in both adults and young patients, it is disadvantageous to include either glucose or lactate in the priming solutionM19,M24 (see "Biochemical Milieu" under Brain Function and Structure: Risk Factors for Damage in Section I). However, priming solutions containing glucose and lactate are used in some centers.M20

In pump-oxygenator systems without a venous reservoir or those using VAVR, mixing of blood and prime may be partially or wholly avoided, with residual prime discarded.

### *Hemoglobin Concentration*

At some institutions, in adult patients and even young patients, no effort is made to control hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit during CPB. Instead, the pump-oxygenator is routinely filled initially with a balanced salt solution.

In intact humans at 37°C, the normal hematocrit of 0.40 to 0.50 is optimal rheologically and for oxygen transport (assuming a normal red blood cell hemoglobin concentration).C13 This provides sufficient oxygen delivery to maintain normal mitochondrial PO2 levels of about 0.05 to 1.0 mmHg, and average intracellular PO2 levels of about 5 mmHg, these being reflected in normal PvO2 of about 40 (SvO2 of about 75%). When the hematocrit is abnormally high, oxygen content is high, but the increased viscosity tends to decrease microcirculatory blood flow. The rate of oxygen transport varies directly with hematocrit (because oxygen content varies directly with hematocrit, assuming normal red blood cell hemoglobin concentrations and adequate oxygenation) and inversely with blood viscosity (which is also determined primarily by hematocrit). Hypothermia increases blood viscosity; therefore, at low temperatures, a lower hematocrit is more appropriate than at 37°C.

A lower-than-normal hematocrit appears desirable during hypothermic CPB because the perfusate has a lower apparent viscosity and low shear rates and provides better perfusion of the microcirculation. Thus, a hematocrit of about 0.20 to 0.25 may be optimal during moderately and deeply hypothermic CPB, although a low hematocrit could predispose the

#### **Box 2-2** Algorithm for Calculating Patient-Machine Hematocrit

The need for and amount of additional packed red blood cells to achieve a desired hemoglobin concentration early after commencing bypass is determined by the patient's blood volume (VpB) and hemoglobin concentration prior to CPB (expressed as hematocrit, HCTp), and the volume of pump-oxygenator prime (VmB) and its hemoglobin concentration (expressed as hematocrit, HCTm). Patient blood volume is estimated as

$$VpB = 1000f \cdot wt$$

where *f* is the proportion of body weight attributable to blood volume; *f* = 0.08 for infants and children up to 12 years of age, *f* = 0.065 for older patients, and *wt* is weight in kg. (These are average values for the proportion of body weight that is blood volume. More complex regression equations are available for more accurate estimates.N1)

Patient (VpRBC) and machine (VmRBC) red cell volumes are:

VpRBC V = ⋅ pB HCTp

VmRBC V = ⋅ mB HCTm

Then, mixed patient-machine hematocrit (HCTpm) is:

HCTpm V = + ( pRBC VmRBC /) ( ) VpB V + mB

If no blood is in the prime:

HCTpm V = pRBC/ V( ) pB + VmB

These calculations may be included in a computer-prepared printout for the perfusionist, available before the patient comes to the operating room.

patient to neurologic dysfunction, particularly when it exists during a period of low CPB flow and also in elderly and diabetic patients with poor cerebral regulation of blood flow. Several studies of infants suggest that a hematocrit of 0.25 is associated with better neurologic outcome than one of 0.20, but that there is no incremental improvement for hematocrit greater than 0.25 (up to 0.35).J9,N7 During rewarming, a higher hematocrit may be desirable because of increased oxygen demands, and the higher apparent viscosity of a higher hematocrit is appropriate during normothermia. This may be achieved by ultrafiltration (see "Components" under Pump-Oxygenator in Section III) or by adding packed red blood cells if the blood volume is too low to allow this.

The need for and amount of additional blood or packed red blood cells to achieve a desired hemoglobin concentration during CPB can be determined before the start of CPB (Box 2-2). If the calculated hematocrit is in the desired range, a blood-free priming solution is used. If the calculated hematocrit is lower than desired, an appropriate amount of blood (or packed red blood cells) is added.

*Banked blood* preferably less than 48 hours old is preferred, but older blood is accepted for adults when necessary. Banked blood is rendered calcium-free by the anticoagulant solution (citrate-phosphate-dextrose [CPD]) and is acidotic, so additions of heparin, calcium, and buffer may be required before placing it in the pump-oxygenator, before or during CPB. However, in at least a few institutions, no calcium is added before placing the blood in the pump-oxygenator, and none is added thereafter until the patient's nasopharyngeal temperature reaches about 28°C during the rewarming process. It is important to monitor the ionized calcium level, and calcium is added if necessary. (The normal level is about 1.2 mmol · L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , with total calcium being about 2.5 mmol · L<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> or 10 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> .) This practice results in extremely low levels of ionized calcium when CPB is first established. Unduly high levels of ionized calcium could be more deleterious (see "Damage from Global Myocardial Ischemia" in Chapter 3). A reasonable practice would be to initially add 3 mL of calcium chloride (10%) rather than 5 mL for each unit of banked blood used, and then add no more until the ionized calcium is measured.

#### *Albumin Concentration*

Concentration of albumin in the mixed patient-machine blood volume, as well as of hemoglobin, is affected by the amount of hemodilution. Theoretically, according to the Starling law of transcapillary fluid exchange (see "Pulmonary Venous Pressure" later in this section), a reduction of albumin and thus of the colloidal osmotic pressure of the plasma accentuates movement of fluid out of the vascular space into the interstitial space. That this occurs is indicated by the work of Cohn and colleagues, who showed that extracellular fluid volume increases more rapidly when hemodilution is used than when it is not.C26

During CPB, microvascular permeability to macromolecules is increasedS21; some of the administered albumin leaks into the interstitial fluid and has an unfavorable effect on the relationships expressed in the Starling law. Homologous albumin may provoke an allergic response, which also increases microvascular permeability and causes leakage of albumin into the interstitial fluid.

These complex interrelations probably explain the failure of a randomized trial to find a favorable effect from adding homologous albumin to the prime in adults.M7 It is not uncommon for cardiac surgical patients, particularly the elderly, to present with low-normal or below-normal albumin levels. Whether albumin concentration should be maintained at normal levels in some special situations such as this remains arguable.

Other colloidal solutions (dextran 40, dextran 70, hydroxyethyl starch) can also be added to the priming solution to attenuate loss of fluid from the intravascular space. However, none of them has been conclusively shown to have a beneficial effect.

### *Other Additives*

Practices vary regarding addition of substances and drugs to the perfusate (by administering them into the priming volume of the pump-oxygenator or patient before CPB, or into the patient or pump-oxygenator during CPB), other than basic balanced salt solution and blood and its required additives.

Use of an *osmotic diuretic* may be advisable. Mannitol (≈0.5 g · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ), a pure osmotic diuretic, can be included as part of the prime. Mannitol also has the advantage of being an effective agent against oxygen free radicals generated during CPB.E13,M2 Glucose (added to the prime of the pumpoxygenator in sufficient quantity to obtain a glucose concentration of about 350 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> in the prime) also produces diuresis. However, its use in the priming volume and its administration during and early after CPB, employing more than moderate hypothermia, may be unwise in view of the strong suggestion that hyperglycemia during cooling and early after hypothermic circulatory arrest increases the probability of brain injury.A18,E10,S16

Administration of a potent diuretic during CPB is generally useful. Incorporating furosemide in the pump prime is practiced by many groups. It may be more advantageous to give it as a bolus in a dose of 1 to 2 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at the start of rewarming, either after an interval of circulatory arrest or moderately or deeply hypothermic CPB.

The *short-acting adrenergic α-receptor blocking agent* phentolamine is capable of antagonizing the vasoconstriction produced by catecholamines and has been shown to produce more uniform body cooling and rewarming and improved tissue perfusion when given during CPB.B52 A bolus of 0.2 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> is administered just after the start of CPB and the initiation of cooling. When circulatory arrest is used, an additional dose of 0.2 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> is administered with the resumption of CPB for rewarming.

Alternatively, the *long-acting adrenergic α-receptor blocking agent* phenoxybenzamine can be used in infants and children to produce total α-blockade for 8 to 10 hours. It is given in a dose of 1 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> about 15 minutes before commencing CPB and at the beginning of rewarming after the period of circulatory arrest.L15 A continuous infusion of nitroprusside during cooling and again during rewarming is preferred to either of these agents by some groups. Nitroprusside reduces arterial blood pressure (by ≈ 25 mmHg), yet maintains cerebral blood flow during moderately hypothermic CPB.R19

Opinions differ about the advisability of routinely administering (or adding to the perfusate) *corticosteroids* and the appropriate agent to use. Available evidence suggests that corticosteroids improve tissue perfusion and lessen the increase in extracellular water that usually accompanies CPB.N9 Although some studies have reported improved clinical status when steroids are given in the manner described, this matter remains controversial.J3 Methylprednisolone in a single dose of 30 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> or dexamethasone in a single dose of 1 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> given at the onset of CPB and not repeated may be advantageous. These agents do not appear to reduce complement activation, but there is evidence to support the hypothesis that they attenuate complement-mediated leukocyte activation, particularly that associated with reperfusion of the heart and lungs in the latter part of CPB.H4,H30,J3,K7,T17 In piglets, corticosteroids provide brain protection during operations that involve hypothermic CPB and circulatory arrest.L2,S15

The powerful *antifibrinolytic agent* aprotinin is a biological product that acts as a serine proteinase inhibitor. It may have a favorable effect on some platelet membranespecific receptors, specifically GPIb. Aprotinin has been shown in several randomized studies to reduce bleeding after CPB by about 50%,B27,B28,F20,F28,R24,V6,V7,W17 but as mentioned previously, the drug is no longer available for use during cardiac surgical procedures. ε-Aminocaproic acid (EACA) and tranexamic acid are two other antifibrinolytic agents that can be administered before, during, and after CPB to reduce bleeding and the need for allogeneic blood transfusions.B55,C4,G29,L4,L9,M3,M32,N15,T3 EACA is administered using an empirical dose of 10 g before the skin incision, 10 g during the procedure, and 10 g early postoperatively.V5

Alternatively, it can be given at a dose of 150 mg  $\cdot$  kg<sup>-1</sup> at the time of the skin incision, with an additional 30 mg  $\cdot$  kg<sup>-1</sup> for 4 hours upon initiation of CPB. <sup>B19</sup> Tranexamic acid is given at a dose of 1 g before the skin incision, 500 mg in the pump prime, and 400 mg  $\cdot$  h<sup>-1</sup> during the procedure. <sup>C4</sup>

### Changes during Cardiopulmonary Bypass

During CPB for cardiac surgery, blood loss in the operative field and gradual increase in interstitial fluid and urinary output combine to steadily deplete the patient-machine blood volume. Usual practice is for the perfusionist to add increments of a balanced electrolyte solution to maintain the volume at a safe level; in adults, up to 2000 mL may be added. Unless special precautions are taken, such as avoiding return of irrigating fluids to the pump-oxygenator by cardiotomy pump suckers and using ultrafiltration during the final stages of CPB, severe hemodilution results and persists into the postbypass period.

In neonates and infants, ultrafiltration immediately after CPB (before removal of cannulae) is often advisable using the modified ultrafiltration (MUF) technique introduced by Elliot. Ell Its efficacy has been confirmed by others. D1,T21 In children and adults, ultrafiltration may be performed during the latter part of CPB if the hematocrit is below about 0.25 and there is excess volume in the pump-oxygenator. If not, it may be performed after discontinuing CPB, slowly circulating blood through the patient before any cannulae are removed. A third option, and one that is frequently used, is ultrafiltration of the volume remaining in the pump-oxygenator after CPB is discontinued and the venous cannulae have been removed. Hemoconcentrated pumpoxygenator volume is then infused slowly into the patient before the arterial cannula is removed (see Pump-Oxygenator in Section III).

### Total Systemic Blood Flow

Although total CPB has generally been considered to require two separate caval cannulae and occlusive tapes around each cannula, a single large, properly designed, and properly positioned venous cannula can direct all venous return to the pump-oxygenator and provide total CPB.

During total CPB, systemic blood flow (perfusion flow rate) is controlled by the perfusionist. It can be set at an arbitrary level or may be kept equal to the venous return from the patient. A rational approach is to set it at an arbitrary level.

In clinical practice, when body temperature is at 28°C or greater, a flow of 2.5 L · min<sup>-1</sup> · m<sup>-2</sup> is usually chosen for infants and children younger than about age 4 years, and a flow of 2.2  $\,L\cdot min^{-1}\cdot m^{-2}$  for older patients. For adults with a body surface area of 2.0 m<sup>2</sup> or more, a flow of 1.8 to 2.0 L  $\cdot$  min<sup>-1</sup> · m<sup>-2</sup> may be chosen to avoid the disadvantage of high flow through the oxygenator. When moderate hypothermia is chosen, the CPB flow can safely be reduced to about 1.7 L  $\cdot$  min<sup>-1</sup>  $\cdot$  m<sup>-2</sup> for prolonged periods (Fig. 2-11). When cardiac operations are performed with body temperature reduced to 18°C to 20°C in neonates, infants, or adults, CPB flows of 1 L · min<sup>-1</sup> · m<sup>-2</sup> are adequate for prolonged periods, at least as judged by persistence of the somatosensory evoked response (SSER) under these circumstances. W21 Flows as low as  $0.5 \text{ L} \cdot \text{min}^{-1} \cdot \text{m}^{-2} (20-30 \text{ mL} \cdot \text{min}^{-1} \cdot \text{kg}^{-1})$  have been shown to be adequate at these temperatures to maintain

### Box 2-3 Mixed Venous Oxygen Levels

Mixed venous oxygen saturation ( $S\overline{v}o_2$ ), mixed venous oxygen pressure ( $P\overline{v}o_2$ ), and mixed venous oxygen content ( $C\overline{v}o_2$ ) may all be used to express mixed venous oxygen levels. The equation is:

$$C\overline{v}o_2 = 1.38 \cdot S\overline{v}o_2 \cdot [Hb] + P\overline{v}o_2 \cdot 0.003$$

where  $C\overline{v}o_2$  is in mL · dL<sup>-1</sup>, [Hb] is hemoglobin concentration in g · dL<sup>-1</sup>,  $S\overline{v}o_2$  is a decimal fraction, and  $P\overline{v}o_2$  is in mmHg.

cerebral oxygen consumption and ATP levels for at least 30 to 60 minutes.  $^{\rm F19,M25,R3,S39}$ 

When flow rates are lower than optimal for more than a short time,  $\dot{V}o_2$  is considerably subnormal (<85% of the asymptote of the temperature-specific curve in Fig. 2-11 is considered subnormal), primarily as a result of perfusion of less than the total capillary bed. Also, the areas of the capillary bed that are open are underperfused, resulting in lactic acidemia and metabolic acidosis.

 $P\overline{\nu}o_2$  and saturation  $(S\overline{\nu}o_2)$  have been widely used as indices of adequate perfusion flow rate (see Box 2-3; for references, see Harris and colleagues^H19), the assumption being that these values reflect average cellular  $Po_2$ . If  $\dot{Q}$  is high and the entire microcirculation perfused, this is true. However, it has been shown that during CPB, with  $\dot{Q}$  within the conventional range,  $S\overline{\nu}o_2$  is inversely related to  $\dot{V}o_2$ . H19 This might have been predicted from the Fick equation:

$$\dot{V}o_2 = \dot{Q} \left( Cao_2 - C\overline{v}o_2 \right)$$
 (2-1)

where  $CaO_2$  is arterial oxygen content,  $C\overline{\nu}o_2$  is mixed venous oxygen content, and  $\dot{Q}$  is flow rate.

If  $Vo_2$  and  $CaO_2$  are fixed,  $C\overline{v}o_2$  increases with Q. If instead Q and  $CaO_2$  are fixed,  $C\overline{v}o_2$  increases as  $Vo_2$  decreases, and  $Vo_2$  may decrease, despite a perfectly adequate Q, if the capillary bed is not evenly perfused. In this case, the distance between perfused capillaries and many tissue cells increases, and these cells do not obtain their oxygen

requirement. In effect, this amounts to a shunt of arterial blood into the venous system. This effective shunt may at times amount to half the total flow. Rudy and colleagues, using microspheres in normothermic rhesus monkeys during CPB, found that shunting was only 1.4% of total  $\dot{Q}$ . R26

A high  $P\overline{\nu}o_2$  or  $S\overline{\nu}o_2$  does not, therefore, mean that cellular oxygenation is satisfactory whatever the  $\dot{Q}$ . A  $\dot{V}o_2$  at or near the whole-body requirement does. The  $\dot{V}o_2$  is not difficult to calculate during CPB; the problem is, rather, to decide what the oxygen requirement is in a given case. H19,H20 Moreover, if  $\dot{V}o_2$  is less than the usual levels at conventional  $\dot{Q}$ , increasing  $\dot{Q}$  probably will not increase  $\dot{V}o_2$  (see Fig. 2-11). The fault is not in  $\dot{Q}$  but in the capillary bed or at the cellular level.

As might be expected, high  $\dot{Q}$  is achieved at the expense of some loss of safety and convenience in other variables. Blood trauma in the oxygenator is probably greater when high blood flows pass through it. With a bubble oxygenator, risks of gaseous emboli are also greater. Pressure gradients across the arterial cannula are greater at high  $\dot{Q}$ . This increases cavitation, blood trauma, and the risk of bubbles forming as blood emerges from the cannula.

#### Arterial Pressure Waveform

CPB is usually conducted in such a manner that the arterial pressure pulse is very narrow and essentially nonpulsatile, but if desired, a pulsatile arterial input can be achieved in several ways. One is by using left ventricular ejection. With no tapes around the caval cannulae, arterial flow to the patient may be temporarily increased over venous return, or venous return may be temporarily reduced by partially occluding the venous tubing. Atrial pressures and thus ventricular filling pressures are increased, left ventricular ejection augments systemic blood flow, and a somewhat pulsatile arterial blood flow results. In other words, pulsation is achieved by partial CPB. This mechanism is used during cooling and rewarming whenever cardiac action is sufficiently vigorous to prevent overdistention of the heart during the process. The procedure of partial CPB produces not only some arterial pressure pulsations but some pulmonary blood flow as well, with its favorable effect.

A pulsatile waveform can also be produced by using intraaortic balloon pumping during bypass. P8 A third method is to use a pulsatile arterial pump.

Effects on the organism of using a system that results in a pulsatile rather than nonpulsatile arterial waveform during CPB have been questioned since the beginning of clinical CPB. An already complex problem is still further complicated by an almost universal failure to describe the energy of the pulsatile flow in a proper manner, such as by *energy-equivalent pressure*. S13

Intuitively, pulsatile flow seems advantageous over nonpulsatile flow. Several physiologic studies lend strong support to this idea, demonstrating that with nonpulsatile flow, vascular resistance increases, red blood cells aggregate, renal function is impaired, renin is released, and cellular hypoxia leads to metabolic acidosis. G5,G15,M6,W18 It is not clearly established that pulsatile flow during CPB results in fewer functional derangements than nonpulsatile flow. A number of studies have concluded that pulsatile perfusion is beneficial, but not all of them present convincing evidence, and several have found little or no

 $benefit.^{A26,B32,D21,H1,J2,M1,N6,N11,S19,S20,T12,T14,T15,T26,T27,W15,W28}\ Extensive\ reviews\ of\ this\ subject\ have\ been\ presented.^{H28,M13}$ 

A randomized clinical study by Singh and colleagues investigated pulsatile versus nonpulsatile flow during moderately hypothermic (25°C-30°C) CPB. S19 No statistically significant differences between the two techniques were found in wholebody Vo<sub>2</sub>, blood lactate concentration, systemic vascular resistance, urine flow, or thermal gradients. Thus, no evidence was found that pulsatile flow improved perfusion of the microcirculation during clinical CPB. It is possible that pulsatile flow would result in fewer functional derangements at lower flows than were used in this study. D21,N5,O3,S12 Bixler and colleagues found that nonpulsatile perfusion of a hypertrophied fibrillating dog's heart at a mean pressure of 50 mmHg resulted in subendocardial ischemia, whereas pulsatile flow did not. B32 When the mean perfusion pressure was 80 mmHg, neither pulsatile nor nonpulsatile flow resulted in subendocardial ischemia.

It is also possible, but not proven, that pulsatile flow has an advantage over nonpulsatile flow in infants. Williams and colleagues drew this conclusion from a clinical study in which they found more rapid cooling and rewarming and greater urine flow with pulsatile flow. W19 Results of this study are difficult to interpret, however. Finally, pulsatile flow could prove beneficial in high-risk patients who come to operation desperately ill with end-stage disease (low cardiac output, acidosis, or renal failure). H39

Currently, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that pulsatile flow from the pump-oxygenator importantly reduces the ill effects of the relatively short periods of CPB required for cardiac surgery in the great majority of patients.

### Systemic Venous Pressure

During CPB, systemic venous pressure is determined by the techniques used, K13 because:

$$P\overline{v} = f \frac{\dot{Q}, viscosity}{Cannula size, venous tubing size, venous negative pressure}$$
 (2-2)

where  $P\overline{\nu}$  is mean systemic venous pressure,  $\dot{Q}$  is systemic blood flow rate, and f means "a function of." The cross-sectional area and length of the single or multiple venous cannulae, and to a lesser extent (because it usually has a large diameter) those of the venous tubing, are fixed factors determining venous pressure during total CPB. For this reason, the largest venous cannulae compatible with the clinical situation are commonly used, mindful of the need for the cannulae to lie loosely, not snugly, in the caval veins. When smaller cannulae are used, the other variables in Equation 2-2 can be manipulated. For example, systemic blood flow can be reduced or suction applied to the venous return to ensure an acceptable venous pressure (see "Vacuum-Assisted Venous Return," earlier).

There is no apparent physiologic advantage in having a central venous pressure greater than zero during total CPB. Increasing the venous pressure requires more intravascular volume and often additional priming volume. Venous pressure should therefore be kept close to zero, and certainly not more than 10 mmHg, to minimize increases in extracellular fluid.

### Pulmonary Venous Pressure

Ideally, pulmonary venous pressure should be at zero during total CPB, and certainly not more than 10 mmHg. Undue elevations are dangerous because they produce increased extravascular lung water and eventually gross pulmonary edema, according to the Starling law of transcapillary fluid exchange (neglecting lymph flow):

$$P_c - P_t = \pi_c - \pi_t \tag{2-3}$$

where *Pc* is effective blood pressure within the capillary, *Pt* is tissue turgor pressure (interstitial fluid pressure), *πc* is osmotic pressure of the plasma (colloid) inside the capillary, and *πt* is osmotic pressure of the extracellular fluid (tissue colloid osmotic pressure).

Increase in extracellular lung water is related to duration of elevation of pulmonary venous or pulmonary capillary pressure, other things being equal. Not only can pulmonary edema result, but a combination of the damaging effects of CPB and increased pulmonary venous pressure can lead to pulmonary hemorrhage. Maintaining a very low pulmonary venous pressure will not always eliminate these complications.

Maintenance of a low pulmonary venous pressure can be ensured by monitoring left atrial pressure in patients undergoing CPB (see Section III). In most clinical settings, there is little tendency for pulmonary venous pressure to increase. If it does, the pulmonary venous system can be decompressed by suction on either a catheter (or an opening) in the pulmonary trunk, because no valves are present in pulmonary veins, or a catheter inside the left atrium or left ventricle.

#### Temperature

Since the introduction by Brown and colleagues of an efficient heat exchanger for extracorporeal circulation, temperature of the perfusate, and secondarily of the patient, has been controlled by the perfusionist.B54 In decisions regarding temperature of the patient during CPB, several facts must be considered. Flexibility of CPB is achieved when it is combined with hypothermia. Hypothermia of even moderate degree appears to blunt some of the damaging effects of CPB.M30,T1 It allows use of lower pump Q with less blood trauma and achieves better myocardial protection and protection of other organs than normothermic CPB.C1 Systemic hypothermia also provides a margin of safety for organ protection if equipment failure occurs. The patient's body temperature is the most important determinant of the length of safe circulatory arrest time (see Section I).

Moderate hypothermia is used in many patients, and we consider at least mild hypothermia (31°C-34°C) to be advisable in essentially all cases. A nasopharyngeal temperature of 14°C to 20°C is chosen when circulatory arrest is required.

During core cooling, blood entering the patient's aorta should be kept no greater than 10°C to 14°C below the nasopharyngeal temperature to minimize the tendency for gas to come out of solution when the cold blood is warmed by the patient. This is a conservative recommendation, in that some groups use the coldest perfusate temperature obtainable (4°C-5°C) once CPB is initiated.

Because blood is damaged by temperatures greater than 42°C, and the boundary layer of blood next to the wall surface of the heat exchanger probably reaches the temperature of that surface and thus of the water on the other side of the wall, water temperature should not exceed 42°C during rewarming. Blood temperature should not exceed 39.5°C during rewarming. Solubility of gas in blood is decreased when blood is warmed, but this is not a problem when the heat exchanger is upstream (proximal) to the oxygenator. When it is downstream (distal) to the oxygenator, it is a potential problem during rewarming, and a bubble trap may be interposed in the arterial tubing downstream to both. In general, maintenance of a temperature gradient from the heat exchanger to the blood of not more than 10°C to 12°C will prevent bubble formation.

### RESPONSE VARIABLES

Alberts and colleagues state in their textbook: "There is a paradox in the growth of scientific knowledge. As information accumulates in ever more intimidating quantities, disconnected facts and impenetrable mysteries give way to rational explanations, and simplicity emerges from chaos. The essential principles of a subject gradually come into focus."A7 The patient response to CPB using current techniques and equipment is still largely described by "disconnected facts and impenetrable mysteries," but considerable effort has been made to develop simplicity and reduce chaos. Continued interest in this response has stimulated the search for more cohesive knowledge and ways of minimizing unfavorable outcomes of cardiac surgery using CPB and whole-body perfusion from a pump-oxygenator.

Unfavorable aspects of the response of the patient to CPB and use of a pump-oxygenator were evident during the early days of open cardiac surgery, but tended to be overlooked in the excitement generated by this new technology. Subsequently, surgeons observed that (1) diffuse bleeding was more common with CPB than after other types of surgery; (2) some patients, particularly small ones, became edematous during the procedure; (3) occasionally severe and truly malignant hyperthermia occurred with no demonstrable infection; (4) pulmonary dysfunction was sometimes unexpectedly prominent; and (5) the heart often did not perform as well as anticipated after its repair. Yet they also noted that many patients appeared to be free of these developments, and most survived. Since then, more information has been gathered, but not as much as is desirable.

### Whole-Body (Nonspecific) Inflammatory Response to Use of a Pump-Oxygenator

Diversion of blood through nonendothelialized channels to, through, and from pumps and the oxygenator appears to stimulate the organism to recognize the extracorporeal system as nonself. Thus, potential is present for the specific immune and nonspecific inflammatory response systems to be activated. Specific immune responses of an immunologically naive (unprepared) patient are slow to develop and not in evidence during the first few days after CPB. In any event, they are generally not strong. Nonspecific inflammatory responses appear rapidly, and in a few patients they dominate the early minutes, hours, and days after use of a pumpoxygenator. We initially named this response the *whole-body inflammatory response,* which we hypothesized unified the many diffuse responses to exposure of blood to abnormal events.B35 It is now often called the *systemic inflammatory*  *response syndrome* (SIRS) because processes other than CPB can stimulate it.

### *Humoral Response*

Initial response is probably humoral, initiated by the contact of plasma with the foreign surfaces of the tubing and pumpoxygenator and with air. Gas exchange requires a large surface area; it is therefore in the oxygenator that the greatest stimulus to this response occurs. Humoral response appears to begin with activation of specialized plasma proteins, developed and conditioned through centuries of life to recognize and repel transcutaneous invaders. Whereas previously this invasion has generally been a relatively small, localized, and often extravascular process, in the patient exposed to a pumpoxygenator it is a massive intravascular process. Even though the patient is heparinized, parts of the coagulation cascade respond virtually immediately to the activating capability of the foreign surface, as do the complement, kallikrein, fibrinolytic, and other cascades. Activation of Hageman factor (factor XII) may be the initial event in activation of these cascades, although platelets appear to be independently activated at about the same time. Nearly all the split products resulting from these multiple activations can be found in the patient's blood during and, for a time, after bypass. Mechanisms for their disappearance have not been elucidated, but presumably they are to some extent metabolized, taken up by specific cell-surface receptors, dissipated into extravascular fluids, including peritoneal and pleural fluids, and excreted in the urine.

Products of activation of these cascades have powerful physiologic effects, both directly and by activation of other systems and cells. The *complement cascade,* once activated, results in the production of powerful *anaphylatoxins* (C3a and C5a) that increase vascular permeability, cause smooth muscle contraction, mediate leukocyte chemotaxis, and facilitate neutrophil aggregation and enzyme release.G17,H40 Complement activation occurs through either the classic or the alternative pathway.

Contact activation of Hageman factor also immediately initiates the *kallikrein-bradykinin cascade,* resulting in the production of bradykinin. Plasma kallikrein circulates in the blood as a precursor, *prekallikrein,* 75% of which is bound to high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK) in the plasma. Bradykinin, formed largely from HMWK, increases vascular permeability, dilates arterioles, initiates smooth muscle contraction, and elicits pain. Kallikrein also activates Hageman factor and plasminogen to form plasmin, again demonstrating the complex interactions and feedback loops between the various reactions of blood to nonself.

Once activated, the contact activation system overcomes its normal regulating system, and all the responses are amplified. Because plasma kallikrein leads to conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, whose basic function in the circulation is to digest fibrin clots and thrombi, the fibrinolytic cascade is activated by this and other humoral and cellular mechanisms.

### *Cellular Response*

Blood cells and endothelial cells participate in the nonspecific inflammatory response to use of a pump-oxygenator. Lymphocytes (both antibody-forming B cells and T cells) are part of the specific immune system and, as indicated earlier, participate little in the response to CPB in the usual immunologically naive patient. Eosinophilic granulocytes also seem to have limited participation. Basophilic granulocytes (mast cells) may well participate, but the extent to which they do so is not clear, and the same is true of the natural killer (NK) cells within the leukocyte family. Monocytes, once activated, participate in the cellular response.

*Neutrophilic granulocytes* (polymorphonuclear leukocytes) play a major role in the response to CPB. Neutrophils are activated by complement and other soluble inflammatory mediators. When activated, they migrate directionally toward areas of higher complement concentration (usually in the tissues, but during CPB, probably in blood), change their shape, become more adhesive, and secrete cytotoxic substances, including oxygen-derived free radicals. Of importance—and possibly a clue as to why most patients recover uneventfully from cardiac operations in which CPB is used, despite the strong humoral and cellular response—is the fact that complement can also desensitize neutrophils, thereby reducing their ability to participate in the inflammatory response.D20 Neutrophils are also activated by other humoral agents participating in the cascades in the blood, including kallikrein, as well as by other inflammatory mediators (cytokines) generated by cells, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and platelet activating factor (PAF). These molecules also have been shown to increase in amounts both during and early after CPB.

*Platelets* are strongly affected by CPB using a pumpoxygenator, but in a complex manner that has been well summarized by Edmunds and colleagues.E1,E4 As in the case of neutrophils, platelets must be activated from their normally passive state; this occurs within 1 minute of the start of CPB. The precise initial trigger is uncertain, but possibilities include direct surface contact, abnormal shear stresses, mechanical lysis, exposure to adenosine diphosphate, and unidentified chemical agonists. The mechanism for activation of platelets is exposure on the surface of the platelet of numerous specific membrane receptors. Exposure of the fibrinogen glycoprotein receptors (GPIIb-IIIa complex), and subsequent binding of fibrinogen to them, are essential for adherence of platelets to the foreign surfaces of the pump-oxygenator and for their aggregation. Many other specific receptor sites are expressed and exposed by activated platelets. Control, feedback, and amplification mechanisms regulate platelets as well as the humoral systems, all of which are involved in the response to CPB.

*Endothelial cells* do not pass through the pump-oxygenator, but their complex activities are affected while the patient is connected to it. Triggering mechanisms are not clearly defined, but they probably include abnormal pressures and shear stresses, localized ischemia, and increased concentrations of normal and abnormal substances and cells in the blood. As a result, endothelial surface receptors are exposed, substances are elaborated and extruded, and spaces between the endothelial cells and their membranes are enlarged.B47,S6,V11

*Endothelial and other cells,* particularly those in the locally ischemic areas that surely exist during CPB, express phospholipid molecules derived from arachidonic acid (eicosanoids). These are important mediators of inflammation and include the prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and lipoxins. Other cells in areas of acute inflammation that may be present during CPB can produce soluble factors (cytokines) that normally act on other cells to regulate their function; after CPB, they can induce elevation of body temperature, among other things.

### *Metabolic Response*

Magnitude of the acute elevation of catecholamine levels in the blood that develops during CPB (see "Catecholamine Response" later in this section) is a measure of severity of the stress reaction induced by most cardiac surgery using CPB. Thus, in addition to the responses induced by CPB, cardiac operations and CPB induce the important perturbations associated with other major operations and trauma. Characteristics of this "metabolic response to stress" have been intensively studied by a number of investigators and clinicians. Among the first was Cuthbertson in 1930,C40 and among the most prominent, Francis D. Moore.M29 The essence of this process has been well summarized by WilmoreW20:

*The human body responds to these stresses with dramatic resilience. For example, following injury, clotting mechanisms are immediately activated to reduce blood loss; body fluids shift from the extravascular compartment to restore blood volume; blood flow is redistributed to ensure perfusion of vital organs; and respiratory and renal functions compensate to maintain acid-base neutrality and body fluid tonicity. Following these acute adaptations, other changes occur; these responses are more gradual and prolonged but are apparently necessary for recovery of the injured organism. A variety of immunologic alterations are initiated; leukocytes are mobilized, macrophages and specialized T cells are produced, and "acute phase" plasma proteins are synthesized by the liver. Inflammatory cells invade the injured area, set up a perimeter defense, and engulf the dead and dying cells and other wound contaminants. These initial steps are followed rapidly by ingrowth of blood vessels, appearance of fibroblasts that build collagen scaffolding, and a host of other local changes that aid wound repair.*

*Local changes that occur at the injury site are accompanied by systemic alterations in body physiology and metabolism. Cardiac output is elevated, minute ventilation is increased, and the patient becomes febrile. Lipolysis and skeletal muscle proteolysis are accelerated, providing an ongoing fuel supply and an immediate source of amino acids that are utilized for wound healing and synthesis of "acute phase" proteins and new glucose. The glucose provides essential energy for the brain and other vital organs and for healing of the wound.*

Phenomena associated with CPB not only produce their own damage but also interfere with the metabolic response to stress, a process necessary for recovery. Uneventful recovery of most patients after cardiac surgery means that a vast array of control and counteractive phenomena of both humoral and cellular types is in place, many of which await discovery and exploitation.

### Details of the Whole-Body Inflammatory Response

### *Neutrophil Activation*

During CPB, an initial mild leukopenia develops, which soon returns to baseline values.K24 Similar changes occur without an oxygenator in the system and are in part the result of transient movement of leukocytes out of the vascular system.K25 By the end of CPB, leukocytosis is present, consisting primarily of mature segmented forms of neutrophils (coming primarily from the bone marrow, most of which are activated).Q1,R15 Leukocyte count often increases to a peak of 12,000 to 24,000 cells · mL<sup>−</sup><sup>3</sup> at 24 to 28 hours postoperatively. Both T and B lymphocytes are decreased early after CPB, and T-cell function is decreased.R15

Pulmonary sequestration of neutrophils occurs during CPB.C10 An inflammatory response follows their disruption and release of proteolytic and vasoactive substances and powerful lysosomal enzymes, contributing to the increased vascular permeability associated with CPB (see "Complement Activation" later in this section).A4,S21 Also, activation of neutrophils during CPB by the C3a and C5a complement fragments liberates oxygen-derived free radicals; this contributes to the damaging effects of CPB.E13,T28 Neutrophil elastase, a connective tissue protease and product of neutrophil activation that appears in plasma, is considerably increased by CPB, and the peak concentration correlates positively and closely with the duration of CPB.H32 Such proteases break down elastin, collagen, and fibronectin, destroying extracellular structures, and contribute to the capillary leak that leads to postoperative extracellular volume overload and electrolyte imbalance.F4

Neutrophils in healthy persons are distinct cells. By inference, these cells are inactive and unprepared for the numerous deleterious effects they exert during and early after CPB. However, when stimulated, neutrophils transiently aggregate and cluster with each other and to other cell types, such as vascular endothelial cells.P10,R27 The process of aggregation and clustering is rapid, mediated by cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), and a critical step in development of inflammatory and immune responses. In myocardial infarction, anti-CAM antibodies of specific types, which can be produced by monoclonal techniques and can attenuate or prevent neutrophil aggregation and clustering, have been shown to considerably reduce the extent of cell death produced by ischemia and reperfusion.S17

Gillinov and colleagues used the anti-inflammatory agent NPC15669 to inhibit neutrophil adhesion in a CPB model and found a marked decrease in pulmonary injury.G12

Nifedipine, infused during CPB in doses of about 6 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · h<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , appears to inhibit neutrophil activation.R15 Hypothermia has been shown to delay, though not prevent, the expression of neutrophil adherence molecules.J6,L6 Other interventions that have been evaluated clinically and experimentally to reduce the adverse effects of neutrophil activation include leukocyte filtration and pharmacologic agents (aprotinin, oligosaccharide antagonists, antioxidants, corticosteroids, and omega-3 fatty acids).B47,C39,E18,M18,P7,S17,S18,T8

#### *Platelet Response*

In vitro test circuits show that the platelet count (corrected for dilution) decreases within 2 minutes of the beginning of extracorporeal circulation to about 80% of the pre-CPB level. By 8 minutes, the count has decreased to about 70% of the pre-CPB level and then stays close to that level during the rest of CPB and the period therafter.Z4 Decrease in platelet count during clinical CPB tends to be greater than this because of hemodilution.H24 Cardiotomy sucker systems substantially reduce platelet count.E7 Interestingly, membrane oxygenators are associated with greater reduction than bubble oxygenators.C19,E5 As a result of these and other factors, the number of platelets in circulating blood post CPB decreases to about 60% of the prebypass value and does not correlate with duration of CPB.A5,F26, H15,K2

Sequestration of platelets in the liver and other organs during CPB in humans is slight and therefore not a major factor in reducing the platelet count.H37 Something other than mere loss of platelets by adhesion to foreign surfaces is involved, because the platelet count continues to be low in some patients for as long as 72 hours postoperatively. One factor may be reduced survival time of platelets after CPB.H37 Shear stresses likely do not reduce either the number or function of platelets.A2,S22,T4

More complex and probably more important than the change in numbers are qualitative changes that occur in the platelets of patients undergoing CPB. Normally, platelets adhere only to cut ends of blood vessels and to subendothelial surfaces (presumably because subendothelial collagen causes them to adhere). Once CPB begins, platelets almost immediately adhere to foreign (nonendothelial) surfaces.B2,D23 Once this process begins, platelets also begin to clump (aggregate), primarily on the foreign surfaces they have already adhered to.D24 There is some evidence that initial aggregation is in small clumps (primary aggregates) capable of deaggregating. If the stimulus is strong, however, these primary aggregates are transformed into larger aggregates. It is believed that only then do platelets begin to release the contents of their granules and become irreversibly activated.A3,Z4 Aggregates break off on occasion and become particulate emboli. Either platelets aggregate and disaggregate for many days after CPB, or the aggregates formed during CPB persist in the circulation, because platelet aggregates can be seen passing through the retinal vessels of patients for days after cardiac surgery with CPB.

As blood circulates normally through endothelially lined tubes, platelets are generally inactive. The stimulus to platelet adherence and aggregation on the surfaces of the pumpoxygenator system, whatever it may be, also activates the platelets, a process that changes their form and internal architecture. This activation causes platelets to expose or assemble specific membrane receptors on their surfaces—for example, membrane glycoproteins IIb and IIIa (which bind fibrinogen) and GPIb (which binds von Willebrand factor)—with a resultant cascade of further platelet adherence to the foreign surfaces and aggregation.G16 The activation process simultaneously affects platelet granules, which are concentrations of selectively sequestered intraplatelet substances. These substances include (1) serotonin, ATP, adenosine diphosphate, pyrophosphate, and calcium in the "dense bodies"; (2) α1 antitrypsin, β-thromboglobulin, platelet factor 4, and plateletderived growth factor; and (3) lysosomes. When activated, prostaglandin synthesis (arachidonic acid cascade) and other reactions take place in the surface membrane of the platelet as well as within it and lead to external secretion of the highly reactive components of the platelet granules. The entire process may well contribute to a number of the damaging effects of CPB.

As is usual in the humoral and cellular cascades, the same processes that lead to platelet activation lead virtually simultaneously to processes that inhibit it. This proceeds because platelets, like most cells in humans, contain adenylate cyclase, which converts ATP to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This conversion is greatly stimulated by products of the arachidonic acid cascade, which is known to be accelerated by CPB. In sufficient amounts, cAMP leads to inhibition of platelet adhesion, aggregation, change of shape, and secretion. This is part of the normal autoregulatory process, but it may be abnormally amplified during CPB.

Although platelet adherence to the foreign surfaces of the pump-oxygenator is the initial feature of the platelet response to CPB, and is surely accompanied by other major and complex responses, there remains a degree of uncertainty about subsequent events. There are even doubts as to whether platelet depletion and dysfunction are the primary causes of the bleeding tendency usually present after cardiac surgery. In any event, a short time after the first few minutes of CPB, about 60% of circulating platelets have a normal smooth discoid form, as do about 80% 8 minutes after the start of CPB and at the end of CPB.Z4 The implication is that either these platelets have never been activated (because they have just been released into the bloodstream or because foreign surfaces of the pump-oxygenator, passivated by absorption and denaturation of fibrinogen and albumin, no longer activate plateletsA2,P2,S3), or they have been reversibly activated and returned to an inactive state. The latter is supported by the work of Zilla and colleagues but is contested by Edmunds.E1,Z4 Sufficient irreversible activation occurs that partially degranulated platelets, platelets with damaged membranes, and platelet fragments can be recovered both during and at the end of CPB, along with a large number of normalappearing platelets.E1,W14 Thus, by the end of CPB, platelet aggregability is reduced by 60% and bleeding time is prolonged, abnormalities that may persist more than 24 hours.Z3

Most events during CPB that profoundly depress platelet function appear to take place initially in platelet membranes. During CPB, there appears to be a loss or inactivation of the functionally important glycoprotein-specific surface receptor sites.M35,W1,W14 It is possible that abnormal shear stresses are partly responsible.Z3 The GPIb receptor (to which plasma von Willebrand factor must bind for platelet adhesion) is markedly reduced shortly after the onset of CPB and remains low throughout bypass (Fig. 2-12). The GPIIb and IIIa receptors

**Figure 2-12** GPIb antigen on platelet membrane from patients on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), untreated (placebo) *(closed circles)*, and treated with aprotinin *(closed squares)*.

(which bind fibrinogen in a process that leads to platelet aggregation in the presence of extracellular calcium) are markedly reduced by the end of CPB.M35,W14 Other changes in the platelet membranes may occur. Zilla has postulated, as have others, that the key to preventing loss of platelet function during CPB, and therefore to preventing the sometimes strong bleeding tendency associated with cardiac surgery, is to avert loss of action of platelet membrane-specific receptor glycoproteins.Z3

Whatever the mechanisms and despite the high probability that development of platelet abnormalities is inherent in CPB as it is currently used, these alterations can be favorably influenced. The true membrane oxygenator, made from silicone rubber, appears to cause less platelet (and erythrocyte) damage than occurs with bubble oxygenators.B42 Aprotinin, no longer available for clinical CPB, may further lessen the development of platelet abnormalities (see Fig. 2-12 and "Other Additives," earlier).

### *Complement Activation*

Complement is a group of circulating glycoproteins that function as part of the body's response to various kinds of injury such as traumatic, immunologic, or foreign-body insults.J1 The complement system can be activated upon contact of blood with nonbiological surfaces, perhaps by way of Hageman factor, but other substances (e.g., thrombin, plasmin) can also activate it.

Complement activation during CPB was reported by Hairston, Parker, and Hammerschmidt and their colleagues.H3,H10,P9 Complement consumption during CPB was demonstrated by Chiu and Samson.C16 Chenoweth and colleagues identified C3a, a complement breakdown product, in blood shortly after commencing CPB for cardiac surgery, and found that its continuing production was directly related to body temperature and perfusion flow rate.C10 The result is that more than 50% of patients have serum C3a levels above 1000 ng · mL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> at the end of operation with CPB (Fig. 2-13). Complement activation has also been demonstrated to occur

![](_page_26_Figure_7.jpeg)

**Figure 2-13** C3a levels at end of cardiopulmonary bypass, expressed in a cumulative percentile plot. Steep vertical (blue) line on the left represents closed cases, 100% of which had near-normal or normal levels. Curve on the right (red line) represents open cases, virtually all of which had increased levels. Fifty percent of patients had levels greater than 1000 ng · mL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , and 25% had levels greater than 1600 ng · mL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . (From Kirklin and colleagues.K7)

during hemodialysis from exposure of blood to the dialysis membrane.A9,C33,C34 Complement activation in this setting is through the alternative pathway, with depletion of C3 but not C1.C33,C34 During CPB, activation is also through the alternative pathway.C19,K6 Further complement activation by the classic pathway occurs after administration of protamine at the end of CPBK6; this may add to the whole-body inflammatory response in some patients.N12

Recent studies suggest that complement activation after CABG with CPB is biphasic, with a second phase occurring between 8 and 48 hours postoperatively.B57,H34 The second phase appears to be activated by the classical pathway, not by the alternative pathway.H34 Bruins and colleagues demonstrated that higher peak levels of C4b/c on the second postoperative day correlated with increased occurrence of arrhythmia.B57

Magnitude of complement activation is affected by several factors that probably interact with still other factors in complex ways.V12,V13 The nature of the foreign surface has some effect; nylon is apparently a particularly potent complement activator.C10 True membrane oxygenators are weaker activators of complement than bubble oxygenators.C5 Duration of CPB has a weak positive effect on the final level of C3a, but administration of protamine has a considerably stronger effect.C5,C6,K6 Pretreatment of the patient with methylprednisolone or other steroids may decrease the amount of complement activation.C5

Adverse effects of complement activation relate to depletion of a component (complement) necessary for normal immune response and to adverse effects of the intravascular production of anaphylatoxins (C5a and C3a). Hairston and colleagues showed a decreased ability of postbypass serum to inhibit the growth of certain bacteria and related this in part to complement depletion.H3 Adverse effects of anaphylatoxins probably account for the degree of complement activation as a risk factor for morbidity after clinical CPB (Table 2-4, Fig. 2-14).

Pulmonary sequestration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and neutropenia have been shown to develop during hemodialysis and to be temporally related to complement activation.C34 Similar observations have been made during CPB (see "Neutrophil Activation," earlier).C10,W22 That these changes are functionally significant is evident from the increased alveolar-arterial oxygen difference that develops during hemodialysis and after CPB, and from the pulmonary edema observed after CPB.C33 Activation of complement has

been shown to be directly involved in production of pulmonary edema.E8 These findings suggest that neutrophilmediated pulmonary endothelial injury (see "Cellular Response," earlier) and increased lung vascular permeability, perhaps also mediated by reactive oxygen metabolites, may contribute to the adverse effects of CPB on pulmonary function.P13 Similar sequestrations may take place in other organs.

That important complement activation is dependent on a large proportion of blood in the boundary layer (e.g., in an oxygenator or hemodialysis coil) is evident from the demonstration in sheep that a simple venovenous shunt produces no adverse effects on white blood cells, platelets, or pulmonary artery pressure. Addition of an oxygenator to the circuit results in a decrease in circulating white blood cells and in platelets (presumably from pulmonary sequestration) and in a marked increase in pulmonary artery pressure. Fountain and colleagues showed that infusion of complement-activated plasma produces the same result.F17

### *Kallikrein-Bradykinin Activation*

Another humoral amplification system involves kallikrein and bradykinin. Several studies have shown important amounts of bradykinin to be present during CPB.E12,F27,P6 Hypothermia itself apparently results in production of bradykinin. Immaturity, such as is present in young infants, results in less effective elimination of bradykinin.F27 Exclusion of the pulmonary circulation probably also reduces the ability of the organism to cope with circulating bradykinin, because the lungs are the main site of bradykinin elimination. Bradykinin, a small peptide, is a powerful vasodilator, and this effect is probably important in the overall response of the organism to CPB.

Nagaoka and Katori demonstrated a reduction in peripheral resistance and in fluid requirement during CPB accompanied by the administration of aprotinin.N2 This agent is known to neutralize the kallikrein-bradykinin system.

#### *Coagulation Cascade*

Coagulation, the formation of fibrin clots, is largely inhibited by heparin during CPB (see "Heparin Levels," earlier under Controlled Variables), but the coagulation cascade is in part activated. Related or unrelated to this, coagulation is often defective for a period of time *after* CPB.

Normally, in the presence of damaged endothelium or an exposed subendothelium, platelets and soluble components of the coagulation cascade are activated. Through the *contact phase, intrinsic phase,* and *extrinsic phase* of activation, prothrombin is converted to thrombin, which acts on fibrinogen to produce fibrin monomers that polymerize spontaneously to form a fibrin clot. Were CPB to be started in a nonheparinized patient, the contact phase and intrinsic phase would be rapidly activated, and within a short time the pumpoxygenator would be filled with clot.

Because of the incomplete blockade of the coagulation cascade by heparin, small amounts of fibrin form even during routine CPB.D3 Many of the soluble coagulation factors are mildly reduced by the end of CPB.H15 Most authorities believe these changes are insufficient by themselves to be responsible for the bleeding tendency following CPB.

### *Fibrinolytic Cascade*

The fibrinolytic cascade, another humoral amplification system, is probably activated to some degree in all operations in which CPB is used. Important hyperfibrinolysis was shown to be present in 159 (20%) of 774 patients undergoing CABG.L1

Naturally occurring inactive plasminogen (normally incorporated within thrombi) is transformed into the active fibrinolytic agent plasmin under certain circumstances, and measurable blood plasmin levels have been demonstrated in patients shortly after initiation of CPB.B1 Because conversion of plasminogen to plasmin is facilitated by kallikrein, which also results from activation of Hageman factor, the fibrinolytic cascade may be initiated during CPB by activation of factor XII. However, extrinsic plasminogen activator expressed by endothelial cells has been shown to be the major stimulant for conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, and thus for the fibrinolytic cascade.S32 A reasonable explanation for this behavior of endothelial cells during CPB is the abnormally high levels of such substances as catecholamines, bradykinins, and other molecules that are generated.S32

Because plasmin also serves as an activator of complement, prekallikrein, and possibly Hageman factor, the intravascular activation of plasminogen into plasmin (which in intact humans is usually a localized phenomenon) may continue to stimulate cascades of all the humoral amplification systems. Breakdown products of fibrinogen (produced to some extent by the coagulation cascade during CPB), when acted upon by plasmin, have been shown experimentally to lead to important pulmonary dysfunction. This is another example of the powerful effects of the intravascular occurrence of events that are usually localized and extravascular in intact humans.

For a time, it was conventional wisdom that excessive bleeding after CPB was primarily the result of platelet depletion and dysfunction.H15 More recently, several lines of information strongly suggest that activation of the fibrinolytic cascade also contributes importantly to postoperative bleeding after cardiac surgery in which CPB is used.B28,H35,V4,W24 One of these is the favorable effect of aprotinin on bleeding, with most reports indicating a 50% reduction in bleeding after CPB when this drug is administered.B28,B36,E6,H14,H22 However, its action is probably not limited to the antifibrinolytic effect of inhibition of plasmin. Plasmin itself appears to cause platelet aggregation, and its inhibition by aprotinin could therefore favorably affect platelets as well as fibrinolysis. <sup>E6</sup>

#### Arachidonic Acid Cascade

The completely cellular arachidonic acid cascade is activated by a disturbance of cell membranes, which in turn activates phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>. This releases arachidonic acid from the phospholipid fraction of cells, but the arachidonic acid can also come from intracellular lipid pools. The cascade proceeds through the prostaglandin-endoperoxide (cyclooxygenase) pathway. Stationary, migrating, and intravascular cells are susceptible to the arachidonic acid cascade and liberate the active products, which exhibit a short half-life.

The lung, bypassed during CPB, is a major site of synthesis, release, and degradation of eicosanoids (products of the arachidonic acid cascade), although not necessarily the cellular source of those compounds. Prostacyclin and prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) production appears to be sharply increased shortly after CPB is begun, but later when CPB becomes partial and some blood again passes through the lung, levels decrease. F3 By contrast, thromboxane B<sub>2</sub> production (thromboxane B<sub>2</sub> is a stable metabolite of thromboxane A<sub>2</sub>) becomes apparent and reaches peak levels when total CPB becomes partial as the lungs again are perfused. F3 Many researchers believe that most of the thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> comes from platelets, even though release occurs to a great extent in the lungs. PAF, another product of the cascade, appears to be an important mediator of inflammation. D13

Leukotriene B<sub>4</sub>, a product of the arachidonic cascade that promotes plasma leakage and leukocyte adhesion, is also increased during and for a time after CPB.<sup>J3</sup>

Details and overall effects of activation of the arachidonic acid cascade during CPB are not completely understood, but there is at least evidence that the magnitude of the release of both of these eicosanoids during CPB is greatest in the very young.  $^{\rm G24}$  The activation releases agents that are somewhat counteracting, including the vasoconstricting agent thromboxane  $A_2$ , a PAF, and the vasodilating and platelet-inhibiting factors prostacyclin and PGE<sub>2</sub>.

#### Cytokines

Cytokines are soluble factors elaborated by cells of the immune system (e.g., T-cell lymphocytes) that normally act on other cells to regulate their function. During CPB, cytokines such as the interleukins (ILs) elaborate other mediators of the inflammatory process (e.g., TNF, leukocyte adhesion molecules, PAF), which in turn continue the process.

IL-1 is an intracellular derivative of stimulated mononuclear phagocytes and a mediator of fever, changes in endothelial cell function and permeability, and decreased vascular resistance. Its concentration in monocytes is increased during CPB and again 24 hours later. A positive correlation has been found between intracellular IL-1 activity and the patient's temperature 24 hours after CPB. The interrelation between complement activation (which activates monocytes), prostaglandins (which also mediate IL-1 production), and IL-1 illustrates the complexity of the whole-body inflammatory response to CPB and the problems inherent in efforts to prevent its damaging effects.

IL-6 and IL-8 levels rapidly increase after initiation of CPB.  $^{\rm D25}$  Degree of cytokine response appears to correlate with duration of CPB and aortic clamping.  $^{\rm H23}$ 

### Other Mediators of Inflammation

TNF is released by activated monocytes (and macrophages) and is increased in many patients in the later stages of CPB and during subsequent hours.<sup>J3</sup> It is known to increase endothelial cell permeability and open interendothelial cell spaces, thereby promoting development of interstitial edema.<sup>B23,B51</sup>

Endotoxin, a powerful stimulant of complement and endothelial activation, is also a potent agonist of release of TNF from macrophages and is elevated in some patients after CPB. B46,B63,F13,F23,H23,K1 Endotoxin release may be the result of translocation of bacteria from the gut as the result of splanchnic ischemia and possibly impaired function of Kupffer cells in the liver. T2

#### Protein Denaturation

Proteins are denatured by a blood/gas interface, such as in a bubble or stationary vertical film oxygenator, but are denatured considerably less in microporous and true membrane oxygenators.<sup>L7</sup> Denaturation of albumin has a nonspecific effect, but denaturation of immunoglobulins yields degradation products that activate the complement cascade.<sup>T5</sup>

### Oxygen Consumption

### Total Body Oxygen Consumption

Theoretically, total body  $\dot{V}o_2$  during CPB at normothermia (37°C) should be that of an intact human under anesthesia, if all parts of the microcirculation are perfused. Yet, in two studies in humans,  $\dot{V}o_2$  during normothermic CPB at flows of 1.8 to 2.4 L  $\cdot$  min<sup>-1</sup>  $\cdot$  m<sup>-2</sup> was highly variable. Values of 74 to 162 mL  $\cdot$  min<sup>-1</sup>  $\cdot$  m<sup>-2</sup> were found in one study<sup>M26</sup>; in the other study, which consisted of 12 patients, mean  $\pm$  standard deviation of  $\dot{V}o_2$  was  $131 \pm 20$  L  $\cdot$  min<sup>-1</sup>  $\cdot$  m<sup>-2</sup>. L11

A combined analysis of experimental studies in animals during normothermic CPB<sup>C9,P5,S27</sup> indicates a best-fit hyperbolic relationship between the perfusion  $\dot{Q}$  and  $\dot{V}o_2$  (Fig. 2-15).  $\dot{Q}$  in these studies was expressed in L · min<sup>-1</sup> · m<sup>-2</sup>. (These units were not used in the excellent study of Andersen and Senning, nor could the data be recalculated in these terms, hence their exclusion. <sup>A17</sup>) The following linear regression equation was derived from the data:

$$\dot{V}_{O_2} = 0.4437 \cdot (\dot{Q} - 62.7) + 71.6$$
 (2-4)

where  $\dot{V}o_2$  is oxygen consumption expressed as a percentage of measured control value before bypass, and  $\dot{Q}$  is flow from the pump-oxygenator, expressed as mL · kg<sup>-1</sup> · min<sup>-1</sup> (correlation coefficient = 0.83). Andersen and Senning noted, however, that  $\dot{Q}$  and  $\dot{V}o_2$  must meet at zero and that the control value for  $\dot{V}o_2$  was usually reached at high flows (100-125 mL · kg<sup>-1</sup> · min<sup>-1</sup>). Also Visual observation of their scattergram suggests that the hyperbolic model derived from the combined analysis fits their data and ideas well.

Temperature of the patient is also related to  $\dot{V}o_2$  during CPB, as it is in intact, anesthetized, nonshivering subjects. Harris and colleagues were first to express mathematically the interrelation among  $\dot{Q}$ , temperature, and  $\dot{V}o_2$ , but their data covered a narrow range of temperature. Complete data of the type desired are not available. Using the experimental data at 37°C just described and the relation of  $\dot{V}o_2$  to flow at 20°C measured during CPB in humans, a multivariable

Figure contains two depictions. One is a scattergram of data from animal experiments (n=213) performed at about 37°C by Cheng and colleagues<sup>C9</sup> (n=33), Paneth and colleagues<sup>P5</sup> (n=60), and Starr<sup>S27</sup> (n=120). Note that scatter of data increases as flow increases. Second depiction is solid and dashed lines (presented as in Fig. 2-1), which is a solution of the hyperbolic equation (Appendix Equation 2A-2) derived from these data. The hyperbolic equation is chosen because the correlation coefficient, r, was .69, whereas it was .39, .54, and .52 for the linear equation,  $^{S27}$  log-log equation,  $^{H20}$  and Arrhenius equation,  $^{P5}$  respectively.

equation and nomogram have been developed (see Fig. 2-11) portraying the relations of  $\dot{V}o_2$  to flow at various temperatures.

Pulsatility of the arterial input does not affect  $\dot{V}o_2$ , at least during flow rates greater than about 1.4 L  $\cdot$  min<sup>-1</sup>  $\cdot$  m<sup>-2</sup>, nor does the strategy (pH-stat vs. alpha-stat) of managing the acid-base balance. Other factors that may affect  $\dot{V}o_2$  include amount of developed pericapillary edema and amount and type of catecholamine release.

### Cerebral Oxygen Consumption

Cerebral oxygen consumption is important during CPB, particularly hypothermic CPB at low flow, because cerebral  $\dot{V}o_2$  that is reduced below the usual (normal) value at a given temperature implies incomplete or uneven cerebral perfusion (decreased effective capillary density). An equation has been developed from the data of Croughwell and colleagues that appears to be the best expression available of the normal relation during CPB at full flow (2.0 L min<sup>-1</sup> · m<sup>-2</sup>) between cerebral  $\dot{V}o_2$  and temperature during CPB. It is presumably applicable to all ages<sup>C37</sup> (Fig. 2-16). Assuming that cerebral oxygen consumption at 37°C before CPB is the same as that at 37°C during CPB is inappropriate, because whole-body  $\dot{V}o_2$  on CPB is a little less than off CPB. This may be from presumed uneven perfusion on CPB.

Cerebral oxygen consumption does not appear to change with the variations in cerebral blood flow that occur during clinical CPB.  $^{\rm F18,523}$  This is consistent with findings in experimental studies. For example, Fox and colleagues found that in monkeys on CPB at 20°C, cerebral oxygen consumption was the same at CPB flow rates of 0.5 and 1.6 L  $\cdot$  min $^{-1}$  · m $^{-2}$ , even though cerebral blood flow at 0.5 was 50% of that at 1.6.  $^{\rm F19}$ 

### Mixed Venous Oxygen Levels

Although mixed venous oxygen levels are related to the controlled variables of  $\dot{Q}$ , hemoglobin concentration of the perfusate, and Pao as expressed by the Fick equation (see Equation 2-1), they are also related to the patient's response in terms of  $\dot{V}o_2$  and thus to some partially controllable variables that affect  $\dot{V}o_2$ , such as pH and 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid levels in red blood cells. S41

When most of the microcirculation is known to be perfused,  $P\overline{v}o_2$  levels reflect the mean value for tissue oxygen levels. Thus, the assumption can be made that when  $P\overline{v}o_2$  levels during CPB are relatively normal ( $P\overline{v}o_2$ , 30-40 mmHg;  $S\overline{v}o_2$ , 60%-70%) and  $\dot{V}o_2$  is relatively normal, tissue oxygen levels are relatively normal, and the whole-body perfusion is meeting the patient's metabolic demands (see "Total Systemic Blood Flow," earlier under Controlled Variables).

#### Metabolic Acid-Base Status

Metabolic acidosis tends to develop during CPB, even when apparently adequate flow rates are used. This is probably related to uneven distribution of flow during CPB, with the consequent development of underperfused areas that release lactic acid. Resultant metabolic acidosis is usually not severe, and the concentration of lactic acid rarely exceeds 5 mmol  $\cdot$  L $^{-1}$ . H18

#### Hemolysis

Hemolysis of red blood cells during CPB has long been recognized. During the early years of open heart surgery, plasma hemoglobin levels during and after operation were monitored

**Figure 2-16** Relation between body temperature (nasopharyngeal) and cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2) during full flow (2 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m2 ) cardiopulmonary bypass, which is presumed to be applicable to all ages. The equation (van't Hoff) is:

as an index of damage caused by the pump-oxygenator. However, serum hemoglobin levels during clinical CPB do not accurately reflect the amount of hemolysis, because hemoglobin either bound to haptoglobins or free when haptoglobin binding sites are saturated is continuously removed from the circulating blood by the reticuloendothelial system and kidneys.D24 When the plasma free hemoglobin level exceeds about 40 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , hemoglobin casts may form in renal tubules. There is little likelihood of renal shutdown from this effect unless the plasma hemoglobin level exceeds 100 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> .

Han and colleagues found plasma free hemoglobin levels to be 8.3 ± 1.3 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> before CPB, 33 ± 3.6 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> 10 minutes after the start of CPB, and 91 ± 8.4 mg · dL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> after CPB.H11 The plasma free hemoglobin level may be still higher several hours after CPB. Classically, this has been explained as continuing destruction of erythrocytes damaged but not destroyed during CPB.

Red blood cell mass often declines still further during the first 3 or 4 postoperative days. Although in the past this has been attributed to the shortened half-life of damaged erythrocytes, the entire matter of hemolysis during and after CPB may be considerably more complex than this finding suggests. C5b-9, a product of complement activation, is deposited on the surface of erythrocytes during CPB. This may play a major role in hemolysis associated with CPB.S2

### Systemic Vascular Resistance and Arterial Blood Pressure

At the onset of normothermic or moderately hypothermic CPB, systemic vascular resistance usually decreases abruptly. It then gradually increases toward normal throughout the period of CPB and may become higher than normal.C29,M17 Considerable variation exists from patient to patient in systemic vascular resistance and thus in systemic arterial blood pressure during perfusion. In patients with coronary artery disease, a high systemic vascular resistance tends to develop during CPB.W4

Precise mechanisms underlying these variations in systemic vascular resistance during clinical CPB have not been identified, except in one situation. When, after a protracted period of global myocardial ischemia, cardiac reperfusion is commenced, systemic arterial pressure and resistance decrease within about 30 to 45 seconds.D11 This interval coincides with the time it takes the cardiac reperfusate to appear in the coronary sinus, return to the pump-oxygenator via the venous cannula, pass through that machine, and be returned to the patient. Contents of the coronary sinus blood first appearing after an appreciable period of global myocardial ischemia likely contain vasodilating substances that develop in the heart during the ischemic period. Some studies have suggested that this blood contains a large number of leukocytes that have been sequestered in the heart during global myocardial ischemia.B25,B53,S8

In general, it is not necessary to pharmacologically manipulate systemic vascular resistance during CPB, but some evidence indicates that cerebral blood flow is lower than desirable when mean arterial blood pressure during normothermic or moderately hypothermic CPB goes below about 40 mmHg. Therefore, when mean blood pressure is lower than 40 mmHg for more than a few minutes during rewarming, the rational approach is to increase systemic vascular resistance with pharmacologic agents that will elevate arterial blood pressure (see Chapter 4). Increasing Q above usual values during rewarming is generally ineffective in increasing arterial pressure. When systemic vascular resistance becomes so high during this phase of CPB that mean arterial blood pressure increases to more than 100 mmHg, it is prudent to reduce it pharmacologically to less than that level (see Chapter 4).

A vasoplegic syndrome (low systemic arterial pressure despite high cardiac output or CPB Q and adequate fluid infusion with low systemic vascular resistance) has been observed following onset of CPB.A21,G18,G19 Patients who have a significant decline in mean arterial pressure early after initiation of CPB are more likely to become vasoplegic postoperatively and are more likely to die in the hospital or have a prolonged length of stay.L10 Patients with the vasoplegic syndrome have inappropriate low serum arginine vasopressin concentrations.A21 Infusion of vasopressin increases blood pressure and reduces catecholamine requirements.A21,M12 Methylene blue has also been used to treat patients with catecholamine-resistant vasoplegia.L14

Other risk factors for developing the vasoplegic syndrome after CPB include preoperative angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or beta-blocker use, low ejection fraction, use of pressors or aprotinin before CPB, low pre-CPB mean arterial blood pressure, longer length of CPB, higher temperature on CPB, and higher pre- and post-CPB hematocrit.A21,L10

### Distribution of Blood Flow

Distribution of blood flow during CPB cannot be assumed to be similar to that when the circulation is intact. Distribution (and thus regional and organ blood flow) during CPB may vary according to age of the patient, amount of hemodilution, Q , arterial pulse contour, any pharmacologic manipulation, temperatures of the perfusate and patient, and arterial PCO2, pH, and PO2. The specific effect of some of these variables on distribution of blood flow is unclear. There may well be species differences, making data based on human subjects the most useful.R26

### *Cerebral Blood Flow*

Under conditions that often pertain in adults undergoing cardiac operations (nonpulsatile perfusion; flow 1.6 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ; temperature ± 25°C), cerebral blood flow (measured by radioactive xenon clearance) is about 25 mL · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · 100 g brain tissue<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , with some variability depending on PaCO2. G21 During CPB in monkeys, a similar value has been found (using microspheres), representing about 6% of total systemic blood flow.F18

In humans, cerebral blood flow during CPB is no less in elderly patients than in other adult patients, and it appears to be proportionally similar in neonates and infants to that in adults.B59,G26,G27 Thus, age appears to have little effect on the proportion of total flow represented by cerebral blood flow under usual circumstances of CPB.

During normothermic and moderately hypothermic CPB in adults and elderly patients, cerebral blood flow is not importantly altered with variations of *mean arterial blood pressure*. B59,G26 This is similar to the situation in normal awake adult humans, in whom cerebral blood flow does not vary significantly with variations of arterial blood pressure (mean) from about 60 to 150 mmHg. When arterial blood pressure during CPB falls below about 40 mmHg, cerebral blood flow may decline appreciably, with a concomitant decrease in cerebral oxygen consumption.F6,T7 A reasonable inference is that in adults on CPB, arterial blood pressure need not be manipulated pharmacologically unless it is less than 40 to 50 mmHg.

By contrast, during hypothermic CPB—at least in neonates, infants, and children—cerebral blood flow is dependent on arterial blood pressure.G25,G26,G27 Corresponding variations in cerebral oxygen consumption have not been established with certainty. In view of this, arterial blood pressure should probably be kept above about 25 mmHg in this setting in young patients.

The effect of *decreased CPB flow rate* (Q ) on cerebral blood flow in humans is incompletely understood, in part because of the interaction between perfusion Q and arterial blood pressure (see Chapter 4).F6 However, during moderately hypothermic CPB at the usual flow rates, there appears to be a direct correlation between CPB and cerebral blood flow rates, despite the poor or absent correlation between arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow.S23

Cerebral blood flow during CPB is affected by *arterial carbon dioxide pressure* (PaCO2). Hypercarbia increases cerebral blood flow, whereas hypocarbia decreases it.G21,M33,P18 In children undergoing hypothermic CPB, the flow increases 1.2 mL · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · 100 g brain tissue<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> for every 1-mmHg increase in PaCO2 (measured at 37°C) between 33 and 50 mmHg.K5 Infants have a slightly blunted response. Data gathered by Kern and colleagues are compatible with the hypothesis that under usual conditions of hypothermic CPB, metabolic needs of the brain are met with a PaCO2 value of 33 mmHg.K5

Although *autoregulation of cerebral blood flow* has been described during normothermic and moderately hypothermic CPB, it may well be that it is the remainder of the body, *not* the brain, that accomplishes autoregulation. This was suggested by the experimental studies of Fox and colleagues.F18

Cerebral blood flow during CPB may at times be excessive in relation to cerebral oxygen consumption. For example, Croughwell and colleagues found that during CPB and reduction of the patient's body temperature from 37°C to 28°C, cerebral blood flow decreased less than cerebral oxygen consumption. This was referred to as a situation of *luxuriant cerebral blood flow* accompanied by a narrowing of the cerebral arteriovenous oxygen difference.C37 Similar luxury perfusion can result from hypercarbia, and it has been argued that this increases the risk of cerebral damage by microemboli.H25,H27 This is an argument against use of pHstat strategy for control of PaCO2 during CPB.

#### *Cutaneous Blood Flow*

Clinical information strongly suggests that blood flow to the skin is severely reduced during nonpulsatile CPB in humans. The small bald spot that develops on the back of the head after CPB in some patients is probably the result of the pressure produced by weight of the head on an area of poorly perfused skin in contact with even a well-padded pillow during operation. Ease with which burns are produced by the cautery pad may also be the result of poor blood flow to the skin during CPB.

Of interest, a study of the sublingual microcirculation in humans has shown that the proportion of perfused small blood vessels decreases importantly and similarly with induction of anesthesia in patients undergoing thyroidectomy, and cardiac surgery with or without CPB.D6 In the CPB group, the proportion of perfused small vessels decreased after induction, improved slightly thereafter, failed to return to baseline, and persisted after 24 hours (Fig. 2-17). The off-pump cardiac surgery patients had less severe but statistically significant microcirculatory alterations immediately postoperatively. These alterations improved slightly but also persisted after 24 hours. Thus, microvascular perfusion was altered similarly in CPB and off-pump patients 6 to 24 hours after admission to the intensive care unit. In thyroidectomy patients, early changes reversed rapidly in the postoperative period. Severity of microvascular alterations correlated with peak lactate levels after cardiac surgery (*P* < .05).D6 These findings suggest that

(From DeBacker and colleagues.D6)

changes in the microcirculation cannot be attributed entirely to CPB.

### Venous Tone

Veins constrict during CPB, and venous tone is increased. This increase may persist for some hours afterward.G2,R10 The mechanism has not been determined with certainty, but high levels of circulating catecholamines probably play an important role.

### Catecholamine Response

Response of circulating epinephrine (released primarily from the adrenal medulla) and norepinephrine (which overflows into the bloodstream from generalized sympathetic nervous system discharge) has been studied by many groups, with somewhat conflicting results.H17,H33,P15,T6,T32 However, it is now clear that CPB is associated with a massive catecholamine release, greater than that from nearly any other form of stress. With onset of CPB in adult patients with coronary artery disease, plasma epinephrine levels increase; they begin to decline after discontinuation of bypassW4 (Fig. 2-18, *A*). Persisting elevation 1 hour after operation occurs only in patients with postoperative hypertension.

Plasma norepinephrine levels do not increase in adult patients who remain normotensive postoperatively, but in those with postoperative hypertension, it increases at the start of operation and reaches a peak at the start of CPB (Fig. 2-18, *B*). It remains elevated at 1 hour postoperatively in this group. These patients show arterial blood pressure responses typical for patients undergoing CPB, with a striking decrease at the onset of CPB from reduced systemic arteriolar resistance (Fig. 2-18, *C*).

Mean arterial blood pressure 1 hour after operation correlates positively with both plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine levels. Neonates, infants, and young children also demonstrate marked increase in catecholamine concentration during CPB.A15,A16,R12,W4

Sympathetic–adrenal system discharge during, and in some patients after, operation is presumably related to use of CPB. The increased catecholamine response, particularly of norepinephrine, is partly attributable to the fact that during CPB, blood does not pass through the lungs, where norepinephrine is largely inactivated.R12

### Adrenal Cortical Hormones

Clinical studies nearly uniformly demonstrate large increases in cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormones with initiation of CPB.A16,T13,T15 After CPB, patients exhibit markedly elevated levels of cortisol (free and total) for more than 24 hours.U3 It is not clearly established whether the elevated corticosteroid concentrations during CPB are deleterious or beneficial.

#### Vasopressin

Vasopressin, or antidiuretic hormone (ADH), is secreted by the pituitary gland and is a potent regulator of renal water excretion. Cardiac operations employing CPB are associated with large increases in ADH concentration that exceed those during other major surgical procedures; they can persist early postoperatively.K3,V14,W29

### Body Composition

After CPB, extracellular fluid volume is increased.B49,C22 The increase is in the interstitial fluid compartment, as shown by increased interstitial fluid pressure during CPB.C22,R20 Plasma volume tends to be decreased.C22 The magnitude of increase in extracellular fluid volume is directly related to duration of CPB (Fig. 2-19) and is greater when hemodilution is used.C26 It is also greater with hypothermia and higher CPB Q . F2,H21 The large thoracic duct lymph flow occurring during CPB is related to this tendency of the interstitial fluid volume to increase.B9 Also, exchangeable sodium is increased after CPB, while total exchangeable potassium is decreased.P1 Amount and concentration of intracellular potassium are decreased.P1

These acute changes are probably, at least in part, the result of some of the damaging effects of CPB, including increases in capillary permeability, which probably facilitate the changes in body composition.B35,C36,D4,M8,T10,T11 Neurohumoral alterations resulting from a period of relatively nonpulsatile flow may also be contributing factors.

#### Thermal Balance

Heat is lost during CPB. A study of 6 adult patients cooled to 30°C during bypass lasting 130 minutes showed a mean net loss of 1000 kJ of heat (1 kilocalorie = 4.2 kJ) by the end of hypothermia.D5 Loss to the heat exchanger and pump circuit was 840 kJ, and evaporative and convective loss was 380 kJ; the patient's metabolism supplied 220 kJ. During rewarming to a nasopharyngeal temperature of 37°C, the pump-oxygenator returned 670 kJ to the patient. Loss of heat during the period of anesthesia preceding bypass was not accounted for. Patients therefore left the operating room with a deficit of at least 330 kJ, equivalent to more than 1.5 hours of basal energy production. This deficit has to be restored early postoperatively, and the extra metabolism necessary to

do this places a strain on the circulation that at times may be substantial. When deeper hypothermia is used, the problem is magnified, because muscle rewarms slowly and heat loss during operation is greater. It is necessary to bear in mind that the temperature of the muscles and body fat remains considerably lower than that of the nasopharynx after a short period of rewarming.

After CPB, a hypermetabolic state exists for at least 6 hours, sometimes longer. V O2 and carbon dioxide production are increased during this period, and body temperature may rise precipitously.C12,T30 The possible relationship between intracellular levels of IL-1 and hyperpyrexia is discussed earlier in this section under "Cytokines."

### AGENTS OF DAMAGE

### Foreign Surfaces

Recognition by the cells that the surfaces in the pumpoxygenator system are foreign is a fundamental inciting agent for the damaging effects of CPB, as previously described.E2,E3 All elements of blood, formed and soluble, are affected. These phenomena were perhaps first reported by Lee and colleagues in 1972 and termed *protein denaturation*. L7 In subsequent years, further effects of CPB on the complement cascade, white cell, and platelet elements and humoral and endothelial systems have been elucidated. Selectins, kallikreins, kinins, leukotrienes, TNF, proteases, cytokines, and others are activated, liberated, or suppressed during CPB, presumably by exposure to foreign or nonbiological surfaces or the blood/gas interface.

Because it is only in the boundary layer of flowing blood that the foreign surface is encountered, opportunity for damage is directly related to the proportion of the blood flowing there. Thus, it is in the oxygenator, where this proportion is deliberately made as large as possible to promote efficient gas exchange, that the opportunity for surface interactions and damage is greatest. This includes bubble oxygenators, because gases themselves are recognized as foreign surfaces when in direct contact with blood. It is next greatest in the heat exchanger, next in filters, and least in tubing and reservoirs.

Some artificial surfaces are more interactive with blood than others; nylon may be a particular offender.C10 Surfaces may be passified to some extent in the initial few minutes of CPB by deposition on them of denatured albumin, platelets, and other substances, but in oxygenators this is disadvantageous to gas exchange.G20 Experimentally, some of the surfaces of certain parts of pump-oxygenator systems have been seeded with endothelial cells, but this has not yet been made practicable.

Currently, most pump-oxygenator systems have coated circuits to reduce the formed blood elements' response to the artificial surface of the perfusion circuit. These range from synthetic coatings, to covalent heparin bonded coatings, to albumin-based coatings. All have been associated with a decrease in the amount of formed blood elements deposited on the surfaces of the perfusion circuit.

### Shear Stresses

Shear stresses are generated by blood pumps, suction systems, abrupt acceleration and deceleration of blood, and cavitation around the end of the arterial cannula. For the leukocyte, they are an important abnormal event during CPB. This is in part because leukocytes are the largest formed blood element and are normally exposed to nonendothelialized surfaces, and because they are capable of exiting from the vascular space by diapedesis and by migrating via chemotactic gradients. They are also capable of phagocytosis and, because of their proteolytic and enzymatic components, of digesting almost any biological material. Martin demonstrated that shear stresses not only increase leukocyte disruption but also increase degranulation and adherence and decrease aggregation, chemotactic migration, and phagocytosis in nondisrupted leukocytes.M10

Erythrocytes are damaged during CPB primarily by shear stresses. The amount of hemolysis and liberated free hemoglobin increases linearly as shear increases.S22 In CPB systems, hemolysis is much less without the oxygenator in the system, and bubble oxygenators have been shown to produce more hemolysis than membrane oxygenators.A11,C19,M35 Interaction of the damaging effects is again demonstrated by the fact that the critical shear stress for erythrocytes is lowered by presence of an unphysiologic surface. Intracardiac sucker systems are particularly damaging to erythrocytes, not only because of high shear stresses and deceleration injury but also because negative pressures are more damaging to erythrocytes than positive ones.

#### Incorporation of Foreign Substances

In intact humans, foreign substances rarely enter the arterial bloodstream, although when they do, the well-recognized pathologic state of arterial thromboembolism may develop. During CPB, air bubbles, particulate matter from the pumpoxygenator, platelet aggregates and fragments, fibrin aggregates, denatured protein particles, atheroma, and chylomicrons may be contained in the arterial blood and may be distributed throughout the patient's arterial system.B39,B50,C20,D15,R6

Microembolization is greatest during the first 5 to 10 minutes of CPB.C20 Perhaps related to this, the total amount of microembolization is not correlated with duration of CPB.B39 The amount does seem to be decreased by a smallpore filter in the arterial tubing of the pump-oxygenator, but this is arguable.B39 Microembolization is greater when bubble oxygenators rather than membrane oxygenators are used.B38,B40 Embolized particles, whatever they may be, usually cause only transient obstructions to flow; thus, after 5 to 10 days, there is usually little evidence of their presence.B37 Nevertheless, there is some correlation between depressed neuropsychometric test scores postoperatively and number of microemboli.B39,F5

There are many potential sources of microemboli. In some instances, pump-oxygenator surfaces have fine deposits of debrisR6; this has led some to advocate preliminary filtration of blood that has passed through the system before CPB is established. Gas bubbles are commonly found in the arterial input to the patient; these must have multiple sources, although they have been shown to be more prevalent when bubble oxygenators are used. There is some suggestion from the work of Clark and colleagues and Donald and Fellows that large temperature gradients between the water bath and blood in the heat exchanger (i.e., rapid cooling and rewarming) are accompanied by a showering of gaseous microemboli.C20,D15 Adhesion and aggregation of platelets during CPB (see "Platelet Response," earlier) and formation of fibrin despite heparinization (see "Humoral Response," earlier) contribute importantly to microembolization.B39 Intracardiac sucker systems incorporate gaseous macro- and microemboli, fibrin, platelet aggregates, and debris into the blood, some of which cannot be removed before the blood is returned to the patient.

Gradual improvements in techniques and equipment for CPB have decreased the prevalence of foreign substances and cellular debris entering the patient's arterial system during cardiac surgery.A22,B39 This problem remains important and the subject of continuing research, because it probably contributes to neuropsychiatric abnormalities after CPB and to cardiac, pulmonary, and other subsystem dysfunction.B39

#### Heparin

Heparin is administered before and during CPB to prevent coagulation of blood (see "Heparin Levels" under Controlled Variables earlier in this section, and see "Heparinization and Later Protamine Administration" under Preparation for Cardiopulmonary Bypass in Section III). It is an agent of damage, in part because it is an imperfect anticoagulant that permits formation of microthrombi in the pumpoxygenator that can embolize to the patient. In rare instances, heparin produces an adverse effect such as severe thrombocytopenia.

Efforts continue to be made to avoid heparinizing patients in the usual manner, primarily by making surfaces of the pump-oxygenator biocompatible. The most common method involves bonding heparin to these surfaces.V12

Contraindications to use of unfractionated heparin include HIT, heparin allergy, or protamine allergy. Currently, alternative agents are undergoing laboratory and clinical investigation. These include low-molecular-weight heparin and heparinoids, ancrod (a defibrinogenating agent derived from pit viper venom), hirudin (a coagulation inhibitor derived from the salivary glands of the medicinal leech), and coagulation factor inhibitors such as factor IXia, an inhibitor of factor IXa, and argatroban, an inhibitor of factor IIa.F22

#### Protamine

Protamine is generally necessary after terminating CPB to reverse the effect of heparin. However, it is an agent with damaging effects because it activates the complement cascade through the classic pathway, and occasionally provokes temporary (5-15 minutes) severe bronchospasm, elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance, and hypotension.K6,L20 Whether prevalence of these undesirable reactions is reduced by slow administration of the drug or by infusing it into the left atrium or aorta rather than the right atrium is arguable.

### PREVENTION OF UNDESIRABLE RESPONSES

True prevention of the fundamentally disadvantageous and undesirable responses to CPB has eluded the cardiovascular surgical community despite intensive efforts. Developments in molecular biology may provide techniques that some day accomplish this. To date, only palliative measures are available, some of which are described in "Other Additives" under Controlled Variables.

### SAFE DURATION OF TOTAL CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS

*Partial CPB* is better tolerated than total CPB,I1 and its safe duration is measured in days if a true membrane oxygenator is used (see "Cardiopulmonary Support and Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation" in Section I of Chapter 5). Safe duration of *total CPB* is much shorter and is measured in hours, although not fully defined. The safety of CPB is known to be adversely affected by certain incremental risk factors.

Duration of CPB is clearly a risk factor for morbidity (Fig. 2-20) and mortality after cardiac surgery, but the

![](_page_35_Figure_10.jpeg)

**Figure 2-20** Nomogram from a multivariable analysis (see Table 2-4) of probability of morbidity (cardiac, pulmonary, renal, and coagulation dysfunction) after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) according to its duration. Relationships are shown for four age groups at a C3a level of 882 ng · mL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> (median value in the study). Dashed lines enclose 70% confidence intervals. (From Kirklin and colleagues.K7)

relationship between duration of total CPB and morbidity and mortality is affected by other risk factors as well. Type of oxygenator is probably one such risk factor; in general, true membrane oxygenators are the safest, followed by microporous oxygenators. Bubble oxygenators are generally the least safe. In contrast to moderate or deep hypothermia, normothermia throughout most of the period of total CPB is arguably a risk factor that affects the relationship between duration of CPB and unfavorable outcomes (see General Comments and Strategy in Section III). Absence of hemodilution is probably a risk factor. Very low venous oxygen levels, although no doubt interrelated with some of the previously mentioned risk factors, appear to increase the risk of unfavorable events after CPB.

It is arguable that patient age is a risk factor for unfavorable outcome events after CPB, but the impression is that very young (Fig. 2-21) and very old age have an unfavorable effect on the relation between duration of CPB and prevalence of unfavorable outcomes. Immature patients may have a greater tendency to develop increased capillary permeability than older patients, although this has not been well documented. Strength of the patient's humoral and cellular responses to CPB also affects this relationship, with greater complement activation appearing to have an unfavorable effect (see Table 2-4).

Thus, the relationship between safety and duration of total CPB depends on a number of factors that have mitigated against a complete understanding of it. Duration of CPB has clearly been identified as a risk factor for poor outcome in a wide range of studies of open heart surgical procedures. Nevertheless, it remains a possibility, even a likely one, that longer duration of CPB is primarily a marker for an operation that has not proceeded as planned. For example, in fairly well standardized operations such as CABG or the arterial switch procedure for transposition, duration of bypass beyond the expected range likely is a marker for technical problems with the procedure. It is factors related to poor technical operation, and not CPB duration, that have a causal relationship with increased morbidity. Other indirect evidence suggests that safe duration of CPB may be many hours, rather than a

![](_page_35_Figure_15.jpeg)

few. Patients can be supported on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for days and even weeks without developing circulation-related complications. It must be fully acknowledged, however, that closed ECMO circuits and open CPB circuits have many differences.

# **Section III Clinical Methodology of Cardiopulmonary Bypass**

### GENERAL COMMENTS AND STRATEGY

CPB should be used as a flexible clinical tool, recognizing its physiologic limitations, risks, and damaging effects. CPB is combined with at least some degree of hypothermia in many situations for the reasons given in Section II. An important advantage of hypothermia is that it allows safe periods of very low perfusion flow rate (≈0.5 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ) or circulatory arrest when needed, but the possible advantages of normothermic CPB continue to be explored. These include lower systemic vascular resistance and higher cardiac output in the early postoperative period and less blood loss.T22 However, decreased oxygen saturation (<50%) in the cerebral venous blood has also been observed, particularly during the early period of CPB.C28

Size of the arterial and venous cannulae is determined primarily by perfusion flow rate and type of venous return, but total perfusion flow rate—even at normothermia—is not an absolute quantity but encompasses a range of acceptable values. Thus, if the surgical situation compels use of smaller cannulae, perfusion flow rate can be set at a smaller value, or assisted venous return (vacuum, centrifugal pump) can be used.B3,F25,O4,T23 Two venous cannulae may be used as a routine or only for congenital heart disease operations, including those in infants, and operations involving the right atrium, such as tricuspid valve surgery. A single two-stage venous cannula, having additional holes that come to lie in the right atrium while the tip is in the inferior vena cava (IVC), may be used for CABG; operations on the aortic valve, mitral valve, and ascending aorta; some operations for congenital heart disease; and combinations of these procedures. Such a cannula has been shown experimentally to efficiently decompress the right heart.B18 On occasion, a single venous cannula may also be used with conventional CPB and without aortic clamping for simple operations such as replacement of a valved extracardiac conduit.

Method of cannulation, use of left atrial and left ventricular vents, monitoring catheters, and indeed all aspects of clinical CPB should be flexible within certain limits. The combined knowledge and experience of the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and perfusionist should allow adaptation to the surgical situation while ensuring the greatest possible safety for the patient.

Some operations traditionally performed with CPB support can be designed to avoid use of CPB. These include off-pump CABG (Chapter 7), bidirectional superior cavopulmonary shunt (Chapter 41, Section III), and extracardiac conduit Fontan operation (Chapter 41, Section IV). Percutaneous aortic valve replacement (Chapter 12), investigative percutaneous techniques to address mitral valve regurgitation, and intravascular aortic stent-grafting (Chapter 26) are examples of traditionally surgical procedures that are becoming catheter based or hybrid procedures that do not require CPB.

### POSITIONING MONITORING DEVICES

Monitoring devices used for various cardiac operations in infants, children, and adults and specific positioning are discussed in Chapter 4.

### POSITIONING PATIENT

The surgeon should collaborate with the anesthesiologist to position the patient correctly for operation, because an improperly positioned patient can make the operation more difficult and injure the patient. For a median sternotomy, both arms may be placed at the side to permit optimal access for the surgical team and avoid traction on the brachial plexus during operation. Alternatively, a carefully positioned arm board can be used for the left arm (and for venous and arterial catheters).

Particularly in infants, a pad is placed under the back to project the chest forward and extend the neck. The patient's trunk must not be rotated, and the arms at the side must be secured and protected to prevent compression of the ulnar nerve at the elbow. A cautery pad is placed under the buttocks or the back. Pads for external defibrillation may also be placed on the anterolateral left chest and the back. A draping framework is placed over the head of the patient and extended to either side to screen the patient's head and the anesthesiologist from the sterile field. A urethral catheter containing a thermistor is inserted into the bladder. A thermistor probe is positioned in the nasopharynx.

### PREPARING SURGICAL FIELD

The skin of the anterior thorax and abdomen is prepared with an antiseptic solution after mechanically cleansing it. In most patients, both groins should be prepared as well and draped into the surgical field so that the femoral vessels can be cannulated if necessary. Both legs are surgically prepared in their entirety for individuals undergoing CABG.

Appropriate sterile drapes are applied. Draping must shield the surgical field from the anesthesiologist, while at the same time allowing him or her an unobstructed view into the field.

Finally, the surgical field is covered by an impervious adhesive plastic sheet, in part to prevent the side drapes from falling away from the skin. It also prevents the drapes in the vicinity of the wound from becoming wet and thus losing their sterility.

Pump tubing is passed from the operating table to the perfusionist, who completes the CPB circuit. Tubing for infusion of cardioplegia, pericardial irrigation, suction, and venting is also positioned.

### INCISION

#### Primary Median Sternotomy

A straight vertical midline skin incision is generally made in patients undergoing CPB through a median sternotomy. This incision commences several centimeters below the suprasternal notch and extends to the tip of the xiphoid.

An exception may be made in prepubertal girls in whom a bilateral submammary skin incision is made that follows the fourth intercostal space. A flap of skin and subcutaneous tissue is raised superiorly and inferiorly to expose the full length of the sternum for a vertical sternotomy. However, this incision may cause underdevelopment of the breasts in girls of this age and should be used judiciously. When used in female patients of all ages, this incision may cause hypesthesia or anesthesia of the anterior chest wall.

The exact midline over the sternum is scored with the cautery. A retractor elevates the upper angle of the vertical skin incision, placing the underlying tissues on tension. The soft tissue is separated from the superior surface of the manubrium, and a right-angled clamp is passed over the denuded manubrium into the space behind, hugging the bone. The clamp is spread to create a space for the tip of the sternal saw. The suprasternal ligament is cut with the cautery.

The blade of an electric or air-driven saw is held snugly against the posterior surface of the manubrium with the cutting edge against the superior manubrial surface. After activating the saw, the surgeon cuts the manubrium and sternum, staying precisely in the midline. The tip of the saw is kept elevated so that the toe of the saw hugs the back of the sternum. During sawing, the anesthesiologist should cease ventilating the patient and exert no pressure on the lungs, so that the soft tissue and pleura will fall away from the sternum. Drifting away from the midline with the saw must be avoided because the sternum will not spread evenly, and its later closure will be more difficult.

Alternatively, the sternum can be divided from the bottom up. The xiphoid process is mobilized or excised, and the tip of the blade is introduced beneath it. In neonates and infants, the xiphoid process may be excised, the costal margin on either side elevated by sharp retractors, and sharp, wellaligned scissors used to cut the sternum in the midline, from below upward.

When the incision is properly made, the pleural spaces are infrequently entered. A thin layer of bone wax is spread over the bone marrow, primarily where the bleeding is active. When the sternum is fragile, as in older patients, it is better to avoid wax altogether. Bleeding points in the cut edge of the anterior and posterior sternal periosteum are cauterized, but excessive cauterization should be avoided. A retractor is inserted and opened just enough to permit dissection. After a few minutes, it is opened further. It should be opened no more than is necessary for the procedure, because excessive retraction, particularly of the upper half of the sternum, may cause rib fractures, dislocation of costochondral junctions, injury to the brachial plexus, and damage to the stellate ganglion.

Dissection continues by incising the fascia that envelops the thymus gland. The right and left lobes of the thymus are separated up to the level of the brachiocephalic vein. In infants and children, and occasionally in adults, the thymus may be subtotally resected, leaving only the cervical portion cephalad to the brachiocephalic vein, to avoid expanding hematomas that may cause postoperative bleeding.

The pericardium is then opened longitudinally in the midline, from the diaphragm below to the brachiocephalic vein above. Where this incision meets the diaphragm, care must be taken not to incise the parietal peritoneum. If entry is made into the peritoneal cavity, the opening is sutured to avoid sequestration of blood and fluid in it. The pericardium is cut at right angles to the longitudinal incision at its diaphragmatic end, farther on the left than on the right, after pushing back the pleura to avoid entering the pleural spaces. Pericardial stay sutures are then placed.

### Alternative Primary Incisions

Incisions other than a full median sternotomy are being used with increasing frequency. These incisions and the techniques of cannulation required for their use are described at the end of this section in Special Situations and Controversies.

The remainder of the general discussion on the clinical methods of CPB focuses on the median sternotomy approach to the pericardial cavity and its contents.

### Secondary Median Sternotomy

The surgeon must estimate preoperatively the chances that catastrophic hemorrhage will develop from repeat sternotomy. This affects the decision regarding whether to cannulate peripheral vessels and establish CPB before sternotomy. It is helpful to study the chest radiograph and any available cineangiograms. However, cross-sectional imaging by CT or MRI provides the most useful information. When one of the great arteries, right ventricle, coronary artery bypass grafts, or a right ventricle to pulmonary trunk conduit is in close proximity to the back of the sternum, peripheral cannulation, establishment of CPB, and induction of moderate hypothermia before sternotomy are prudent precautions.

When a previous sternotomy has been performed, an oscillating saw is commonly used. Properly used with a light touch by the operator, this saw allows the sternum to be split without damage to underlying structures. Once the sternum is divided, a sharp handheld retractor is inserted to elevate the lower left sternal fragment. Dissection is commenced just beneath the xiphisternum, dividing the tissues *just* behind the sternum. Working from below upward, the surgeon frees the left sternal edge in this manner to the level of the suprasternal notch. The same maneuver is repeated on the right side. Returning to the left sternal edge, the surgeon fully elevates it with two retractors and carries the dissection leftward, keeping fairly close to the sternum until the divided edge of the pericardium is identified (when the pericardium has not been sutured at the first operation, it retracts well away from the midline). The left edge of the pericardium is separated from the underlying ventricle with scissors. This plane is usually easily developed inferiorly above the diaphragm. This limited left-sided dissection is carried superiorly also over the pulmonary trunk, avoiding damage to the tip of the left atrial appendage and left phrenic nerve. If the left internal thoracic artery was used as a bypass graft during the previous operation, it must be identified and protected.

The rib spreader is then inserted and opened. Right-sided structures usually must also be completely dissected. The plane of dissection for this is also most easily developed inferiorly above the diaphragm. It is often best accomplished partly from below and partly from above at the anterior and right lateral margins of the aorta. The inferior and superior dissections can frequently be easily connected by careful blunt dissection with the finger posteriorly, just in front of the right pulmonary veins and left atrium. Finally, the lateral right atrium is carefully freed, leaving a piece of pericardium attached to the atrium if it is too densely adherent. This is often at the site of previously placed pursestring sutures.

It is very important during dissection of the aorta to remain outside the adventitial layer. The outer edge of the superior vena cava (SVC) is then dissected. To permit later clamping, the aorta requires further dissection, particularly posteriorly in front of the right pulmonary artery and on the left lateral margin.

Further dissection should be avoided unless it is necessary for proper exposure. Operations in which more extensive dissection may be necessary include redo CABG and repairs inside the right ventricle (see later chapters). When further mobilization is necessary, it is usually deferred until CPB has been established. The heart can then be emptied and dissection performed more precisely and more easily, with no hemodynamic disturbances. However, perfusion at this stage should be normothermic to prevent ventricular fibrillation and overdistention of the heart. If the heart cannot be completely mobilized, the left pleural space may be entered and opened widely, because this allows cardiac defibrillation and the usual de-airing maneuvers at the end of the operation.

### PREPARATION FOR CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS

Once the pericardial stay sutures are inserted, size and any abnormalities of the cardiac chambers are noted, anomalies of systemic venous return (especially a persistent left SVC) or pulmonary venous return are sought. A left atrial monitoring catheter, if indicated, may be inserted at this time or later, just before discontinuing CPB. For this, a 3-0 purse-string stitch is placed on the right superior pulmonary vein just posterior to the right atrium (Fig. 2-22). A fine polyvinyl catheter is threaded into a 16-gauge Tuohy needle, the needle is inserted into the left atrium through the purse string, the catheter is advanced about 2 cm, the needle is withdrawn, and the purse string is tied. A 5-0 stitch is placed in the adjacent pericardium and tied snugly around the catheter, very near the purse string. The other end of the catheter is brought through the skin and attached to a pressure gauge.

### Siting and Purse-String Sutures for Aortic Cannulation

The site for cannulation of the aorta should be within the pericardial reflection whenever possible, because the aorta where the pericardium is fused onto the anterior surface is

![](_page_38_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Figure 2-22** Schematic representation showing positions of sites for cannulae and catheters. As indicated in the text, not all are used in every patient. Key: *IVC,* Inferior vena cava; *LA,* left atrium; *RA,* right atrium; *SVC,* superior vena cava.

tougher and better for cannulation than the part outside (beyond and downstream to) the reflection. In this location, the cannulation site is proximal (upstream) to the origin of the brachiocephalic artery. The site should be a little to the left side of the anterior aortic surface (to the right side in patients with right aortic arch) as an added precaution against the cannula tip entering the brachiocephalic artery. At times in infants, in children with a previously constructed Waterston anastomosis or with truncus arteriosus, in adults with short ascending aortas or ascending aortic aneurysms, and in those about to undergo primary or redo CABG, the pericardial reflection over the cephalad end of the ascending aorta can be dissected off the aorta, the aorta retracted inferiorly, and the purse-string sutures placed on the anterior aortic wall at the level of, or if necessary distal (downstream) to, the orifice of the brachiocephalic artery on the aortic arch. In such situations, care is taken to position the aortic clamp proximal (upstream) to the orifice of the brachiocephalic artery.

Two purse-string sutures of 2-0 or 3-0 polyester or polypropylene are placed. They should catch only the adventitia and must not penetrate into the lumen. Tourniquets are placed on these sutures. When the aorta is scarred from a previous operation, a single pledgeted 3-0 polypropylene box stitch may be used at the cannulation site. A purse-string stitch is also placed for the cardioplegic needle or venting cannula (see Fig. 2-22).

The aorta of older patients, particularly those with coronary artery disease, may be arteriosclerotic, and its manipulation, cannulation, and clamping may result in dislodging and embolizing atheroma. It is prudent to perform epiaortic ultrasonographic scanning of the aorta in such patients to detect severe arteriosclerosis and position cannulae and clamps in areas where arteriosclerotic disease is minimal or absent (see Chapter 26). Alternatively, off-pump coronary revascularization may be used or on-CPB beating heart revascularization with peripheral cannulation and without aortic clamping (see "Cardiopulmonary Bypass Established by Peripheral Cannulation" under Special Situations and Controversies later in this section).T9

### Siting and Purse-String Sutures for Venous Cannulation

Purse-string sutures for venous cannulation can be placed before or after heparinization and aortic cannulation. Number and sites of these purse strings depend on the perfusion technique to be used. When a single venous cannula is used, only a right atrial appendage purse-string suture is needed.

When two venous cannulae are used, the SVC and IVC may be cannulated directly. This approach is an old one, but has been refined by availability of smaller cannulae. With this method, venous drainage and exposure within the atria and ventricles are excellent, even in infants. An oval-shaped purse string is placed on the presenting surface of the SVC (see Fig. 2-22), and a tape is placed around the SVC. For this, an incision is made in the pericardial reflection over the right pulmonary artery on the medial side of the SVC and again lateral to the SVC. These incisions allow a right-angled clamp to be passed easily around the SVC to grasp the tape and pull it through. The tape is placed in a rubber or plastic tourniquet. Alternatively, the SVC may be cannulated through a purse string in the right atrial appendage. To pass a tape around the IVC, the pericardial reflection posterior to the IVC and just inferior to the right inferior pulmonary vein is incised. This maneuver clearly delineates the inferior border of the right inferior pulmonary vein and left atrium. It establishes a free communication between the two pericardial spaces, which permits better circulation of the external cooling fluid, and provides a space for the IVC tape to be placed. Alternatively, the IVC can be mobilized by first passing the fingers to the right of and behind the cava and breaking down the pericardial reflection posteriorly by blunt dissection. The hand is then removed and a right-angled clamp substituted. The tip of this instrument is exposed by retracting the lateral right atrial wall superiorly and to the left. Usually, the clamp slides around the IVC without further dissection. Occasionally, tissue must be divided with scissors, working lateral to the right atrium and below the inferior pulmonary vein. Then the surgeon, with tissue forceps or a sponge, retracts the right atrium superiorly and to the left to expose the presenting surface of the IVC, which may require limited dissection from the diaphragm. A purse-string stitch is placed at the junction of the right atrium and IVC, or on the IVC itself, in a transverse oval shape (see Fig. 2-22).

### Heparinization and Later Protamine Administration

Measurement of activated clotting time (ACT) and calculation of a heparin dose-response curve allows heparin and protamine doses to be individualized for each patient.B1 First a baseline, or control, ACT is established after sternotomy. Heparin (300-400 units · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> or 3-4 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) is then given. After 3 to 5 minutes, the ACT is again determined. Additional heparin is given as needed to achieve an ACT of greater than 400 seconds. Cannulation is then performed. Heparin (3 units · mL<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) is added to the priming volume of the pumpoxygenator (e.g., 5000 units for a 1600-mL clear solution). After CPB is established, the ACT is determined every 30 minutes, and additional heparin is given to maintain the ACT at greater than 400 seconds during normothermic CPB and at greater than 480 seconds during hypothermic CPB (<30°C). The ACT should be measured more frequently if it does not respond appropriately to additional doses of heparin. (See cautions about the interference of aprotinin and other factors with interpretation of ACT, particularly when measured with Celite, in "Other Additives" in Section II.)

Protamine sulfate is given at the end of CPB, after removal of all cannulae. This biological product, obtained from the sperm of fish, is a simple protein of low molecular weight. It is a heparin antagonist, forming with heparin a heparinprotamine complex. Protamine has a rapid onset of action, but the heparin-protamine complex may be partially metabolized or react with fibrinolysin, thus freeing heparin and causing a *heparin rebound*.

Several methods are available to calculate the dosage of protamine to be administered at the end of CPB.M31 These methods and their advantages and disadvantages are listed in Table 2-5. A widely used method involves administering 1 to 1.5 mg of protamine for each 100 units (or each mg) of heparin; 1 mg of protamine neutralizes approximately 85 units of heparin. Extra protamine is given to prevent heparin rebound associated with heparin release from tissue stores or from heparin-protamine aggregates, and to compensate for the probable shorter biological half-life of protamine.M31

**Method Advantages Disadvantages** Fixed dose Simple Inadequate or excessive protamine (1-1.5 mg heparin · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) Not reliant on ACT Potential for increased coagulation times with standard doses ACT/heparin doseresponse curves Rapid, easy to use in OR No correlation between ACT and heparin levels More accurate protamine administration Relies on ACT Decreased blood product requirements Dependence on plasma volume Heparin levels Less protamine given Requires peripheral laboratory Not reliant on ACT Time consuming Assumes point on static curve Protamine titration Less protamine required than fixed dose Variability between heparin and protamine preparations Decreased postoperative bleeding Dependence on blood volume estimate No rebound effect seen with small protamine doses Several steps for potential error Assumes point on static curve

### Arterial Cannulation

After heparin has been administered, the adventitia within the purse string is incised. With the aorta stabilized by a gauze sponge under the surgeon's left index finger, a digitally controlled stab wound of sufficient length is made within the purse string. The aortic cannula can then be slipped into the aorta easily and usually bloodlessly. Care is taken to adjust the cannula so that only 5 to 10 mm projects into the aorta. If an angled cannula is used, it is positioned so that the opening faces distally into the aortic arch.

The tourniquet on the purse-string suture is secured, and the cannula is tied to it. The arterial cannula is connected to the arterial tubing from the pump-oxygenator and carefully de-aired. All clamps are then removed from this tubing if a roller pump is used, but *not* if the arterial pump is of the controlled vortex type. This technique may be used in adults, children, infants, and neonates.

Alternatively in neonates, infants, and small children, a fine side-biting clamp (Cooley or Castaneda) is used. All layers of the aorta, including the adventitia, are thicker in these small patients, and an excluding clamp will not damage the intima. The excluded portion of aorta is opened longitudinally with a knife. The purse-string stitch is then positioned, and the cannula tip is inserted into the opening while releasing the clamp. With this technique, the arterial cannula can have a long tip beyond the collar and is positioned so that this tip lies in the transverse portion of the aortic arch, safely beyond the origin of the brachiocephalic artery. Alternatively, the arterial cannula may have a very short tip beyond its collar, and the cannula will be perpendicular to the aorta after its insertion.

### Venous Cannulation

When a single venous cannula is to be used, a suitable clamp is placed across the right atrial appendage, the appendage is opened, hemostats or forceps are placed on both edges, and the cannula is inserted into the right atrium. A single two-stage venous cannula of variable diameter may be used in adults undergoing CABG, aortic valve replacement, or in some cases of mitral valve replacement. When properly positioned, the tip will be in the IVC and the side holes in the mid-right atrium.

When two venous cannulae and caval taping are to be used, a clamp is placed across the right atrial appendage, the appendage is opened, and one and then the other venous cannula is inserted through this opening. One is guided into the SVC and the other into the IVC. Alternatively, direct caval cannulation can be used. The right atrium adjacent to the IVC is retracted by the surgeon with tissue forceps or a sponge, a stab wound is made in the center of the IVC purse string, and the cannula is inserted. A stab wound is made in the center of the purse string on the SVC, and this venous cannula is inserted. CPB is then established (see Commencing Cardiopulmonary Bypass and Left Heart Venting later in this section). Direct caval cannulation can be difficult in neonates and infants when the heart is large. In these small patients, maneuvers required for exposure of the IVC can lead to severe hypotension.

After the cannulae are inserted, each tip must lie directly parallel to the walls of the vena cava, with the tip of the SVC cannula pointing upward and that of the IVC downward. Otherwise, venous obstruction will result. Precision in positioning the tips of the cannulae can be obtained by attaching the cannulae to the Y connector on the venous line in exactly the right orientation before their insertion. When exposure of the IVC is particularly difficult, the SVC may be cannulated first, partial CPB established, and the IVC then exposed for placing the tape and purse-string suture and for inserting the cannula.

Two venous cannulae inserted directly into the cavae as described are well suited for operations in children, infants, and neonates down to a body weight of about 2.5 kg. When the cannulae are placed as described, venous drainage is excellent; this can be verified by routine measurement of SVC pressure through an indwelling small catheter previously introduced into the internal jugular vein. An advantage of direct caval cannulation in cases in which the major portion of the operation is performed during hypothermic circulatory arrest is that the heart may be opened and the exposure arranged during the latter part of cooling and before the arrest period. The cardiac chambers can be closed during rewarming. A disadvantage is that when the heart is closed, the inferior caval cannula may have to be repositioned into the right atrium to prevent its distention by blood returning from the coronary sinus, SVC, or both.

### COMMENCING CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS AND LEFT HEART VENTING

On command from the surgeon, the perfusionist commences CPB. The surgeon removes the arterial and venous line clamps (if present). The perfusion flow is gradually increased to about 2.2 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , and after the proper flow has been obtained, perfusion cooling (if indicated) is begun.

In neonates and infants, the priming volume of the pump may be maintained at a temperature of 18°C to 22°C, 30°C, or 37°C. If a cold prime is used, myocardial function is immediately affected after establishing CPB. Heart rate slows and contraction is impaired. The contribution to total blood flow by the heart rapidly diminishes. Therefore, the arterial pump must rapidly reach full flow to maintain adequate systemic perfusion. The heart should be carefully observed during this period for ventricular distention, especially in infants and neonates with high ventricular compliance and a heart less tolerant of excessive preload. If distention occurs, pump flow must be reduced and the venous cannulae repositioned. If cardiac contractility is maintained during initiation of CPB, it is preferable to maintain ventilation until full flow is achieved.

For operations in adults and older children, the left-heart venting catheter is inserted from the right side directly into the left atrium through a purse-string stitch positioned at the junction of the right superior pulmonary vein and the left atrium (see Fig. 2-22). The stitch should pick up atrial wall and the adventitia of the pulmonary vein, and should not be large enough to compromise the pulmonary vein orifice when tied down. In most cases a long, soft, angled catheter is used, and it is advanced through the mitral valve into the left ventricle. This must be done precisely if the heart is beating, in view of the possibility that air can be introduced into it and embolize to the brain unless the aorta has been clamped. Therefore, venous pressure is increased by reducing venous drainage to increase the volume of blood in the heart. A small incision is made within the purse string, and the venting catheter is introduced. After the venting catheter has been advanced into the left atrium, the left hand is placed behind the heart to palpate the tip of the vent and guide it toward the mitral valve and into the left ventricle. The same precautions with respect to air are necessary as the vent is withdrawn at the end of the operation.

For operations in the right atrium or right ventricle in which increased pulmonary venous return is anticipated, venting of the left heart can be performed as described in the previous paragraph. Alternatively, when two venous cannulae are used for operations in the right ventricle or right atrium, the caval tapes are secured after cooling has been initiated and the right atrium opened through a small oblique atriotomy. If a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect is present, a sump catheter is placed partially across it and into the left atrium. If neither is present, a stab wound is made in the fossa ovalis directly beneath the superior limbus. If this landmark is not used and the stab wound is imprecisely made, the vent may come to lie outside the heart rather than in the left atrium. Because the sump catheter lies only partially across the atrial septum, it removes both left and right atrial blood. The right atrium remains open during the repair.

If the right superior or inferior pulmonary vein is not accessible for venting, the pulmonary trunk and apex of the left ventricle are alternative sites. If the pulmonary trunk is used, a catheter or sump is inserted through a purse string in it immediately above the pulmonary valve. Drainage and decompression of the left heart may be suboptimal with this technique. If the left ventricle is to be vented directly, a pledgeted mattress suture of 2-0 or 3-0 polyester or polypropylene is placed near, but not at, the apex of the heart on the anterolateral wall, and a catheter or sump is introduced after the ventricle has been incised with a stab blade.

For operations in which the heart is not opened (e.g., CABG), the left heart can be vented through the ascending aorta proximal to the aortic clamp, using a needle vent that can be connected either to the venous line (gravity drainage) or directly to the reservoir of the pump-oxygenator using a roller pump.

### CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS DURING OPERATION AND REWARMING

When the desired perfusion flow rate is achieved, perfusate temperature is reduced, the aorta is clamped, and cardioplegic solution is infused (see Chapter 3). Cooling by the perfusate is continued until the nasopharyngeal temperature reaches the desired level, and then the perfusate temperature is stabilized at that level. A broad range of temperatures can be used. In most cases, the nasopharyngeal temperature should be lowered to at least 32°C. When the temperature is lowered to less than this level, perfusion flow rate can be safely reduced. For example, if 25°C is chosen, the flow can be safely reduced to 1.6 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> . Brief periods of lower flow may be used.

After completing most or all of the repair, rewarming is begun. It is usually at this point that preparation for myocardial reperfusion is commenced. The precise moment for commencing rewarming depends on the strategy used for myocardial management (see Chapter 3). For rewarming, the water in the heat exchanger is raised to 42°C; the arterial blood temperature should not exceed 39°C. It is advantageous but not essential to have the nasopharyngeal temperature at 37°C for about 10 minutes before CPB is discontinued, lest there be excessive downward drift of temperature in the postbypass period.

### DE-AIRING THE HEART

After completing the repair and as the cardiac chambers are closed or as CABG is being completed, the heart must be freed of as much air as possible before it begins to eject into the systemic circulation. Clinical studies have demonstrated a correlation between the number of gaseous microemboli and the severity of neuropsychological impairment after surgical procedures employing CPB.B43,P19 Thus, special maneuvers are necessary to avoid air embolism, as has clearly been demonstrated by intraoperative echocardiography.M23,O5,V1 The exact steps and sequences and the time of de-airing may vary, but the principles are well established:

■ The heart is filled with fluid (blood or electrolyte solution) before closing to minimize air entrapment.

- The heart must be reperfused and beating.
- Residual air is aspirated from the heart before allowing it to eject.
- The lungs are intermittently ventilated to express air from the pulmonary veins.
- Continuous suction is applied on a needle vent or catheter in the ascending aorta as the heart commences ejecting blood to retrieve any air that may have remained in the heart or pulmonary veins (alternatively, a freely bleeding stab wound may be used).H16

The exact technique used will depend in part on the method used for myocardial management (see Chapter 3). One technique can be illustrated with the procedure for aortic valve replacement:

- 1. As the suture line for aortic closure is being completed, suction on the left atrial vent is discontinued, and flow is reduced to allow the heart to fill with blood. If blood is not freely escaping from the most anterior portion of the aortotomy before completing this suture line, fluid (saline or Ringer's lactate) is injected into the opened aorta with a syringe. The suture line is completed. A needle vent connected to tubing from the pump-oxygenator is inserted into the ascending aorta. The anesthesiologist *gently* inflates the lungs to remove air from the pulmonary veins into the left atrium; vigorous inflation is inadvisable because when the lungs collapse, air can be drawn into the left ventricle through the still-opened aorta.
- 2. With a large-bore needle connected to a 20-mL syringe or to tubing from the pump-oxygenator, the left atrium is aspirated through its dome beneath the aorta. Air is almost invariably obtained. Aspiration is combined with gentle ventilation on two or three occasions until no further air appears. The left atrial appendage is inverted to evacuate air.
- 3. The heart is gently pulled forward and to the right, and needle aspiration of the left ventricular cavity is performed through the front of the left ventricular apex. This is a simple and effective way of removing the pocket of air that is almost always present at this site. The maneuver can be repeated several times.
- 4. The operating table is tilted, with the patient's head down.
- 5. Perfusion flow rate is temporarily reduced as the aortic clamp is slowly released. Blood and air are gently aspirated from the needle vent in the ascending aorta. Left ventricular overdistention must be prevented.
- 6. The left atrial vent is removed while the lungs are gently inflated, and the central venous pressure is slowly increased to evacuate any residual air. The purse-string suture is secured. The heart is electrically defibrillated if not already beating. The left ventricle is shaken with the left hand several times.
- 7. Central venous pressure is *slowly* raised by the perfusionist. The heart begins to eject. Air may then appear in the aortic vent suction line. When the central venous pressure has been elevated to 10 mmHg and the heart has ejected for several minutes, CPB flow is slowly reduced. The ventricle is again shaken, and CPB is discontinued.

8. The table is leveled. Suction on the aortic needle is reduced and then discontinued, the needle is removed, and the stitch is tied. These maneuvers should not be hurried. The longer the aortic needle vent is in use, the better, and it should not be removed until the heart has been ejecting well for some time.

Because small amounts of intracardiac air have a low probability of causing any detectable damage, adherence to a strict protocol for removal of air, such as the one described, will suffice for most patients.R18,T24 Transesophageal twodimensional echocardiography (TEE) is commonly used to monitor removal of air from the heart before CPB is discontinued. TEE enables the operating team to identify the presence of even small amounts of intracardiac and intraaortic air.F32,S25 The clinical benefit conferred by TEE during operations in which standard de-airing procedures are used has not been conclusively demonstrated. However, TEE is of particular value during operations employing small incisions, when the left-sided cardiac chambers are not fully mobilized, or when some of the usual maneuvers for removal of air, such as aspiration and manipulation of the left ventricle, cannot be used.

Flooding the operative field with carbon dioxide is used for displacing air from the cardiac chambers. Its use was first reported by Nichols and colleagues in 1988.N10 The theoretical value of this technique is that carbon dioxide will displace air from the operative field because it is a heavier gas and because carbon dioxide emboli, if they occur, are better tolerated than air emboli.K23 In a randomized trial of patients undergoing single valve surgery, the number of microemboli assessed by intraoperative TEE was significantly less in the left atrium, left ventricle, and ascending aorta among patients in whom carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation was used than in those in whom it was not.S36 The median number of detectable microemboli after CPB fell to zero 7 minutes after CPB vs. 19 minutes in the control group. CO2 may have an important role in operations performed through small incisions or during reoperative procedures, but the potential for inducing profound systemic hypercarbia and acidosis exists.B60,O1 Thus, frequent monitoring of arterial blood gases and electrolytes is necessary when the technique is used. Persson and colleagues have shown in vitro that efficient de-airing of a cardiothoracic wound by carbon dioxide insufflation depends on its flow and velocity.P14 To compensate for diffusion with the ambient air, they observed that the flow of carbon dioxide should be 5 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and the outflow velocity about 0.1 m · sec<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> or less to avoid turbulence in the wound. This was best obtainable with a gas diffuser apparatus (Cardiac Innovation AB).

### COMPLETING CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS

As rewarming is being completed, two temporary pacing wire electrodes are positioned on the lateral wall of the right atrium.W3 The bared end of the shielded wire electrode is secured to the atrium with 5-0 sutures or with small clips. In most patients, one or two pacing wire electrodes are similarly sutured to the right ventricular myocardium on the anterior or inferior surface.

When the patient has been rewarmed to a nasopharyngeal temperature of 37°C, perfusion flow rate is gradually decreased until the right and left atrial and aortic pressures are adequate, and CPB is then discontinued. The venous cannulae are removed and the purse-string sutures are tied. Protamine is administered slowly (see "Heparinization and Later Protamine Administration" earlier in this section).

### Positioning Chest Tubes

There is considerable surgeon-to-surgeon difference in the location and number of chest tubes placed before closure of the median sternotomy incision. In general, to avoid unnecessary bleeding, the tubes are placed after CPB is discontinued and protamine has been administered. If the pleural spaces have not been entered, then one or two tubes are placed. A single tube can be positioned in the anterior mediastinum and brought out through a stab wound in the midline just below the sternotomy incision. Alternatively, two tubes—one in the anterior mediastinum as described and one (an angled or flexible tube) in the inferior-posterior portion of the pericardial cavity—are brought out through stab wounds in the epigastric region on both sides of the midline. If a pleural space has been entered, as often occurs when the left internal thoracic artery is dissected from the parasternal area, a tube is positioned with the tip well posterior and inferior in the pleural space to ensure maximum removal of fluid. This tube can be brought out through the epigastrium in the midline below the sternotomy incision or through a stab wound on the lateral chest wall.

### COMPLETING OPERATION

After CPB is discontinued, aside from ensuring adequate hemodynamics, the surgeon's primary task is to obtain hemostasis. This should be accomplished in a systematic fashion. All cardiac and aortic suture lines and purse strings are inspected. Fine (4-0 or 5-0) single or pledgeted polypropylene sutures can be placed in the adventitia or epicardium to control bleeding from suture lines.

Generally, electrocautery suffices to control bleeding from the mediastinal tissues and around the sternum. Troublesome bleeding from the sternum itself can be managed by tying heavy, encircling, absorbable sutures around it. The wound should be closed only after hemostasis is secure.

The pericardium is generally left open after operations with CPB through a median sternotomy. A few sutures may, however, be placed at the upper end to partially cover a particularly prominent aorta or an aortic graft. Reoperations have not posed a major problem with this technique. Advantages of leaving the pericardium open are (1) good blood drainage into the pericardial cavity (and then out through the drainage tubes) from the mediastinal and substernal tissues, thus preventing hematomas from developing in that area; and (2) reduction (but not elimination) of the tendency of retained blood to produce a positive intrapericardial pressure, thus lowering ventricular transmural pressure (tamponade).

Secure closure of the sternum is critically important. Stainless steel wire sutures are used, with the most cephalad one or two placed through the manubrium, the next three or four through the sternum or around the sternum close to the bone, and the most inferior one or two through the sternum. Different sizes and types of stainless steel sutures are available to match the patient's size. The wires are twisted, not tied, to bring the sternum together; in adults, these are further twisted with an instrument to ensure that the sternal fragments are securely approximated. If the sternal edges are thin or fragmented, wire sutures can be passed vertically in the parasternal position in front of and behind the costal cartilages on one or both sides. These vertical sutures can then be incorporated into the closure by the transverse wire sutures.R17 Absorbable sutures are used for closing the muscles over the sternum and the linea alba. The skin is closed with a subcuticular absorbable suture or with metal staples.

Some patients have a suboptimal hemodynamic state as preparations are made to close the chest.J5 In most of them, the sternum should probably not be closed, because this frequently further depresses cardiac function. Rather, the sternum, subcutaneous tissue, and skin are left unsutured. An impervious sheet of silicone rubber can be fit into the cutaneous defect and sutured to the skin edges with a running monofilament suture. Alternatively, the wound can be packed loosely with sponges and covered by an impervious, sterile adhesive sheet. This maneuver is lifesaving in some patients.B24,F1,G10,J5,J11,M11,M34,O2,O8,R14,U1 Usually a secondary closure can be performed 24 to 48 hours later.

#### PUMP-OXYGENATOR

The available apparatus for CPB changes continually, but some general points are important.

#### Components

A *venous reservoir* is currently used and is positioned to provide adequate siphonage by gravity if gravity drainage is used.P5 Alternatively, the venous reservoir may be a hard-shell device providing for vacuum-assisted venous return. Such a reservoir allows escape of any air returning with the venous blood and provides storage of excess volume. This reservoir is generally incorporated within the housing of the oxygenator. Although useful, venous reservoirs substantially increase priming volume of the pump-oxygenator system.

The *oxygenator* is probably the most varied and yet most important part of the system, while at the same time it is probably the most damaging part of the extracorporeal apparatus. Microporous and true membrane oxygenators have advantages over bubble oxygenators and are currently indicated for cardiac surgery (see "Gas Exchange" under Controlled Variables in Section II).

An efficient *heat exchanger* is necessary. This may be integral within the oxygenator or freestanding. Integrated heat exchangers have generally been less efficient than freestanding ones, but they reduce priming volume.

The *arterial pump* is most commonly a roller pump. It should be adjusted before each perfusion so as to be slightly nonocclusive, and should be calibrated at frequent intervals so that the flow rate can be accurately established. A centrifugal pump may also be used.

The *arterial line pressure* in the pump-oxygenator must be continuously monitored. When this pressure exceeds 250 to 300 mmHg, risk of disruption of the arterial line and of cavitation in the region of the arterial cannula increases. A proper arterial line pressure is ensured by a properly positioned cannula of adequate size.

The advantages, disadvantages, and need for a low-porosity *filter* in the *arterial line* remain somewhat controversial.S7 A randomized study by Walker and colleagues (Walker DR, Blackstone EH, Kirklin JW, Karp RB, Kouchoukos NT, Pacifico AD, et al: unpublished data, 1976) showed good neuropsychiatric function (determined by specialized testing) in patients after CABG, whether or not a low-porosity arterial filter was present in the circuit. A similar study in patients undergoing open cardiotomy provided the same result.A22 However, studies using transcranial Doppler ultrasound have shown that gaseous microemboli, more prevalent with bubble than with membrane or hollow-fiber oxygenators, can be considerably reduced by 40-µm filters in the arterial line of the pump-oxygenator.B21,P3,P4,P19 Currently, routine use of a low-porosity filter of this type in the arterial line appears to be beneficial. The exact filter to be used and its compatibility with the other components of the pump-oxygenator must be determined within each institution performing cardiac surgery.

A *device for ultrafiltration* is incorporated into the circuit of the pump-oxygenator, usually between the cardiotomy reservoir and the arterial line. During CPB, if there is excess volume in the pump-oxygenator, the device is activated for removal of serum water by ultrafiltration (see "Perfusate" under Controlled Variables in Section II).

The CPB circuit generally should contain at least two *cardiotomy suction* ports for return of blood from the opened heart. This blood may contain particulate matter and boluses of air and must be passed through a low-porosity filter and defoamed in a separate chamber open to air before it is returned to the circuit. During the perfusion, blood should be promptly aspirated from the pericardium with these suckers. Blood left too long in the pericardium before being aspirated can promote thrombolysis. Ideally, these lines should be activated by a continuously and rapidly variable high-capacity vacuum system. Because this has so far proved to be impractical, roller pumps are used. With this system, when the open end of the line is blocked, the suction rapidly increases; this may damage either the tissue or the blood. Thus, constant monitoring of the roller pumps is necessary.

#### Priming Volume

Each component of the pump-oxygenator adds to the priming volume, which explains why many cardiac surgical groups are unwilling to add unessential components to their system. However, pump-oxygenator systems can be so oversimplified to reduce priming volume that safety may be compromised. Even with the most stringent efforts, the typical pumpoxygenator systems currently in use have a priming volume considerably larger than is ideal.

#### Miniaturized Cardiopulmonary Bypass Circuits

Miniaturized CPB circuits have been developed with the objective of reducing the damaging effects of conventional CPB. It is hypothesized that minimizing hemodilution and mechanical blood trauma will improve outcomes. These closed circuits with little or no blood/air contact consist of a controlled vortex blood pump and a membrane oxygenator as the only components. There is no venous reservoir and no integral cardiac suction device. The components, including the tubing, are heparin coated.

Clinical studies (nonrandomized) in patients undergoing CABG suggest that use of these circuits is associated with fewer transfusions of blood products, less release of cardiac troponin, less postoperative atrial fibrillation, a lower prevalence of acute kidney injury, suppression of thrombin generation and coagulofibrinolytic activation, and lower levels of IL-6 and SC5b-9.N4,W16

A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials comparing conventional CPB with miniaturized CPB circuits indicated that miniaturized circuits are associated with substantial reductions in neurologic injury, number of patients requiring transfusion of blood products, and peak cardiac troponin release (Table 2-6).Z1 No difference in early mortality was noted. The majority of patients had CABG, and the remainder had aortic valve replacement. A separate meta-analysis examined only the need for red blood cell transfusion and demonstrated an absolute risk reduction in this variable among patients undergoing CABG.B16,B17

### SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

#### One Versus Two Venous Cannulae

Use of a single two-stage venous cannula is optimal for many cardiac operations (CABG, aortic valve replacement, and in many instances mitral valve replacement) in adult patients and is widely practiced. The technique is likewise optimal in neonates, infants, and children when the entire repair (including closure of the cardiac chambers) is performed during hypothermic circulatory arrest.

A single venous cannula may also be used in operations in which part of the repair is done during circulatory arrest, but a portion is left to be performed during CPB. Although convenient, the method has some disadvantages. Unless assisted venous return is used, an air lock may occur in the venous line during operations within the right ventricle or

pulmonary trunk, with the air entering the right atrium through the tricuspid valve. When this happens, venous return to the pump-oxygenator stops abruptly, and blood floods the right side of the heart. The perfusionist must not reduce the perfusion flow rate, but instead the intracardiac sucker is positioned outside the heart to keep blood from overflowing from the pericardial well, while the air lock is moved down the venous line and expelled into the venous reservoir. Principles for use of the single venous cannula in this setting are the same as those already described, including the need for the tip of the cannula to be in the IVC while its side holes remain in the right atrium.

### Cardiopulmonary Bypass Established by Peripheral Cannulation

#### *Femoral Cannulation*

Closed-chest cannulation of the femoral artery and vein for CPB was practiced at the Mayo Clinic during the 1960s for establishing hypothermic circulatory arrest in patients undergoing intracranial operations.M21 It has since been used with increasing frequency to establish CPB before opening the sternum in reoperations in which there is a high probability of entering a cardiac chamber or major artery during sternotomy. In these situations, a vertical or oblique incision in the groin crease is made over the femoral vessels. After identifying the inguinal ligament and working just inferior to it, the common femoral artery and vein are dissected, and a tape is placed around each. After the patient has been heparinized, a clamp is placed on the distal common femoral artery, any branches are temporarily occluded with ligature loops or small clamps, a clamp is placed proximally, and a transverse incision is made between the clamps. An arterial cannula of appropriate size is inserted into the vessel and, as the proximal clamp is removed, is gently advanced. The tape is snugged down around the cannula using a tourniquet, and the cannula is connected to the arterial line of the pump-oxygenator with the usual precautions to eliminate air. A large (28F-32F) long cannula is similarly inserted into the common femoral vein. This cannula must be advanced over the sacral promontory and into the IVC.W13 When the right femoral vein is used, this is usually easily accomplished. If the left femoral vein is used, it is often necessary to first insert a guidewire, positioning the tip in the right atrium or the adjacent IVC, then a small-bore catheter which is passed over the wire, and then the venous cannula, which is inserted over the smaller catheter. After securing the tape and removing the smaller catheter and the guidewire, the cannula is connected to the venous line of the pump-oxygenator. Alternatively a twostage cannula can be inserted over a guidewire from either femoral vein, positioning the tip in the SVC under TEE guidance. The upper openings in the catheter are located in the SVC and lower openings in the IVC. This permits placement of caval tapes and opening of the right or left atrium.

### *Axillary Artery Cannulation*

Femoral artery cannulation may result in peripheral embolization, local thrombosis, or aortic dissection. Additionally, in the presence of an existing acute or chronic aortic dissection, retrograde flow from femoral artery cannulation may result in central malperfusion. An alternative is use of either axillary artery. Advantages include absence of malperfusion, establishment of brain blood flow during otherwise whole-body circulatory arrest, and presumably lack of retrograde particulate embolization. The axillary artery is exposed through a transverse incision below and parallel to the lateral two thirds of the clavicle. The pectoralis major muscle is divided in the direction of its fibers and the clavipectoral fascia incised, exposing the pectoralis minor muscle, which may be divided or retracted laterally. Using sharp dissection, the artery is dissected from surrounding tissue, taking care not to injure the branches of the brachial plexus. Proximal and distal control of the axillary artery is obtained. After administration of heparin, the artery can be cannulated directly.G13,S1 Alternatively, an 8- or 10-mm polyester or polytetrafluoroethylene graft is sutured end to side to the artery using a 6-0 polypropylene suture.G13,S1

#### *Other Sites*

Other less commonly used sites for cannulation include the brachial, brachiocephalic, and carotid arteries. Another option for cannulation in high-risk reoperative sternotomy patients is to expose the brachiocephalic artery by dissecting just above the sternal notch, and the IVC by dissecting just below the xiphoid. The skin incisions used are simply the upper and lower poles of the sternotomy incision. Cannulation of the brachiocephalic artery with an appropriate-sized arterial cannula, and the IVC with a large, right-angled, venous drainage cannula can provide full CPB support while the sternum is opened. This technique is particularly useful for patients weighing 40 kg or less, in whom these vessels are easily accessible, and in very small patients in whom peripheral cannulation is not practical.

#### *Indications*

Indications for peripheral cannulation have been expanded to include operations performed through small midline or lateral chest incisions (see "Alternative Primary Incisions" earlier in this section), resuscitation of preoperative and postoperative cardiac surgical patients, and support of high-risk patients during percutaneous catheter interventions.

Both arterial and venous cannulation can be accomplished by percutaneous techniques. In this setting, the pumpoxygenator should be used in conjunction with a controlled vortex pump or vacuum-assisted venous return, which permits use of smaller (22F or 24F) venous cannulae.

### Blood Conservation

Since the earliest days of clinical use of CPB, there has been concern about the relatively large amounts of allogeneic blood that often must be administered during and early after operations. This concern has been magnified by the prevalence of cardiac operations requiring CPB and the possibility of acquiring deadly diseases such as hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus. Methods of testing the suitability of donor blood have improved greatly; in well-regulated institutional settings, the current risk of acquiring such diseases from transfused blood is small (see Chapter 5).

A major reason for the near-routine use of non-blood solutions for initial priming of the pump-oxygenator is the desire to minimize use of allogeneic blood. Removal of 500 to 800 mL of blood from adult patients with hematocrits greater than 33% to 35% after induction of anesthesia is safe and is commonly performed. The blood is collected in bags containing CPD anticoagulant, as used by blood banks, and is left unrefrigerated in the operating room. (Refrigeration even for a short time renders platelets less effective.) This blood is not used during CPB, but rather is administered for its hemostatic and blood-volume effects after protamine is given and major bleeding has been controlled. Donation of blood by the patient several weeks before the operation, as well as by relatives and friends, is widely practiced. This blood has the disadvantages associated with stored blood.

The pump-oxygenator should incorporate one of the compact ultrafiltration devices currently available (see Pump-Oxygenator earlier in this section). This provides the capability of concentrating the blood left in the machine after CPB, including plasma proteins (in contrast to blood salvage systems), and preparing it for prompt administration to the patient.

Blood aspirated from the surgical field by a standard high-power sucker during and after the cardiac operation can be processed through a blood salvage system.M15 These systems separate, wash, and to some extent concentrate erythrocytes, which are then transfused to the patient. Anticoagulation is provided by heparin that is added to the apparatus. The components of plasma are lost. Postoperatively for about 12 hours, shed blood from the mediastinal and pleural tubes can be collected in the reservoir and returned intravenously to the patient.C31 This blood has been defibrinated in the patient before its collection and has the disadvantage of having essentially no clotting factors.

Most bleeding after cardiac surgery results from coagulation disturbances associated with CPB, related primarily to platelet dysfunction and activation of the fibrinolytic cascade (see Chapter 5 and Response Variables in Section II). Prophylactic administration of antifibrinolytic drugs (epsilonaminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid, and formerly aprotinin) decreases the frequency of reoperation for bleeding and need for allogeneic blood transfusions in patients after operations employing CPB.L9 Comparative studies have demonstrated equivalent effectiveness of these three agents.C4,L9,M3,M32,N15,W25 As mentioned earlier in this chapter, aprotinin was withdrawn from the market in May 2008.

### Left Superior Vena Cava

A left SVC presents no problems in operations in which a single venous cannula is used. When other techniques for venous cannulation are used, several options exist. A simple method is to use cannulae in the SVC and IVC and to pick up the left SVC flow by the sump-sucker that is positioned partially across the atrial septum (see Commencing Cardiopulmonary Bypass and Left Heart Venting earlier in this section) or in the coronary sinus ostium.

Alternatively, the left SVC may be occluded with a tourniquet for short periods when exposure in the right atrium is suboptimal. As another alternative, a pressure-monitoring needle may be inserted into the left SVC, or the pressure in the left jugular vein may be monitored. As a test, the left SVC is clamped below the needle (downstream). If the monitored pressure does not increase, it may be assumed that the vein can be safely occluded during CPB (see Chapter 58). If the pressure increases substantially, an additional cannula is inserted into the left SVC either via the right atrium and coronary sinus ostium or directly via a purse string where the vein enters the pericardium lateral to the left atrial appendage. The latter is most easily done after CPB has been established but before the right atrium is opened. It is essential if cardioplegic solution is to be delivered retrogradely into the coronary sinus. When three cannulae are in use, two Y connectors are required to connect the venous return to the single venous pump line.

### Other Systemic Venous Anomalies

Although a left SVC is the most common systemic venous anomaly that influences management of CPB, it is not the only one. Hepatic venous anomalies, which occur particularly in the various heterotaxy syndromes, can present similar challenges (see Chapter 58). The hepatic veins may attach to the right atrium or even the left atrium, independent of the IVC attachment. They may attach as a single confluent trunk or as several separate veins. The same concerns, considerations, and management options as described for the left SVC are applied to these anomalies.

### Left Atrial Pressure Monitoring

Knowledge of left atrial pressure both intraoperatively and postoperatively is important. The most direct way of measuring this pressure is to insert a fine polyvinyl catheter into the left atrium. There is danger of accidental introduction of air into the left atrial line and of cerebral embolization from a tiny thrombus on its tip, but these complications are rare. The only major complication has been occasional bleeding when the catheter is removed. This can be sufficient enough in infants to require immediate blood replacement and, rarely, reoperation. Even in neonates and infants, bleeding after removal has not been encountered when removal is delayed until at least 48 hours postoperatively.

A less satisfactory but more commonly used alternative is to introduce a catheter into the pulmonary artery for intraoperative and postoperative monitoring (as discussed earlier). Unless pulmonary vascular disease is present, the pulmonary artery diastolic pressure approximates mean left atrial pressure. Many groups routinely insert a Swan-Ganz catheter after induction of anesthesia, rather than using a left atrial catheter as described.

### Alternative Primary Incisions

### *Minimal Sternotomy and Thoracotomy*

Currently, a number of smaller incisions are being used for procedures on the cardiac valves, the ascending aorta and aortic arch, and the coronary arteries in adults, and for correction of congenital cardiac defects in children and in adults.A6,C15,C32,D18,G11,G32,G34,L5,L19 The various incisions used are shown in Fig. 2-23. They can be classified into three general types: a partial midline sternotomy (upper, lower, or middle), a parasternal incision with resection of one or more costal cartilages, and a more lateral approach through an intercostal space, with or without resection of a segment of costal cartilage or rib, and with or without partial or total transection of the sternum. The commonly used minimal incisions for CABG and for valve replacement or repair are described in Chapters 7, 11, 12, and 13.

Putative advantages of these less invasive incisions, when compared with the full sternotomy, include reduced blood loss, less pain and therefore a lowered requirement for analgesic agents, more rapid convalescence with

**Figure 2-23** Currently used sternotomy and thoracotomy incisions *(dashed lines)* for cardiac operations.

reduced hospital stay, reduced prevalence of infection, better cosmetic result, and lower overall costs. In a number of observational studies comparing minimal incisions with a full sternotomy, these advantages have not been consistently observed.A23,A24,B56,C7,G32,H8,L5,L17,S37,S38,S43,W5 In many instances, duration of CPB and total time of operation are prolonged with the minimal incisions. The resulting increase in operating room costs often offsets the reduced costs achieved by a shorter hospital stay.

It appears likely that the trend toward using smaller incisions will continue as new instruments and cannulae are developed that facilitate performing procedures on the heart and great vessels through smaller openings. However, until clear advantages of minimal incisions are demonstrated, full sternotomy should continue to be used. Cardiac surgeons must be competent and experienced in use of the full sternotomy before attempting procedures through small incisions. Furthermore, they must recognize that the potential or real advantages of small incisions may be outweighed by the disadvantages that can result from limited exposure.

### *Right Anterolateral Thoracotomy*

A right anterolateral thoracotomy through the fourth or fifth intercostal space may be used for cosmetic reasons in young women with developing breasts, for mitral and tricuspid valve operations, and for repair of atrial septal defects. It may also be used in patients who require reoperation only on the tricuspid valve and for reoperations on the mitral valve after one or more previous procedures. This approach provides excellent access to the left and right atria, although the field may be relatively restricted and cannulation of the ascending aorta may be difficult. When the aorta is inaccessible or when coronary artery bypass grafts have been anastomosed to the ascending aorta during a previous operation, the common femoral or axillary artery is used (see Cardiopulmonary Bypass Established by Peripheral Cannulation earlier in this section).

A double-lumen endotracheal tube is used to permit collapse of the right lung and enhanced exposure. The patient is positioned with the right side elevated 30 to 40 degrees. The right arm is flexed at the elbow and kept at the patient's side. The left arm lies at the side. Groin areas are draped into the operative field. The skin incision follows the intercostal space to be entered and extends laterally to the anterior axillary line. The intercostal muscle is divided and a retractor placed. The pleural cavity is entered and the intercostal muscles are further divided laterally beneath the skin incision if exposure is not optimal. The collapsed lung is gently retracted posteriorly, and the pericardium is incised vertically 1 to 2 cm anterior and parallel to the phrenic nerve. If cannulation of both venae cavae is required, the cannulae are inserted through purse-string sutures in the SVC and in the right atrial wall adjacent to the IVC. Alternatively, a long cannula can be positioned in the IVC after insertion in the common femoral vein, or a two-stage long cannula can be inserted in the femoral vein and the openings positioned in the SVC and IVC. The aorta is cannulated on its right anterolateral aspect. For primary operations, the remainder of the procedure is similar to a median sternotomy approach.

For reoperations on the mitral valve, particularly after previous CABG, cannulating and clamping the ascending aorta may not be possible. In this situation, myocardial management is accomplished by hypothermic fibrillation. Temperature of the perfusate is lowered until the heart fibrillates or until the nasopharyngeal temperature reaches 18°C to 22°C. At that temperature, an external fibrillator is applied to the myocardium to induce ventricular fibrillation. The heart must be maintained hypothermic and in a fibrillating state to avoid ejection of air into the ascending aorta. Rewarming is not initiated until the left atrium has been closed. A soft rubber catheter attached to a cardiotomy suction line is positioned in the left ventricle through the mitral valve or a prosthesis, and is brought out through the atriotomy incision. Continuous suction is applied to this catheter during rewarming to evacuate air from the left ventricle. The catheter is removed just before CPB is discontinued and the left atrial suture line is secured.

### *Left Thoracotomy*

A left thoracotomy may be used for primary or reoperative mitral valve replacement or repair,R28,S44,S4S and coronary artery bypass grafting (See Technique of Operation in Chapter 7). For mitral valve procedures, a standard posterolateral thoracotomy or minithoracotomy through the fourth or fifth intercostal space and a vertical incision in the left atrium anterior to the left pulmonary veins provide excellent exposure of the mitral annulus and valve. The procedure can be performed on a beating heart,S45 with hypothermic fibrillation (see preceding Section),S44 or with aortic occlusion and administration of cardioplegia.R28,S44 Peripheral cannulation is generally used (see earlier Section).

#### *Port Access*

Thorascopic, then robotically assisted, cardiac surgery through small thoracotomies and ports was introduced by Carpentier and colleagues in early 1996; length of incision for the first case was 5 cm. Subsequently, the technology has progressed to multiple degrees of freedom instrumentation,C3 threedimensional imaging, and 3- to 4-cm port incision.L8 Conventional anesthesia is used with dual-lumen endotracheal intubation as for the anterolateral thoracotomy incision. CPB is established with peripheral cannulation (femoral artery and vein or venous cannulation via right internal jugular vein). The aorta is occluded either by an endoballoon or a transthoracic clamp,C14 and antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia are administered. For mitral valve repair, Mihaljevic, Gillinov, and colleagues insert the left arm of the robot through the third intercostal space in the anterior axillary line, the right arm through the fifth intercostal space in the midaxillary line, a working port in the fourth intercostal space in the midaxillary line, and a dynamic left atrial retractor in the midclavicular line.M22 Challenges of port-access surgery have led to a number of innovations, including new methods for mitral valve repair, arrested heart and beating heart CABG, atrial fibrillation surgery, epicardial lead placement for cardiac resynchronization, removal of cardiac tumors, atrial septal defect closure, and hybrid aortic valve replacement.L8

Port access procedures have permitted patients to proceed from surgery to a postanesthesia recovery unit rather than intensive care unit (Cleveland Clinic), with early extubation and shorter hospital stay than with conventional surgery via full sternotomy, partial sternotomy, or anterior thoracotomy,M22 and with more rapid return to work (Jarrett C, Mihaljevic T: personal communication, 2010).

## **Section IV Clinical Methodology of Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest and Its Alternatives**

### GENERAL COMMENTS AND STRATEGY

#### Adults

Hypothermic circulatory arrest is widely used in adults for operations involving the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta. For operations involving the distal ascending aorta and aortic arch, it is used in conjunction with hypothermic CPB to provide brain protection and optimal exposure of the brachiocephalic vessels and proximal descending thoracic aorta. For operations involving the descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta, it has been used in conjunction with hypothermic CPB, not only to provide brain protection and optimal exposure but also to eliminate the need to place occlusion clamps on the thoracic aorta, which reduces the risk for embolization of arteriosclerotic debris into the vasculature of the brain, kidneys, abdominal viscera, and lower extremities. Opinions differ regarding its use in these situations, because alternative methods of treatment exist. No studies to date have demonstrated the superiority of one technique over another. The various methods are discussed in detail in Chapter 24. Safe time limits of the arrest period are discussed in Section I of this chapter.

### Neonates, Infants, and Children

Opinions differ regarding appropriate use of hypothermic circulatory arrest in the pediatric population. A 2003 survey of members of the Congenital Heart Surgeon's Society indicated that about one third of respondents avoid using hypothermic circulatory arrest, and the frequency of use among the remaining respondents varied widely.U2

In previous eras, hypothermic circulatory arrest was *essential* for completing certain operations, such as neonatal operations requiring aortic arch reconstruction and a wide spectrum of other complex operations on neonates. Consensus opinion in the field also held that hypothermic circulatory arrest was a *reasonable option* for other operations, including most complex operations on full-term neonates and infants. Hypothermic circulatory arrest, however, was considered an *unreasonable option* for a large spectrum of congenital heart operations, including all simple operations regardless of age, and most if not all complex operations on older infants and children unless aortic arch reconstruction was involved.

In the current era, with technical- and equipment-related advances, it has been clearly established that all operations in neonates, infants, and children can now be performed using CPB strategies that do not use hypothermic circulatory arrest, but rather, continuous perfusion.A20,F21,M4,P16,T16,T33 Hypothermic circulatory arrest is not essential for any operation, and becomes only one of several options for all operations. Currently, the primary alternative to hypothermic circulatory arrest is continuous full-body CPB for all operations not involving aortic arch repair, and continuous antegrade cerebral perfusion for operations involving aortic arch repair.H12,M4 The technique of continuous full-body CPB is described in detail in Section III. Continuous antegrade cerebral perfusion is described in this section. Controversy exists regarding the relative merits of both of these continuous perfusion techniques when used as alternatives to hypothermic circulatory arrest.A14,F33

There are two major criteria for judging the efficacy of continuous full-body CPB and continuous antegrade cerebral perfusion relative to hypothermic circulatory arrest. First, in those operations that have traditionally utilized hypothermic circulatory arrest, continuous full-body CPB and continuous antegrade cerebral perfusion must achieve technical outcomes equal to or better than those using hypothermic circulatory arrest. Sufficient data have been accumulated over the last decade to confirm that this criterion is metA20,F21,M4,P16,T16,T33: All operations in neonates and infants, including those involving aortic arch reconstruction, can be performed using continuous CPB, including continuous antegrade cerebral perfusion when necessary, with technical outcomes that are at least as good as those achievable using hypothermic circulatory arrest.M4 Second, continuous full-body CPB and continuous antegrade cerebral perfusion must preserve end-organ structure and function, particularly with respect to the brain, as well as or better than hypothermic circulatory arrest. This is a complex and controversial criterion with no definitive resolution at this time, and readers are referred to an editorial by HanleyH12 that addresses the issue in depth. To date, no well-designed multicenter studies have addressed it.

### TECHNIQUE IN ADULTS

The technique for establishing hypothermic circulatory arrest in adult patients is described in detail in Chapter 26 under "Aortic Arch Replacement" and "Thoracoabdominal Aorta Replacement."

### TECHNIQUE IN NEONATES, INFANTS, AND CHILDREN

### Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest

### *Preparation for Cardiopulmonary Bypass*

Preparation of the patient is the same as described for CPB in general (see Section III). Historically, surface cooling was used as an adjunct to core cooling. Now, most institutions use a cooling blanket and pack ice around the head. These maneuvers, plus a cool operating room, usually reduce the patient's body temperature to 30°C to 32°C by the time CPB is initiated. The ice bags remain in place around the head until perfusion rewarming is begun after the period of circulatory arrest.

### *Cannulation*

The aortic cannula is inserted into the ascending aorta in the usual manner. In some cases, particularly in infants, it is inserted near or into the brachiocephalic artery. It is critically important to remember that although the purse string around the aortic cannula may be hemostatic, it does not protect against the passage of air. This is important because when CPB is temporarily discontinued to establish circulatory arrest, the arterial pump may be sufficiently nonocclusive that suction initiated by gravity develops in the arterial system. With the aorta at essentially zero pressure, such suction draws air into the aorta and the cannula from the site of cannula insertion. The purse-string suture cannot be made snug enough to prevent this. Therefore, just before CPB is discontinued, the perfusionist clamps the arterial tubing and then discontinues CPB, making suction-driven air entry impossible because the arterial system has been "pressurized." Just as CPB is recommenced, the perfusionist removes the clamp. These precautions are unnecessary if a clamp is placed on the aorta *distal* to the aortic cannula. The aortic cannula can then be used for delivery of cardioplegic solution.

Commonly, a single venous cannula is used (see "Siting and Purse-String Sutures for Venous Cannulation" and "One Versus Two Venous Cannulae" in Section III). Two venous cannulae and caval tapes may be used even if the patient weighs less than 3 kg. This allows maximal flexibility. The caval tapes are often left loose and then tightened during cooling and periods of low flow. Some procedures can be performed at low flow rate with a single venous cannula.

### *Cardiopulmonary Bypass for Cooling*

After CPB is established, cooling is begun as described in Section III. Relatively high CPB flows, 2.2 to 3.0 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , are used. The nasopharyngeal temperature in neonates and infants can sometimes decrease to 18°C within 10 minutes. However, rapid cooling has been demonstrated to be suboptimal for circulatory arrest (see "Characteristics of the Cooling Process" in Section I), probably because it is not homogeneous. Therefore, the cooling period should last at least 20 minutes and may at times approach 30 minutes.

The target temperature and its most appropriate site of measurement remain controversial (see "Brain Function and Structure: Risk Factors for Damage" in Section I). A nasopharyngeal temperature of 16°C to 18°C is a reasonable criterion to establish circulatory arrest.

Management of gas exchange during cooling is also controversial. The two management options, pH-stat and alphastat, each have advantages and disadvantages (see "Arterial Carbon Dioxide Pressure" in Section II). In any event, arterial PCO2, and thus arterial pH—the important variables—are quite controllable with membrane oxygenators and online measurement of arterial pH and PCO2. Mounting evidence suggests that pH-stat management results in superior neurologic outcome.B13,K14,P11

Hematocrit should not be allowed to drop below 0.25 throughout the operation. Although this variable has not been studied in enough detail to develop a linear relationship between hematocrit level and risk of neurologic injury, evidence suggests that levels of 0.20 result in greater neurologic injury than levels of 0.25, and there is no improvement with higher hematocrit levels.J9,N7

During cooling, dilatation of the heart must be avoided. It may be necessary to manipulate the position of the venous cannulae to ensure adequate drainage. A single infusion of cardioplegic solution will usually suffice if circulatory arrest does not exceed 30 minutes.

### *Circulatory Arrest*

Time constraints of safe circulatory arrest are discussed in Section I. There is no secure evidence that interposing a short period of CPB increases safe duration of circulatory arrest, presumably because cerebral blood flow is low early after resumption of CPB and presumably inhomogeneously distributed under that conditionS39 (see Fig. 2-3). However, when time constraints are anticipated, intermittent perfusion to interrupt hypothermic circulatory arrest may be useful.L3

#### *Cardiac Operation*

The right atrial cannula is often removed from the heart. If arch reconstruction is part of the operation, the aortic cannula is removed as well. The heart and great arteries are opened where appropriate, and repair is performed. The right atrium is usually opened to close any atrial communication, including a patent foramen ovale, or to perform atrial septectomy, as appropriate. When the intracardiac repair is completed, the cardiotomy is closed.

#### *Rewarming*

The aortic and right atrial cannulae are inserted through the previous purse strings (if arch reconstruction is performed, depending on what reconstructive technique is used, a new arterial purse string may be needed). Extreme care should be taken to ensure that air entry into the aorta does not occur at the initiation of perfusion. Precise details of rewarming with CPB and time of its initiation, myocardial management, cardiac de-airing, and removal of the aortic clamp are highly interrelated and primarily dependent on the method of myocardial management. Each surgical group should determine these protocols individually, using the principles described in this chapter and in Chapter 3.

### Continuous Antegrade Cerebral Perfusion

### *Preparation for Cardiopulmonary Bypass*

This technique is reserved for operations in which aortic arch reconstruction or important aortic manipulation is to be performed. Preparation of the patient is the same as described for CPB in general (see Section III), with a few notable exceptions and areas of emphasis. Regional cerebral oxygen monitoring using near-infrared spectroscopy is performed routinely and has been shown to be beneficial.V16 To achieve a technically precise repair using continuous CPB, exposure is of prime importance. The skin incision is taken to the sternal notch, with a retraction stitch placed at the upper pole of the incision. The thymus, when present, is completely resected. It is critical to both mobilize the brachiocephalic vein in its entirety and to open the fascia above the vein to fully expose the brachiocephalic artery. The dissection is continued by complete mobilization of the three major arch vessels and the ductus arteriosus. Mobilizing the left pulmonary artery to the pericardial reflection facilitates exposure of the aorta distal to the ductus arteriosus (if present).

### *Cannulation*

Arterial cannulation is accomplished by direct cannulation of the brachiocephalic artery,M4 although alternative methods exist.T16 The arterial purse string is placed inferior to the brachiocephalic vein while retracting the vein superiorly, using 6-0 polypropylene suture (Fig. 2-24). Care is taken to limit the width of the purse string to prevent narrowing the artery. For cases of interrupted aortic arch, a second arterial purse string is placed into the pulmonary trunk in preparation for lowerbody perfusion through the ductus arteriosus. Standard setup also involves placing purse strings in the superior vena cava (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC) for bicaval venous cannulation, and in the right superior pulmonary vein for venting.

A 6F or 8F arterial cannula is selected for neonates, based on the patient's weight and brachiocephalic artery size. Larger cannulae are used for larger patients. Before insertion, the obturator is withdrawn until it is flush with the catheter tip (Fig. 2-25). The artery is carefully cannulated to avoid obstructing flow in the brachiocephalic artery. Typically, the artery is opened with a fine-blade knife and the cannula placed directly, without using a vascular clamp. The cannula is advanced to the start of the wire spiral and no farther than 2 mm. The arterial line is then rigorously de-aired.

The cavae are cannulated with right-angled 12F venous drainage cannulae (for neonates weighing 2.0 kg or more), and CPB is initiated at a flow rate of 200 mL · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . The IVC cannula is initially oriented superiorly into the atrium to avoid any potential obstruction of lower-body venous return at these high flow rates. A vent is placed into the left side of the heart through the right upper pulmonary

vein purse string. Next, the ductus arteriosus is temporarily occluded with a snare. The ductus is permanently ligated when lower-body perfusion is assured, as judged by an appropriate drop in rectal temperature. In the case of interrupted aortic arch, or in the rare case that lower-body perfusion is inadequate for patients with hypoplastic left heart physiology or aortic coarctation, the ductal snare is loosened, the branch pulmonary arteries are snared, and a second arterial cannula is placed into the main pulmonary artery for direct lowerbody perfusion via the ductus, similar to the method described earlier for interrupted aortic arch.

### *Cardiopulmonary Bypass and Cooling*

Once CPB is initiated and adequate venous drainage is confirmed, the patient is cooled to 22°C to 24°C for a minimum of 15 minutes to ensure uniform cooling of the central nervous system. The acid-base status is initially managed according to an alpha-stat strategy, and the perfusate hematocrit is maintained between 25% and 30%. After the cooling period is completed, flow is reduced to 120 mL · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , and the IVC cannula is redirected downward into the IVC. The aorta is clamped and cardioplegia administered through the aortic root in an antegrade fashion. This is achieved using a standard neonatal cardioplegia needle in cases of interrupted aortic arch, coarctation, and Damus-Kaye-Stansel procedure, and using a 22-gauge angiocatheter in cases of hypoplastic left heart physiology with very small ascending aorta. Snares are placed around the two vena caval cannulae.

### *Preparation for Cerebral Perfusion*

The arch vessels are now prepared for cerebral perfusion. The brachiocephalic artery, left carotid artery, and left subclavian artery are each individually clamped with atraumatic neurovascular clips (Fig. 2-26). At this point, direct perfusion is isolated to the head and right arm, the flow rate is reduced to 40 mL · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> , and acid-base management shifts to pH-stat. The ductus arteriosus is now formally ligated and transected (as appropriate), and the descending aorta, which has been extensively mobilized previously, is clamped distally.

#### *Arch Reconstruction*

At this point, any type of arch reconstruction can be performed. Specifics of the repair are tailored to the particular morphologic lesion. Associated intracardiac anomalies can be repaired during continuous antegrade cerebral perfusion; however, the preferred method is to reestablish total body perfusion (as described in the following text) after the arch repair, and then proceed with the intracardiac component of the repair.

![](_page_52_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 2-26** Position of arterial cannula for CPB and subsequent continuous antegrade cerebral perfusion. As described in text, arch vessels will eventually be clipped (using neurovascular clips) as continuous antegrade cerebral perfusion is established. (From Malhotra and Hanley.<sup>M4</sup>)

### Reestablishing Total Body Perfusion and Associated Intracardiac Repairs

After the arch reconstruction is completed, the descending aorta is unclamped. The neurovascular clips on the base of the brachiocephalic artery and the other arch vessels are also removed. Flow is increased to 120 to 150 mL · kg<sup>-1</sup> · min<sup>-1</sup>, reestablishing total body perfusion. If no additional repairs are needed other than arch reconstruction, reestablishment of total body perfusion coincides with myocardial reperfusion. If any remaining intracardiac lesions are present, a standard aortic clamp is placed on the ascending aorta before the descending aortic clamp and the neurovascular clip on the brachiocephalic artery are removed. Additional cardioplegia is administered as necessary according to the general guidelines outlined in Chapter 3, and the intracardiac repair is performed.

#### Rewarming

After the arch repair (or combined arch and intracardiac repair) is completed, reestablishment of myocardial perfusion, de-airing, and rewarming are begun, again following general guidelines outlined in Section III of this chapter and in Chapter 3. Snares around the vena caval cannulae are removed, and the IVC cannula is again repositioned up into the right atrium. CPB flow rate is increased to 200 mL · kg<sup>-1</sup>, and the patient is rewarmed using an alpha-stat strategy. Once normothermia is achieved, the patient is weaned from CPB support and the caval cannulae removed. To prevent obstruction or arterial thrombosis, it is important to remove the arterial cannula from the brachiocephalic artery immediately after separation from CPB.

# **Equations**

The equation derived from the data in Fig. 2-1 is:

$$log_{10}\dot{V}o_2 = -0.69 \pm 0.061 + 0.043 \pm 0.0021 \cdot temperature$$
 (2A-1)

where P for intercept and slope < .0001, SD of regression = 0.12, and  $r^2 = .80$ .

Correlation ( $r^2$ ) of the data in Fig. 2-15 to a linear model<sup>S27</sup> was .39; to a log-log model<sup>H20</sup> .54; to the Arrhenius<sup>P5</sup> equation (log  $\dot{V}o_2$  proportional to flow<sup>-1</sup>) .52; and to a hyperbolic model.69. The equation for Fig. 2-15 is:

$$1 \, / \, \dot{V}o_2 = 0.0062 \pm 0.00024 + 0.0044 \pm 0.00020 \cdot \dot{Q}^{-1} \eqno(2A-2)$$

where  $\dot{V}o_2$  is oxygen consumption (mL·min<sup>-1</sup>·m<sup>-2</sup>) at 37°C;  $\dot{Q}$  is perfusion flow rate (L·min<sup>-1</sup>·m<sup>-2</sup>) during CPB; P for intercept and slope < .0001; SD of regression = 0.0024; and  $r^2 = .69$ .

The equation represented by the nomogram in Fig. 2-11 is:

$$\begin{split} 1 \mathop{/} \dot{V} o_2 &= 0.168 \cdot 10^{-0.0387 \cdot T} + 0.0378 \cdot \dot{Q}^{-1} \cdot 10^{-0.0253 \cdot T} \\ &\qquad (2A\text{--}3) \end{split}$$

where T is temperature in °C. This was derived as follows. The relationship between  $\dot{V}o_2$  and  $\dot{Q}$  at 37°C was established from published animal experimental data (Fig. 2-15 and Equation 2A-2). Fox and colleagues established these relationships at 20°C in humans during CPB. F19 The equation is:

$$1/\dot{V}_{O_2} = 0.0284 + 0.0118 \cdot \dot{Q}^{-1}$$
 (2A-4)

In mating these for the curves at intermediate temperatures, the first coefficient in Equation 2A-3 (relating to maximum  $\dot{V}o_2$  at limitless flow) followed  $Q_{10}$ , which happened to be 2.4. The second coefficient (relating  $\dot{Q}$  slope change to temperature) followed a  $Q_{10}$  of 1.8. Both the experimental data at 37°C and the data of Fox and colleagues at 20°C are described by Equation 2A-3.

The logistic equation for Fig. 2-6 is:

$$z = -7.3 \pm 1.56 + 0.08 \pm 0.026 \cdot \text{TCA}$$
 (2A-5)

where *TCA* is circulatory arrest time (minutes), *P* for intercept < .0001, and *P* for TCA = .002. Also, among the 211 patients without such events, TCA time was 42 ±14.0 (SD) minutes, compared with 59 ±10.2 for the 8 patients with such events (*P* = .0008).
