## **Section I Bradycardia**

#### DEFINITION

Abnormal bradycardia is a slow cardiac rate that results chronically or episodically in inadequate cardiac output or life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.

#### HISTORICAL NOTE

During the early 1700s, peripheral pulsations of the circulation began to be timed, and in 1717 Gerbezius recognized bradycardia as a deviation from the usual pulse rate.G8 Morgagni is believed to have surmised the relationship between bradycardia and syncope in 1761, but he attributed both to melancholy.M24 In 1827, Adams accurately described what became known as *Adams-Stokes syndrome* and proposed that it had a cardiac origin.A3 This idea was not well accepted until Stokes, in 1846, collected reports of seven patients with the condition and agreed with Adams' concepts.S30 The phrase *maladie de Adams-Stokes* was originated in 1899 by Huchard.H24

Understanding the morphologic basis of Adams-Stokes syndrome began after Harvey's description of the cardiac cycle.H10 Cardiac conduction tissues were first described by Purkinje in 1845, which he mistook as cartilage tissue.P16 The atrioventricular (AV) conduction bundle was described by His in 1893H17 and in 1896, Aschoff and Tawara described the AV node and its connection to the His bundle.T1 Then in 1907, Keith and Flack described the sinoatrial, or sinus, nodeK7; its function was demonstrated in 1906 by Einthoven.E4

It has long been known that the heart responds to external electrical stimulation. As long ago as 1804, Aldini successfully stimulated systole in the hearts of decapitated criminals.A4 Apparently it was known during the late 1800s that direct heart puncture with or without injecting drugs would occasionally produce effective cardiac contractions. Mond reported that in 1929, Lidwill in Australia successfully paced the heart of a stillborn infant for a time by direct ventricular puncture.M21 In 1932, Hyman atrially paced several patients with what he termed an *artificial pacemaker*, and Bigelow and colleagues in Toronto paced canine hearts by esophageal and precordial electrodes in 1950.B9,H25

In 1952 in Boston, Zoll reported successfully pacing hearts of patients with complete heart block with external cutaneous electrodes and a large and relatively nonmobile pulse generator.Z2 This method was the only one available when intracardiac surgery came into existence during the mid-1950s, and although stimulation of each heartbeat was accompanied by skeletal muscle contractions, and skin under the electrodes quickly became excoriated, this method kept some cardiac surgical patients alive until sinus rhythm returned. However, for patients in whom sinus rhythm did not return, the agony of skeletal muscle contractions and skin excoriations increased as the days passed. Sheer terror developed with approach of the surgeon who would each day provoke an Adams-Stokes episode by turning off the pacer to see whether an adequate idioventricular rhythm, let alone sinus rhythm, would replace the electrocardiographic image of P waves without any QRS complex.

Change began when Lillehei, in Minneapolis, enlisted the help of Earl Bakken, a television engineer and later founder of Medtronics Corporation, in developing a small portable pacemaker. More importantly, he devised the technique of leaving a wire attached to the ventricular epicardium at operation and bringing it out externally. The external electrode was used to pace the heart with minimal patient discomfort.W6 Later, Thevenet, Hodges, and Lillehei devised a method of inserting the wire into the ventricle through a needle passed through the skin over the precordium without an operation.T2 These systems used a portable pacemaker system devised by Bakken.

In 1959, Elmquist and Senning in Stockholm reported placing the first totally implantable pacemaker system using epicardial electrodes.E7 This advance was made possible by invention of transistors during the 1950s. In 1960, Chardack, Gage, and Greatbatch described a self-contained, implantable pulse generator driven by a mercury cell battery for use with implanted epicardial leads.C5

During the previous year, Furman and Robinson had reported the use of endocardial electrodes introduced transvenously rather than epicardially.F14 Their data supported the idea that endocardial and epicardial electrodes perform similarly. This led to widespread availability by 1961 of both endocardial electrodes inserted transvenously and epicardial electrodes inserted by thoracotomy. These early pacemakers paced at a set rate and did not sense spontaneous cardiac activity. They were crude by present standards but allowed 85% of patients having Adams-Stokes episodes to survive for at least 1 year, in contrast to less than 50% before their introduction.

Rapid developments followed, and pulse generators that sensed the QRS and fired only when no spontaneous QRS occurred within a specified time became available during the mid-1960s. Much work led by Greatbatch during the late 1960s and early 1970s to improve the cells (batteries) resulted in commercial availability of lithium cell–powered pulse generators during the early 1970s. The lithium cells were much more reliable and, with hydrogen gas no longer being liberated in the pulse generator, hermetic sealing of the entire device became possible. More complicated electronic circuits were developed to permit programming of rate and stimulus duration as well as better QRS sensing as transistorized circuits with a few components evolved into hybrid circuits with more components, into integrated circuits, and finally into implantable pulse generators containing microprocessors.

Further improvements permitted atrial sensing and pacing as well as ventricular sensing and pacing (universal pacing) and ventricular pacing synchronized with the patient's atrial contractions, and sequential AV pacing.L13 Currently available pacemakers provide sensing of either body motion or increase in respirations and use the information to alter pacing rate appropriate for patient activity. Finally, the combination of multiprogrammability with diagnostic radio and telephonic transmission has permitted accurate evaluation of pacemaker function and noninvasive adjustment of pacemaker variables for optimal treatment of the patient.

Improvements in pacing electrodes have been made through the years in the form of better wire alloys, antifracture characteristics, electrode pacing threshold properties, and lead insulation. These improvements have diminished the occurrence of high pacing thresholds and lead fracture.

#### MORPHOLOGY

Abnormal bradycardia may be the result of complete heart block, a condition in which P waves (atrial depolarization) occur at a constant interval but are unrelated to the less frequently occurring or absent and often broad QRS complexes (ventricular depolarization).

#### Heart Block

Complete heart block may be present at birth or develop later in life.

#### *Congenital Complete Heart Block*

Musculature of the atrial septum may be congenitally deficient near the AV valves, such that there is a diminished or absent connection between the atria and the AV node. Lev described morphologic discontinuity between AV node and bundle of His as another basis for congenital complete heart block in otherwise normal hearts.L3 In hearts with AV discordant connections, complete heart block may be present at birth, presumably related to these same mechanisms.

#### *Spontaneously Developing Complete Heart Block*

Some congenital anomalies of the bundle of His may predispose patients to developing complete heart block. Thus, in hearts with AV discordant connection, unusually long length of the bundle of His is believed to predispose it to fibrosis and loss of function.

Certain disease processes may damage the conduction system. Calcification of the aortic valve may extend into the underlying ventricular septum and damage the bundle of His by a shearing effect during certain phases of the cardiac cycle. Mitral calcification does the same less commonly. Acute coronary occlusions resulting in posteroinferior myocardial infarctions may be associated with temporary AV node ischemia and heart block.

An increase in fibrous tissue of the bundle of His and its branches, accompanied by a decrease in number of conduction fibers, seems to be part of the aging process. Progressive fibrosis and fiber loss in left and right bundle branches and resultant heart block (Lev disease, Lenegre disease) may represent acceleration of this process. Anteroseptal myocardial infarctions produce ischemic necrosis in and around right and left bundle branches and may result in permanent heart block. Chronic ischemic heart disease can gradually result in septal fibrosis, with loss of function in both bundle branches. Dilated cardiomyopathy (see "Dilated Cardiomyopathy" in Section II of Chapter 20) may be associated with long-standing left ventricular fibrosis that may involve the bundle branches and produce complete heart block.

#### *Surgically Induced Complete Heart Block*

During surgical procedures for repair of ventricular septal defects (isolated or as part of tetralogy of Fallot and other complexes; see Chapters 35, 38, and 52 through 56) or AV septal defects (see Chapter 34), resection of discrete subvalvar aortic stenosis (see Chapter 47), and replacement of the mitral, aortic, or tricuspid valves (see Chapters 11 through 14), the bundle of His or contiguous AV node may be severed or sutured. In the absence of such direct injuries, the conduction bundle or AV node may be functionally damaged by hemorrhage, with resultant complete heart block. Although fibrosis must develop in these surgical areas late postoperatively, it is interesting that complete heart block is rare late after operation.

#### Other Bradycardias

#### *Sinus Node Dysfunction*

Important sinus node dysfunction may develop without identifiable morphologic changes in the node.D6 Loss of sinus node cells normally associated with aging may accelerate and cause dysfunction, especially in patients with a subnormal nodal cell population at birth. Amyloid deposition may occur within the sinus node and produce dysfunction.

Direct damage to the sinus node by surgical procedures occurs but is uncommon. Damage to the sinus node can result in a junctional rhythm that becomes slower as time passes. In the absence of direct injury, surgical procedures in the region of the sinus node, such as the atrial switch operation (see "Atrial Switch Operation" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 52) and Fontan operation (see "Technique of Operation" in Section IV of Chapter 41), may result in late perinodal fibrosis, with consequent loss of sinus node function. This process may be due to damage to the sinus node artery. The transseptal approach to the left atrium, which often involves an incision in the roof of the right atrium and division of the sinus node artery, can also result in temporary or permanent sinus node dysfunction.

#### *Dysfunction of Pathways between Sinus and Atrioventricular Nodes*

Preferential conduction pathways between the sinus and AV nodes may be interrupted by congenital absence of electrical continuity in these areas.L3

Surgical procedures, especially atrial switch and Fontan operations, may rarely damage preferential conduction pathways immediately. More commonly, late postoperative fibrosis develops and interferes with conduction along these pathways, and a slow junctional rhythm results.

#### CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

#### Pathophysiology

#### *Hemodynamic Effects*

Although blood flow into the aorta and large arteries is intermittent (pulsatile), the combined effects of the aortic valve, elasticity of the aorta and great arteries, and characteristics of the arterial distributing system make flow rate relatively constant in capillaries. Thus, cells of the brain and other organs receive continuous nutrient flow. The magnitude of this flow is related to, among other things, net forward flow across the aortic valve with each ventricular systole and heart rate. When the stroke volume is large and heart rate slow, as in trained athletes at rest, elasticity of the aorta and its filling during systole are sufficient to maintain an adequate volume of runoff during a long diastolic period, and thus an adequate nutrient flow to cells of the brain and other organs. When stroke volume is not large, runoff during the late part of chronically long diastolic periods may be inadequate to maintain the proper internal milieu of cells of the brain and other organs. Because the brain is particularly sensitive to hypoxia, cerebral symptoms usually develop before those from dysfunction of other organs.

#### *Cardiac Electrophysiologic Effects*

The longer the intervals between periodic depolarizations of ventricular myocardium, the greater the degree of QT prolongation and the higher the likelihood of developing ventricular extrasystoles or tachycardia or both, especially of the torsades de pointes variety (long QT syndrome).M25 Thus, bradycardia predisposes the patient to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Furthermore, with complete heart block, there is the possibility of prolonged ventricular asystole.

#### Symptoms

Clinical manifestations of first-degree heart block (PR interval > 0.2 second in adults) are rare. Second-degree heart block (intermittent lack of AV conduction1 ) may be manifested by bradycardia and symptoms. In third-degree (complete) heart block (all atrial impulses fail to be conducted to the ventricle), bradycardia is present, and symptoms are frequent.

About 80% of patients (particularly those with sinoatrial disorder [sick sinus syndrome]) have no symptoms when first seen, but eventually become symptomatic.L11,S19 Syncope is the predominant symptom, but palpitations, dyspnea, and angina also occur.R4,S24 Approximately a quarter of patients with sinus node dysfunction have ischemic heart disease.O12,S24

#### Diagnostic Criteria

Bradycardias are diagnosed largely by electrocardiographic (ECG) criteria.

#### *Atrioventricular Block*

Complete AV block and symptomatic incomplete AV block (such as 2:1 second-degree AV block) are diagnosed by standard ECG. When paroxysmal AV block is suspected as the cause of symptoms, prolonged ambulatory ECG monitoring may provide confirmation of the diagnosis (see "Indications for Intervention" later in this section).

#### *Sick Sinus Syndrome*

Symptomatic arrhythmias in sick sinus syndrome include profound sinus bradycardia, junctional bradycardia, sinus arrest, sinus node exit block, and the so-called tachycardiabradycardia syndrome in which paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, flutter, or fibrillation is followed by symptomatic pauses caused by overdrive suppression of the sinus node and subsidiary pacemakers. In most of these patients, the resting ECG may not be diagnostic, and prolonged ambulatory ECG monitoring is required to document the abnormal rhythm. Electrophysiologic study is of limited help because abnormal sinus node recovery times or sinoatrial conduction times are demonstrable in only a small minority of symptomatic patients.T4

#### *Carotid Sinus Syndrome*

A hyperactive carotid sinus reflex is said to be present when digital stimulation of the carotid sinus results in cardiac asystole lasting 3 or more seconds.T3 Carotid sinus syndrome is diagnosed when, in addition to the presence of a hyperactive reflex, the patient's spontaneous symptom complex can be reproduced by stimulation of one or both

The two types of second-degree heart block are Mobitz I, in which AV conduction time is progressively prolonged (Wenckebach period) until one atrial impulse is not conducted to the ventricle, and Mobitz II, in which AV conduction times are constant, but episodically an atrial impulse is not conducted to the ventricles.

(not simultaneously) carotid sinuses. Pacemaker therapy may completely relieve symptoms in patients with only a cardioinhibitory response. However, the presence of a simultaneous vasodepressor response should also be sought by repetition of massage after intravenous atropine and measurements of the blood pressure. Preservation of the heart rate may not prevent symptoms caused by hypotension in such patients.

#### NATURAL HISTORY

Bradycardia from both spontaneous heart block and spontaneous sinus node dysfunction tends to occur in elderly patients. The mean age of patients at the time of diagnosis of spontaneously occurring heart block is 70 years.A9,S24

#### Spontaneously Developing Complete Heart Block

The proportion of patients with complete heart block developing spontaneously who remain asymptomatic is not known. The most common clinical manifestation is an Adams-Stokes episode. This syndrome is part of the history in 60% to 70% of patients.P8,S24 Symptoms probably eventually develop in most patients. The exact proportion of symptomatic patients is in part determined by functional status of the heart as a whole. Likewise, the tendency toward premature death is related to functional status of the myocardium along with other risk factors.

Patients with Adams-Stokes episodes as a manifestation of complete heart block and who are not paced have a 1-year survival of 50% to 75%, much less than that of an age-sexrace–matched general population.E3,F10,P8 One-year survival is said to be 70% to 80% in patients with complete heart block but without a history of syncope. These differences persist with follow-up to 15 years and appear to be related to the considerably higher prevalence of sudden death in the patients who have syncopal attacks.P8 Syncopal attacks, as well as sudden death, in patients with idioventricular or bundle of His rhythm usually result from sudden ventricular asystole. Syncopal attacks also may be precipitated by a sudden reduction in stroke volume or increased metabolic demands.

#### Congenital Complete Heart Block

Infants born with congenital complete heart block and hearts that are otherwise normal have a prognosis that may be somewhat better than that for patients with spontaneously developing complete heart block.E11,M13,P13 Ten-year survival for congenital complete heart block is about 85%, with most deaths occurring in the first month of life.E11,P13 Deaths occurring after this time are related to Adams-Stokes episodes.

#### Surgically Induced Complete Heart Block

In the early years of cardiac surgery when epicardial and transvenous pacing was not possible, hospital mortality was greatly increased in patients in whom complete heart block developed perioperatively.L12,L13 Unpaced hospital survivors had a 1-year survival of about 40%.

#### Sinus Node Dysfunction

The natural history of patients with this type of bradycardia has not been clearly described.

#### TECHNIQUE OF INTERVENTION

Development of techniques and devices for cardiac pacing has involved surgeons, physicians, interventional cardiologists, and industry, and advances continue to be made. Methods of insertion and the devices implanted are constantly being improved. Whereas in the 1960s pacemakers were usually inserted by cardiothoracic surgeons, currently in many parts of the world they are inserted, managed, and followed by cardiologists, and often by cardiologists with specialized knowledge of cardiac electrophysiology. Because of these developments, it is no longer practical to include detailed descriptions in a textbook of cardiac surgery. Instead, only general information regarding cardiac pacemaking and basic device insertion procedures are discussed.

#### Pacing Modes

There are a number of pacing modes.P3 In addition to the basic characteristics described here, many pacemakers have special tachyarrhythmia functions and other programmable functions. Also, some pacemakers sense some surrogates of increased metabolic activity (e.g., body motion, increased rate or volume of respiration) and increase pacing rate accordingly.

In VVI mode, the ventricle is paced (V), sensing is from the ventricle (V), and response to a sensed spontaneous ventricular depolarization is inhibition (I) of delivering the next electrical stimulus by the pulse generator. The disadvantage of this pacing mode is lack of atrial contributions to ventricular filling. The advantage is simplicity of electrode placement and a relatively long life of the pulse generator.

#### *AAI*

In AAI mode, the atrium (A, usually the right) is paced, sensing is from the atrium (A), and sensed atrial depolarization inhibits (I) the next programmed electrical impulse. The AAI mode requires normal AV conduction and functioning atrial pathways to the AV node. This type of pacing mode was anticipated and pioneered by Lillehei and colleagues as early as 1963.L13

The AAI mode is seldom used (<5%), primarily because many patients with sinus node dysfunction ultimately require ventricular pacing. Its advantage is preservation of atrial contribution to ventricular filling.

#### *VDD*

VDD mode, as well as DVI and DDD modes described subsequently, requires both atrial and ventricular electrodes. It also requires relatively normal sinus node function. In VDD mode, the ventricle is paced (V), both the atrium and ventricle are sensed (*D* denotes dual chamber or dual function), and the response of the pulse generator may be either the triggering or inhibiting (D) of the next electrical pulse. Generally, sensed atrial depolarization triggers a stimulating pulse to the ventricular electrode at a preset or variable PR interval. Ventricular stimulus is inhibited when spontaneous ventricular depolarization follows atrial depolarization within the set PR interval of the pulse generator. The pulse generator is programmed so that when the PP interval becomes excessively long, the pulse generator functions in VVI mode.

Advantages of the VDD mode are preserved atrial contribution to ventricular filling and ventricular rate that follows the patient's own atrial rate, thereby responding appropriately to stress and exercise. Disadvantages are need for both atrial and ventricular electrodes and the possibility of producing a reciprocating (loop) tachycardia by retrograde conduction.

#### *DVI*

Both atrium and ventricle (D) are paced in DVI mode, with an appropriate interval between the stimuli to each. Ventricular (V) but not atrial depolarization is sensed. A sensed ventricular depolarization inhibits (I) the next dual pacing stimulus in noncommitted DVI mode; it does not do so in committed DVI mode.

The advantage is maintaining atrial contribution to ventricular filling even when sinus node function fails. Raza and colleagues, Raichlen and colleagues, and others have documented the hemodynamic advantages of this arrangement.R1,R2 The disadvantage is that AV synchronization is lost when the atrial rate increases during exercise or stress.

#### *DDD*

DDD mode, or universal pacing mode, can pace both atrium and ventricle (D), sense both atrial and ventricular depolarization (D), and either trigger or inhibit (D) an electrical pacing pulse. Its advantage is universality of application. Disadvantages are that dual stimulation reduces battery lifetime, and loop tachycardia can occur with variations in retrograde conduction from ventricles to atria. These disadvantages can be eliminated or reduced by programming the pacemaker pulse generator characteristics according to changes in the patient's AV and ventriculoatrial conduction characteristics.

#### Electrode Testing

Each electrode placed is tested at the time of insertion. The *pacing threshold*, or the lowest delivered voltage at which myocardial depolarization occurs, is tested first. For ventricular electrodes, a threshold of 0.3 V or less (usually at 0.5-ms pulse duration) is optimal. A threshold of 0.3 to 0.5 V is frequently observed, and a threshold as high as 1.0 V is acceptable. Higher thresholds are undesirable because they reduce pulse generator life. For atrial electrodes, a stimulating threshold of 1.0 V or less is acceptable. In open chest insertion, use of the electrocautery tends to increase the stimulating threshold.

The electrode is then tested for its *sensing capabilities*. For both endocardial and epicardial ventricular electrodes, a QRS complex in the electrogram of 5 mV or more is desirable. For atrial electrodes, a P wave with peak-to-peak amplitude of 2 mV or more is acceptable.

Other important testing for a transvenously placed electrode includes determining that (1) it does not provoke ventricular tachycardia by its position, (2) its position is mechanically stable, and (3) it does not pace the diaphragm or skeletal muscle. Bipolar electrodes are generally used; they are less subject to interference by skeletal muscle contraction than unipolar electrodes. The latter are sometimes used when the pulse generator surface serves as the indifferent electrode.

#### Transvenous Electrode Insertion and Pulse Generator Placement

After the patient is positioned on the operating table, temporary pacing wires, if present, are secured with their tips outside the operative field and attached to an external pulse generator. The operative field is prepared and draped, including the lower neck and anterior chest wall. Wires are passed from the surgical field for emergency pacing, obtaining endocardial electrograms, pulse generator testing, and lead threshold measurement. An adjustable constant-current, dual-channel, external pulse generator is used to determine atrial capture when simultaneous atrial and ventricular pacing are necessary.

Local anesthesia is administered to achieve a field block. An oblique or transverse incision is made below the clavicle, generally on the left side (on the right for left-handed individuals). A subcutaneous pocket is created over the pectoralis major fascia. The pocket should be appropriate for size of the pulse generator. If no permanent pacing electrodes are in place, electrocautery may be used for the dissection and to achieve hemostasis.

Edges of the incision are retracted to expose the space between first rib and clavicle for access to the subclavian vein. A needle with a syringe attached is used to locate and penetrate the vein. A flexible J-tip guidewire is passed through the needle into the subclavian vein and advanced into the superior vena cava. Position of the guidewire is confirmed by fluoroscopy, and the needle is withdrawn and replaced with a peel-away sheath catheter. The distal 5 cm of the stylet for the ventricular electrode is bent into a small curve and inserted into the electrode. The electrode and stylet are placed into the sheath catheter and advanced into the right atrium, after which the sheath catheter is peeled away and removed. Under fluoroscopic control, the electrode is advanced through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle and further advanced into the pulmonary trunk to ensure that the coronary sinus has not been entered. The curved stylet is replaced with a straight one that is not fully inserted, leaving the electrode flexible in its distal 5 to 10 cm. The electrode is withdrawn along the ventricular septum until an appropriate anatomic position has been found among the trabeculations near the ventricular apex. The stylet is advanced to the tip of the electrode to stiffen the electrode. It is advanced gently among the trabeculations and "seated." It is secured passively by the tines on the electrode or by extruding its attachment coil. The stylet is removed.

The electrode is then tested (see "Electrode Testing" earlier in this section). Testing with deep breathing is done to judge and set the final length of catheter within the ventricle when the diaphragm is in its most inferior position. Once a suitable anatomic and functional position has been located, the lead is secured with a small plastic sleeve to the pectoral fascia to prevent inadvertent displacement.

Placing the atrial electrode, if one is to be used, is done after inserting the ventricular electrode. Penetrating the subclavian vein for inserting the atrial electrode is preferentially performed at the beginning of the procedure. After the guidewire for the ventricular electrode is inserted, a second guidewire is inserted into the subclavian vein. Separate penetration of the subclavian vein is desirable to prevent dislodging the ventricular electrode while manipulating the atrial electrode. Alternatively, the guidewire used for ventricular electrode insertion may be withdrawn and used subsequently for atrial electrode insertion. Bleeding from the subclavian vein puncture site, however, may be a problem.

A second peel-away sheath catheter is inserted into the subclavian vein over the guidewire and the atrial electrode inserted through it over the guidewire. The electrode is advanced into the right atrium with stylet in place. The stylet is withdrawn, permitting the pre-formed J-curve to appear in the electrode. Manipulation of the stylet and gentle rotation of the electrode permit positioning of its tip into the atrial appendage. This position is verified by the lateral to-and-fro motion of the tip and may be confirmed by lateral fluoroscopy. The electrode tip is secured to atrial endocardium by extruding the screw-in coil. The electrode is then tested (see "Electrode Testing" earlier in this section). After a satisfactory position is achieved, the electrode is secured to the pectoralis fascia by a suture.

The appropriate pulse generator is selected, inspected, and checked by the pacemaker system analyzer. The ends of the pacing leads are cleaned to remove blood or tissue and are inserted into the pulse generator. Satisfactory function of the pacing system is verified by ECG before wound closure. The wound is inspected for hemostasis and irrigated with antibiotic solution. The pacing system is cleaned with antibiotic solution, placed in the pocket, and secured with nonabsorbable sutures. The pacing leads are kept away from the anterior surface of the pulse generator to prevent injury during subsequent pulse generator replacement. The wound is closed in layers, with the first layer isolating the pulse generator pocket from the remainder of the incision.

#### Electrode Insertion by Thoracotomy and Pulse Generator Placement

When an open technique is necessary, the patient is positioned on the operating table for a sternotomy, left anterior thoracotomy, or epigastric incision. For single-chamber (ventricular pacing) insertion, anterior thoracotomy or epigastric incisions are adequate. When dual-chamber pacing is contemplated or when pacing is required early after a cardiac operation, a median sternotomy is used. Procedures regarding temporary pacing wires, skin preparation, and draping are the same as for the transvenous approach.

In adults, a separate transverse left upper quadrant abdominal or infraclavicular incision is made and a pocket developed in the prefascial space. In infants and usually in children, the pocket is created behind the rectus abdominis muscle. A site for electrode attachment to the right or left ventricle is identified in a region of myocardium uncovered by fat, away from any coronary arteries and from the phrenic nerve, and if possible, not directly under the sternum. If there is uncertainty about the site, an electrode probe can be used to locate an appropriate site for placing the electrode. Screw-in electrodes are commonly used for ventricular pacing because of ease of insertion. They are secured by clockwise rotation of the corkscrew electrode with gentle pressure on the myocardium. Electrodes that lie on the epicardial surface, held in place with fine sutures, are preferable for atrial pacing even though they are more difficult to insert. If space permits, two electrodes are placed in each location. The electrodes are tested as previously described.

A tunnel is created from the pericardial cavity to the previously formed subcutaneous pocket. An appropriate pulse generator is selected, tested, and connected to the electrodes.

Wounds are closed in layers, and one chest tube is left for closed drainage.

#### Permanent Pacing after Intracardiac Surgery

Complete heart block occurring during cardiac operation is managed by placing temporary pacing electrodes on the right ventricle and right atrium so that AV sequential pacing can be performed using an external pulse generator. The pacing threshold of the temporary electrodes should be tested daily. When it appears that complete heart block or profound bradycardia is likely to be permanent, an implantable pacing system is inserted by the transvenous or open route.

The notable exception to this strategy is when there is a high probability of complete heart block developing at operation or when heart block may develop later and access to the right ventricle by the transvenous route is not possible. This includes patients who have replacement of the tricuspid valve with a mechanical prosthesis. These patients should have permanent epicardial electrodes placed at the time of the cardiac operation. Bioprosthetic valves in the tricuspid position may be crossed by a transvenous electrode without important impairment of prosthetic valve function.E6

Before discontinuing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), cardiac action is established by AV sequential pacing through two temporary right atrial and two temporary ventricular wires attached to an external pulse generator. Single bipolar temporary wires may also be used. Preferably, permanent ventricular electrodes are placed after discontinuing CPB and completing hemostasis, because electrocautery tends to increase the pacing threshold of already implanted leads. Permanent atrial electrodes should also be placed if dual chamber pacing is desired. The ends of the permanent leads are capped and placed subcutaneously in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen or brought through the anterior chest wall to a subcutaneous position below the left clavicle. A loop of lead is left within the pericardial cavity.

If heart block persists, the patient is returned to the operating room. With the patient under local anesthesia and conscious sedation, the surgical field is prepared. A transverse incision is made over the left upper quadrant of the abdomen (or below the clavicle), and the electrode ends are retrieved. The electrodes are tested and attached to the pulse generator, a pocket is created for it, and the incision is closed. The temporary wires are withdrawn.

Alternatively, the pulse generator can be attached to the electrodes and implanted at the time of cardiac repair. The disadvantage is that sinus rhythm may return in a few days, and the pulse generator may no longer be essential. There is also risk of bleeding into the pulse generator pocket, with formation of a hematoma.

#### SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Usual care for cardiac surgical patients is given early postoperatively (see Chapter 5). In addition, a chest radiograph is obtained to ascertain position of the leads. Pacing threshold is usually not determined by noninvasive testing prior to hospital discharge, because thresholds obtained at this time are always higher than those obtained 6 weeks to 3 months

later. Reprogramming of the pulse generator at an appropriate voltage is best done later, leaving the relatively higher and safer pacing voltage until that time.

The electrodes are considered to have become stable by about 6 months after implantation. F13 Around that time they are rechecked, and the pulse generator is set at the lowest output considered to be safe.

#### **RESULTS**

#### Survival

It is generally agreed that survival of patients with bradycardia is improved by permanent pacing. Death early after pacemaker insertion is unusual, and when it occurs it is usually due to coexisting cardiac problems. Ten-day mortality is 1.6%, and 30-day mortality is 2.7% (Fig. 16-1).

Survival late after pacemaker insertion is satisfactory, with 5- and 10-year survival of 59% and 39%, respectively<sup>F12,H11</sup> (see Fig. 16-1). Survival is similar in those whose bradycardia is from heart block and those in whom it is related to sinus node dysfunction. H11,S24 Advanced age decreases late survival (Table 16-1), as does chronic heart failure and presence of ischemic heart disease. A9,A10,H11,O12,S24

**Figure 16-2** Variation in pacing threshold after development of complete heart block following repair of "single" ventricle. Note episodic and unpredictable sudden increases in threshold, which could have led to sudden death if output from the pulse generator had been insufficient to overcome them. (From Shepard and colleagues. S20)

#### Infection and Pulse Generator Erosion

Infection and pulse generator erosion are not always identified separately as complications of pacemaking, and they must therefore be considered together.

Even with meticulous surgical technique and prophylactic antibiotic therapy, infection in the wound and around the pulse generator and leads occurs in 0.5% to 2% of cases. H11,S21 Treatment consists of inserting an entirely new pacemaker system at a different site and complete removal of the old system. B3

Excessive pressure of the pulse generator or wire against the overlying skin or subcutaneous tissue can cause necrosis and permit their exposure. S21 The true prevalence of this condition is unknown because it is often considered infection. Insertion of pulse generators in small pockets with skin closure under tension increases the chance of skin necrosis. When the pulse generator and leads become exposed as a result of pressure necrosis, treatment is the same as for an infected pacemaker. Preventing this problem is best achieved by forming the pulse generator pocket in the immediate prefascial space to permit as much tissue as possible to come between pulse generator and skin.

#### Lead and Electrode Malfunction

#### Time-Related Variability of Pacing Thresholds

The lowest possible initial pacing and sensing thresholds are sought at the time of placing the electrodes, because thresholds frequently rise later. F10 One or more months after insertion, more than half the leads have a threshold pacing level greater than any level measured initially or during the first month of use. F20 Forty-five percent of epicardial electrode leads have either a grossly unstable threshold pacing level or a gradually increasing level (Fig. 16-2) for as long as 10 years after insertion (Fig. 16-3). These "spikes" in the threshold pacing level may be associated with episodes of intercurrent infection. Such changes probably account for at least some of the sudden deaths that occur late after initiating pacing for complete heart block after repair of congenital heart disease.

**Figure 16-3** Unpredicted rapid increase in pacing threshold about 7 years after implanting pulse generator a few days after development of complete heart block during intracardiac repair. Patient had congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries. (From Shepard and colleagues. S20)

#### Undersensing

Undersensing, or lack of recognization of the heart's depolarization, is related most commonly to inadequate placement of the electrode. At times it can result from fibrosis at the electrode-myocardial junction. This complication leads to competitive pacing. Undersensing can generally be treated by noninvasive programming to increase sensitivity of the pulse generator.

#### Electrode Dislodgment

Electrode dislodgment, with or without right ventricular or atrial perforation, is the most common complication of inserting either ventricular or atrial endocardial leads. Dislodgment occurs in less than 2% of cases. F10,V4

#### Lead Fracture

Lead fracture, with consequent loss of pacing, is an infrequent early complication of pacemaking but is not uncommon years after implantation.

#### New Symptoms from Pacing in VVI Mode

Syncope or near-syncope is one of the most important symptoms resulting from pacing. Syncope as a manifestation of pacemaker syndrome occurs in less than 10% of patients being paced in VVI mode. Arterial hypotension may also develop. These symptoms usually occur when ventriculoatrial conduction is intact and the indication for pacing has been sinus node dysfunction. No The exact etiology of symptoms is uncertain, but they may be due to lack of atrial contribution to ventricular filling secondary to AV asynchrony, with or without atrial contraction against a closed AV valve. Also, AV valve regurgitation may be caused by asynchronous contraction of atria and ventricles. M10 Diagnosis is suspected when those symptoms and signs are present and can sometimes be verified by an increase in blood pressure when pacing is stopped and a decrease when it is restarted. Treatment is VDD or DDD pacing.

Dizziness occurs in about one third of patients. Because both dizziness and syncope are common in elderly patients, these symptoms may not be the result of pacing per se. Palpitations are noted by about one third of patients, sometimes due to awareness of ventricular pacing. They are noted frequently at night when sinus slowing in patients with VVI units results in pacemaker activation. They may be eliminated by AAI or DDD pacing or minimized by programming hysteresis into a VVI system.

#### INDICATIONS FOR INTERVENTION

The most common indication for permanent cardiac pacing is symptomatic bradycardia. P12 It may be intermittent or permanent and due to complete heart block, second-degree AV block, or sinus node dysfunction. Symptoms must be directly attributable to the bradycardia and may include syncope, dizziness, exercise intolerance, and heart failure. When ambulatory ECG monitoring is negative for abnormal bradycardia, electrophysiologic study is indicated in patients with unexplained transient neurologic symptoms. The finding of prolongation of the HV interval (time from onset of activation of the bundle of His to the earliest onset of ventricular depolarization) of at least 70 milliseconds supports a diagnosis of paroxysmal AV block as the cause of the symptoms and justifies elective pacemaker implantation. 89 In the absence of neurologic symptoms, however, the finding of such HV prolongation rarely if ever warrants prophylactic pacemaker implantation.D8

Another indication is surgically induced complete heart block, because of the risk of an Adams-Stokes episode. Patients in sinus rhythm after repair of congenital malformations, but in whom complete heart block follows repair and persists for a number of days before reversion to sinus rhythm, are at increased risk for developing late symptomatic heart block. These patients should be considered for prophylactic pacemaker implantation before hospital discharge, particularly when subsidiary escape pacemakers have been absent or unreliable.

In some situations, permanent pacing may be indicated in asymptomatic patients because of risk of an Adams-Stokes episode. F11 These situations include profound bradycardia (ventricular rate  $< 40 \text{ beats} \cdot \text{min}^{-1}$ ), second-degree AV block at the infra-His level, advanced second-degree AV or complete heart block after myocardial infarction, and congenital heart block with a wide QRS escape rhythm. Other rhythms may be an indication for pacing in asymptomatic patients. These include new bundle-branch block with transient second-degree AV block postmyocardial infarction, bifascicular bundle-branch block with intermittent type II seconddegree AV block, sinus node dysfunction, and transient postsurgical AV block that reverts to bifascicular block in children. F11,H16 In sinus node dysfunction, for example, when symptoms are relatively infrequent, the decision to advise permanent pacing may rest on the demonstration of asymptomatic sinus pauses, sinoatrial exit block, or both.

A special situation is extensive intraatrial operations such as the Senning or Mustard operation (see "Senning Technique" and "Mustard Technique" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 52) or the Fontan operation (see Chapter 41). Junctional rhythm often develops late postoperatively with the potential of tachybradycardia and sudden death. This situation is an indication for atrial pacing (AAI). M10

#### HISTORICAL NOTE

Surgical procedures that successfully controlled many abnormal tachycardias resistant to drug treatment were developed during the 1970s and 1980s. Electrophysiologic studies accomplished by cardiac catheterization were necessary for precise diagnosis of many abnormal tachycardias, and cardiac electrophysiology rapidly became a field of special interest and competence among a small group of cardiologists. With the advent of interventional cardiology, methods for highly selective catheter ablation of areas identified by electrophysiologic studies have become successful and are replacing more invasive and somewhat cumbersome techniques of intraoperative mapping and cryoablation.

#### TACHYCARDIA FROM ATRIOVENTRICULAR NODAL REENTRY

Atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardia is the most common cause of paroxysmal tachycardia. One of its characteristics is the electrophysiologic phenomenon of dual AV nodal pathways. The fast pathway (with a normal AV conduction rate) is believed to be located within or near the AV node, and the slow one adjacent to and usually inferior to the node, lying closer to the coronary sinus.

A successful surgical approach to this problem, using cryosurgical ablation, was developed and used by Sealy, Cox, Holman, and colleagues.C25,H20,H21,S13 Results of this type of surgical therapy have been good, with no deaths among 23 patients (CL 0%-8%) who underwent surgical correction without the production of heart block.C23 Currently, however, catheter ablation techniques are used for this purpose, and they are directed at selective ablation of the slow or fast pathway, usually the slow one, to eliminate the reentry circuit (and thus the tachycardia) while avoiding the need for implanting a permanent pacemaker.G6,S8 This can be successful in up to 90% of patients.E10,H5,K4 Occasionally, open cryosurgical ablation is performed in symptomatic patients who require open cardiac surgery for other indications.

## ECTOPIC ATRIAL TACHYCARDIA

Ectopic foci of activation in either right or left atrium can provoke paroxysms of atrial tachycardia. When localized by electrophysiologic studies, they can be treated successfully by catheter ablation. However, most ectopic atrial tachycardias, particularly those originating in the right atrium, have multiple sites of origin and are best treated pharmacologically.D2

#### INDICATIONS FOR INTERVENTION

Development of modern devices for cardiac pacemaking and for implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) has made sophisticated understanding of cardiac electrophysiology and electrical engineering necessary for proper care of patients with these conditions. Currently these requirements are met by few cardiac surgeons. Furthermore, most interventional therapies for these abnormal atrial tachycardias can now be performed using percutaneous techniques.

# **Section III Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome**

### DEFINITION

Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome as originally described is a condition in which episodes of rapid heart rate (paroxysmal tachycardia) occur in otherwise healthy young people in combination with an ECG demonstrating delta waves and a broad QRS complex (bundle branch block with short PR interval)*.* W18 WPW is one of the *preexcitation syndromes*, a term that implies activation of a cardiac chamber partially or wholly by an impulse arising in another chamber and arriving earlier than would be expected if the impulse had proceeded over the normal conduction system pathway.

WPW syndrome characteristically allows paroxysmal atrial tachycardia (PAT) by *atrioventricular reentry*. In some patients, however, the accessory pathways conduct only in a retrograde manner *(concealed AV accessory pathways)* and do not produce the typical WPW ECG.

## HISTORICAL NOTE

Although Cohn and Fraser in 1913 and Wilson in 1915 described what apparently was WPW, and Mines in 1914 described "circulating excitations" in the turtle heart, the specific ECG pattern of WPW syndrome was not reported until 1930 by Wolff, Parkinson, and White.C10,M16,W12,W18 In 1967, Durrer and RoosD13 demonstrated by epicardial mapping that in patients with WPW, atrioventricular (AV) conduction occurs over an accessory AV conduction pathway, or bypass tract, a concept first proposed in 1932 by Holtzmann and Scherf.H23 This was confirmed in the same year by Burchell and colleagues, who also showed that ventricular preexcitation could be temporarily abolished by injecting procaine into the AV groove at the site of earliest ventricular activation.B16

In 1893, Kent described muscular bridges connecting right atrium to right ventricle in several mammalian species, and Wood and colleagues supported those observations in 1943.K6,W19 Truex and colleagues in 1958 and 1960 demonstrated the presence of muscular accessory pathways in human hearts, and Lev and colleagues added further information on accessory pathway morphology in the early 1960s.L4,L5,T6,T7 Further proof of the morphologic basis of WPW syndrome came in 1968, when Cobb, Sealy, and colleagues reported dividing the accessory pathway; PR interval and QRS complex became normal, the delta wave disappeared, and ventricular preexcitation and recurrent supraventricular tachycardia were eliminated.C8 In that operation, an epicardial approach was used and a transmural ventricular incision made below the AV groove. Iwa and colleagues published a confirmatory report in 1970 and introduced the endocardial approach.I2 Sealy and colleagues then also adopted an endocardial approach from within the atria, which consisted of separating atrium from anulus after dissecting away the AV fat pad.S17 Sealy, Gallagher, and their colleagues also pioneered a successful surgical approach for patients whose accessory pathways were in the septal area and introduced cryosurgical ablation.G4,S11 This method was combined with the epicardial approach using CPB by Guiraudon and colleagues.G23,G25,K12

These surgical developments provided much of the information that made catheter ablation of the accessory pathways possible beginning in the early 1980s.G17,H9,S8 Early experiences in patients used direct current (DC) as the energy source, but limitations were imposed by this method. Catheter ablation became reproducible and safe when radiofrequency (RF) energy was introduced.J1,R8,S7 Different effects can be achieved by varying the RF output mode, frequency, waveform, and power output. Currently, catheter ablation techniques have replaced surgical techniques for interventional therapy of supraventricular tachycardia of all types and at all ages, except for occasional patients being operated on for other cardiac conditions.

#### MORPHOLOGY

Accessory AV conduction pathways (Kent bundles) mediating WPW syndrome may occur at any point around the anulus of either AV valve, except along the junction of the mitral anulus and aortic valve.B2 However, they are most commonly located:

- Along the strong, well-formed mitral anulus, adjacent to the free wall of the left ventricle laterally or posteriorly (WPW type A)
- At the less well-developed tricuspid valve anulus anterosuperiorly, adjacent to the right ventricular free wall (WPW type B)
- Along the tricuspid anulus, adjacent to the anterior aspect of the ventricular septum
- Along the tricuspid or mitral anulus, adjacent to the posterior aspect of the ventricular septum, near the crux cordis

Accessory pathways adjacent to the posterior aspect of the ventricular septum lie in the potential space overlying the inlet portion of the septum and may be on either its right or left ventricular aspects.S11

Kent bundles are said to have an average width of 1.8 mm.S14 Multiple functioning bundles are present in 10% to 20% of cases.I3,S12,U2

From the standpoint of cardiac surgeons and interventional cardiologists, location of accessory AV pathways is important, as are the normal location of the AV node and bundle of His (see "Conduction System" in Chapter 1) and details of the structures and spaces around the AV valve anuli and fibrous skeleton of the heart. The *central fibrous body*, where mitral, tricuspid, and aortic valves meet, is the most prominent part of the fibrous skeleton. The area of fibrous continuity between aortic and mitral valves, the *aortic-mitral anulus*, contributes to the fibrous skeleton. The leftward extension of this anulus is the *left fibrous trigone*. The *right fibrous trigone* is at the right-sided extremity of the mitral-aortic anulus and is part of the central fibrous body. It lies adjacent to the AV portion of the membranous septum at the point where tricuspid, mitral, and aortic anuli come together. Atrial muscle is not in juxtaposition with ventricular muscle in the area between left and right fibrous trigones (along the aortic-mitral anulus), and thus accessory AV connections are not found in this area. As the surgeon views the mitral valve through the opened left atrium, the right fibrous trigone is just anterior to the medial commissure, and the left fibrous trigone is just lateral to the lateral commissure. As the surgeon views the tricuspid valve, the central fibrous body is in the region of the muscular portion of the AV septum (see "Cardiac Valves" in Chapter 1).

Normal anatomy in the region of the crux cordis and contiguous posterior septal area is of critical importance in therapy to ablate accessory AV conduction pathways in the region of the posterior aspect of the ventricular septum. This anatomy was described by Sealy and Gallagher as a "toppled pyramid enclosing a fat-filled space."S11 The apex of the pyramid is the right fibrous trigone, and its base is the

![](_page_12_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 16-4** Schematic representation of normal anatomy in region of the crux cordis. Distance from crux cordis to right fibrous trigone is 30 mm, which is essentially alongside the atrioventricular portion of the membranous septum *(AMS)*, which lies just on the atrial side of the tricuspid valve anulus. Distance from the most posterior aspect of the mitral valve to right fibrous trigone is 28 mm, and that from the most posterior aspect of tricuspid valve to the trigone is 35 mm. The latter is the area of Sealy's "toppled pyramid." Note the aorta *(Ao)* is wedged into position between mitral *(MV)* and tricuspid valves *(TV)*. (From Sealy and Mikat.S16)

epicardium over the crux. In adults, a distance of about 30 mm separates base from apex (Fig. 16-4).S11 The two sides of the pyramid are right and left atria, which fuse in the region of the right fibrous trigone to become the atrial septum. It is important to note that the mitral valve anulus lies a somewhat variable distance superior to the tricuspid anulus, which accounts for there being an AV septum (see "Atrioventricular Septum" under Ventricular Septum in Chapter 1). Also, the interatrial groove, marking the posterior aspect of the atrial septum, lies somewhat to the left of the posterior aspect of the interventricular groove, and here the right atrium somewhat overlies or wraps around the interatrial groove. The third side of the pyramid is the wall of the posterior superior process of the left ventricle and the muscular ventricular septum posteriorly. This pyramidal space contains fat, branches of the coronary artery, and the undersurface of the coronary sinus with its branches from right and left ventricles.

The heart is usually otherwise normal in patients with WPW syndrome. However, in some, accessory muscle bundles coexist with Ebstein anomaly, fossa ovalis–type atrial septal defect, AV discordant connection, and other anomalies.S14

#### CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

#### Pathophysiology

Electrical impulses originate in the sinoatrial (SA) node and travel to the AV node through preferential pathways (see "Conduction System" in Chapter 1). Normally, fibrous anuli of mitral and tricuspid valves prevent direct transmission of electrical impulses from atrium to ventricle (fibrous tissue, in contrast to muscle and specialized cells, does not conduct), and conduction occurs only via the AV node and bundle of His. At the AV node, a delay in AV conduction normally occurs before the impulse passes to the bundle of His and ultimately to the Purkinje cells. This delay is reflected in the normal His bundle electrogram, in which an atrial

Arrows indicate direction of impulse. Key: *A,* Atrial electrogram; *d,* delta wave; *H,* His bundle electrogram; *V,* ventricular electrogram. (From Gallagher and colleagues.G5)

electrogram is recorded at the time of the P wave in the standard ECG, a His bundle electrogram 60 to 100 milliseconds later, and ventricular electrical activity at the onset of the QRS complex (Fig. 16-5, *A*).

In WPW syndrome, with the Kent bundle offering an AV bypass tract, the electrical impulse travels antegradely down the normal pathway but also antegrade down the Kent bundle, where delay normally imposed by the AV node is absent. This results in ventricular preexcitation at the insertion of the Kent bundle and short PR interval, delta wave, and wide QRS complex characteristic of WPW syndrome (Fig. 16-5, *B*).

The normal AV conduction pathway and the accessory pathway constitute the basis for the reciprocating tachycardia (circus movement) sometimes seen in patients with WPW syndrome. Most commonly, the circus movement uses the normal AV conduction system as the antegrade limb and bypass tract as the retrograde limb of the reentrant circuit (*orthodromic* circus movement tachycardia). Less commonly, the accessory pathway is used in an antegrade manner, and the normal AV conduction system in a retrograde manner (*antidromic* circus movement tachycardia).K20

When atrial fibrillation develops, rapid conduction via the accessory pathway may result in life-threatening ventricular responses, sometimes degenerating into ventricular fibrillation.

#### Symptoms

Patients usually present because of palpitations, with or without symptoms of acute cardiac failure. Palpitations and documented episodic tachycardias have often been present for 10 to 15 years and repeated hospitalizations may have been required.H22 More than half of patients with paroxysmal tachycardia and WPW syndrome give a history of syncope or near-syncope.H22 Rarely, they present after resuscitation from an episode of sudden death.

#### Signs

Diagnosis is made from the characteristic ECG (see Fig. 16-5). Atrial fibrillation or flutter may coexist. Preexcitation and presence of accessory AV conduction pathways are confirmed by electrophysiologic testing in a specially equipped cardiac electrophysiology laboratory.

### NATURAL HISTORY

Electrocardiographic diagnosis of preexcitation WPW syndrome is made in about 0.25% of healthy young people, with documented tachyarrhythmias occurring in about 2% of those with preexcitation.D4 However, in other patient subsets of WPW, prevalence of tachyarrhythmias is as high as 80%. Half the infants and children with supraventricular tachycardia difficult to control medically have WPW or concealed accessory muscle bundlesG9 (see Section IV later in this chapter).

Patients with WPW may present at any age, including the early months of life. The syndrome is more common in males.D7,W17 Most adults with WPW have otherwise normal hearts, although it may complicate a variety of acquired and congenital cardiac defects, including Ebstein anomaly.B6,N4,S26 Patients with Ebstein anomaly often have multiple right-sided accessory pathways, and preexcitation is said to be limited to the atrialized portion of the ventricle.S15,S26 Rossi and Thiene have shown in patients having arrhythmogenic death that a few of them have accessory conduction pathways combined with very mild downward displacement of the tricuspid septal leaflet.R5

Among patients with WPW and tachyarrhythmias, 80% have paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias of a reciprocating type, 15% have atrial fibrillation, and 5% have atrial flutter. Sinus node dysfunction is said to be more common in patients with WPW than in those without it.H15

Patients with WPW, otherwise normal hearts, and no tachycardia have normal cardiac function and life expectancy. Morbidity is considerable in those with recurrent tachycardia, and sudden death occurs in a small proportion. These sudden deaths are most likely the result of combined paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and fast antegrade conduction across the accessory AV pathways.D11,K11 Some children and young adults with WPW and recurrent tachycardia lose the tendency toward developing tachyarrhythmias as they grow older. Also, preexcitation may be intermittent with loss of the delta wave, a situation suggesting a benign prognosis.K13

#### TECHNIQUE OF INTERVENTION

The object of catheter ablation (or operation) is electrical isolation of the ventricles from the atria except for the normal AV nodal pathway. Patients are brought to a cardiac electrophysiology laboratory. The study is performed under sedation with fentanyl and midazolam and accessory pathways are localized. An electrode catheter is appropriately positioned and RF current delivered.J1 Repeat ablations at subsequent procedures are required in a few patients.

#### RESULTS

Surgical procedures for termination of WPW syndrome were successful in 80% to 90% of patients.B15,G10,H22,I1,O11 Interruption of the accessory pathways prevents both reentrant AV arrhythmias and those due to atrial tachycardia, flutter, or fibrillation associated with rapid antegrade conduction across the accessory pathways.

RF catheter ablation is highly successful.J1,S7 Accessory pathway conduction was eliminated in 164 (99%) of 166 patients in one study, without mortality.J1 Preexcitation or AV reentrant tachycardia recurred in only 15 (9%; CL 7%-12%), all of whom underwent a second successful catheter ablation.J1

#### INDICATIONS FOR INTERVENTION

Symptomatic tachyarrhythmias associated with one or more accessory AV pathways are an indication for catheter ablation.

When cardiac operation is indicated in an asymptomatic patient with WPW, accessory pathways should probably be interrupted by catheter ablation techniques before operation, because serious postoperative tachycardias and life-threatening atrial fibrillation can result from their presence. When catheter ablation is not available, a surgical procedure is indicated for interruption of the accessory pathways by either the endocardial or epicardial approach.C24,G11,G24,G25,I4,L15 The welltested endocardial approach was described in the first edition of this text and has been clearly illustrated by others.D9,K9

# **Section IV Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter**

## DEFINITION

*Atrial fibrillation* is a disorder of cardiac rhythm characterized by rapid (350-500/min), irregular disorganized atrial impulses and ineffective atrial contractions.R3 P waves are absent from the ECG, and the bipolar electrogram reveals beat-to-beat polarity, morphology, amplitude, and cycle length that vary. The QRS complex is irregularly irregular. *Atrial flutter* is a disorder of cardiac rhythm characterized by rapid (250-350/min) regular atrial impulses. QRS complexes are uniform in morphology, and P waves may have sawtoothed configuration.

#### HISTORICAL NOTE

The first clear description of atrial fibrillation is attributed to Herring in 1903 (pulsus irregularis perpetuus), although this was before the era of electrocardiography.H13 Withering, in his studies on digitalis, was probably also aware of atrial fibrillation, because he noted that digitalis was a "moderator and regulator of rhythm."W14 The beneficial effect of digitalis in atrial fibrillation was clearly noted in 1836 by Bouillaud in his classic textbook,B13 quoted by Meijler.M11 By 1914, MackenzieM1 and Sir Thomas LewisL8 had framed the controversy on the mechanism of action of digitalis, presaging continuing discussions as to the etiology of atrial fibrillation and electrophysiologic state of the atria during atrial fibrillation.

Pharmacologic interventions, notably digitalis (to slow the rate) and quinidine (to convert the rhythm), were the mainstays of treatment. There are obvious advantages of sinus rhythm, and in 1962, Lown and colleaguesL16 and in 1963, Oram and colleaguesO6 published their landmark studies of electrical cardioversion as treatment for atrial fibrillation. Perhaps only 15% of patients with persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation respond to these interventions. Therefore, there has been a continuing interest in finding an interventional solution to the problem of atrial fibrillation.

Catheter-induced His bundle ablation introduced by Scheinman and colleaguesS8 and Gallager and colleaguesG6 in 1982 controlled the tachycardia of established atrial fibrillation but required implanting a pacemaker. In 1990, Guiraudon and colleagues reported seven of nine patients free of atrial fibrillation after an operation designed to isolate a corridor of atrial tissue connecting the sinus and AV nodes.G26 Creating a maze by multiple atrial incisions was developed by Cox and colleagues in 1991.C17,C22,C27,C29

Cox and colleagues have reviewed the development of the maze procedure and its preceding operations.C28 The *left atrial isolation* procedure was described in 1980.W10 This operation confined atrial fibrillation to the left atrium and obviated the need for a permanent pacemaker while restoring cardiac hemodynamics. Vulnerability to systemic thromboembolism remained unchanged. In 1982, Scheinman and colleagues, as noted previously, described *catheter ablation of the His bundle* with insertion of a permanent pacemaker to restore regular rhythm as a means of controlling ventricular rate.S8 Risk of thromboembolism was unaffected. Guiraudon and colleagues described the *corridor procedure* in 1985.G22 This procedure isolated a strip of atrial septum (the "corridor") containing both the sinoatrial node and the AV node so that the sinoatrial node could once again pace the ventricles, even though the atria continued to fibrillate. AV synchrony was not restored, and risk of thromboembolism persisted. Understanding the electrophysiology of atrial fibrillation based on work of Boineau and colleagues and Alessie and colleagues led to development of the *atrial transection* procedure.A7,B11,B12,C29 Initial success in a patient was followed by recurrence of atrial fibrillation. Further advances in the understanding of atrial fibrillation using more sophisticated means of atrial mapping led to the concept that interruption of the multiple macro-reentrant circuits responsible for the arrhythmia would be possible.D1 The surgical procedure was based on the concept of a maze and was named the *maze procedure*. C17,C29

As cited by Cox and colleaguesC27 following dialogues between Mackenzie and Lewis, there evolved three theories regarding the electrophysiologic mechanism of atrial fibrillation. Rothberger believed there was a single automatic atrial focus, the inference being that its resection or isolation might cure atrial fibrillation.R6 Engleman suggested the presence of multiple small automatic foci.E8 Garrey experimentally disproved both hypotheses by isolating smaller and smaller segments of fibrillating atrial tissue.G7 His observations suggested that (1) some critical atrial mass was necessary to sustain atrial fibrillation and (2) the underlying mechanism was reentry, not automaticity. Based on experiments using programmed electrical stimulation, Moe hypothesized the existence of multiple wavelets with different refractory periods within the atrial mass.M19 Inhomogeneous tissue refractoriness lends itself to reentry, not automatic mechanisms. Moe's theories were later confirmed by Allessie's group using multiplexed computerized recordings in rabbit atria.A5 Boineau and colleagues mapped circus motion around the superior vena cava orifice in a dog with naturally occurring atrial flutter.B12 They concluded that in addition to functional factors (nonuniform repolarization), anatomic factors also contribute to atrial dysrhythmias. Cox and colleagues then created atrial fibrillation in experimental animals and mapped the electrophysiologic events.C22 In their 1991 publication they concluded, "The presence of macro-reentrant circuits and the absence of either micro-reentrant circuits or evidence of atrial automaticity suggests that atrial fibrillation should be amenable to surgical ablation." They subsequently demonstrated the ability to terminate atrial fibrillation in humans by performing the classic maze procedure.C29 In 1994, Haissaguerre and colleagues reported successful ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation using a catheter-based technique.H2 Since the publication of these two landmark studies, many modifications of the initial ablation techniques to terminate atrial fibrillation have been introduced.

#### PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

Theories of the mechanism of atrial fibrillation involve two processesF15: (1) focal triggers of enhanced automaticityH4 and (2) multiple wavelets of macro-reentry activation migrating across the atria.M19 Rapidly firing foci, located mostly in pulmonary veins and also but less frequently in the right atrium, superior vena cava, or coronary sinus, can initiate atrial fibrillation in susceptible patients. Fractionation of multiple wave fronts as they spread across the atria results in self-perpetuating "daughter wavelets" that cause complete absence of coordinated atrial systole. The reentry circuits follow different pathways each time after initiation and have been thought in the past to be random.

Recent evidence suggests that there may be more organization than previously thought. Three patterns of atrial fibrillation have been identified by Allessi and colleaguesA6:

- Single wave fronts
- One or two wave fronts
- Multiple activation wave fronts propagating in different directions across the atria

Focal triggers as the only mechanism of atrial fibrillation probably apply to patients with normal atria; triggers plus macroreentry (substrate) mechanisms apply to enlarged or diseased atria.

Risk factors for developing atrial fibrillation include inflammation, oxidative stress, and atrial morphology.P4 In addition, genetic susceptibility factors related to several ion channels have been implicated in its pathogenesis.K17,L18,O1 Missense mutations of the gap junction protein connexin-40 (encoded by the GJA5 gene), which plays a critical role in electrical intercellular coupling, has been implicated in a small number of cases of atrial fibrillation.Y1 Lu and colleagues have found that microRNA-328 contributes to adverse atrial electrical remodeling in atrial fibrillation by targeting L-type calcium channel genes.L17

#### CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

#### Classification

Classification of atrial fibrillation begins with the first detected episode.F15 If two or more episodes occur, atrial fibrillation is considered *recurrent*. Recurrent atrial fibrillation is designated as paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent as described in Box 16-5. These categories are not mutually exclusive. An individual patient may have several episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and occasional persistent atrial fibrillation or

#### **Box 16-5** Clinical Classification of Atrial Fibrillation

The joint American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology task force has recommended the following nomenclature for classifying atrial fibrillation.F15,F16 Classification begins with the first detected episode of atrial fibrillation. If a patient has two or more episodes, atrial fibrillation is considered *recurrent*. Recurrent atrial fibrillation is designated as paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent.

#### **Paroxysmal***a*

Atrial fibrillation lasting 7 or fewer (most <24 hours) days and terminating spontaneously

#### **Persistent***a*

Atrial fibrillation lasting more than 7 days that does not terminate spontaneously, but requires electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion to restore normal sinus rhythm; if the first detected episode of atrial fibrillation does not terminate spontaneously, it is also designated persistent

#### **Permanent**

Atrial fibrillation in which sinus rhythm cannot be sustained after cardioversion or the patient and physician have decided against further efforts to restore sinus rhythm

Both paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation may be recurrent.

the reverse.F16 It is practical to categorize a given patient by the most frequent presentation. The definition of permanent atrial fibrillation is often arbitrary.F16 This terminology applies to episodes lasting more than 30 seconds without a reversible cause.

Secondary atrial fibrillation in the setting of acute myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery, pericarditis, myocarditis, hyperthyroidism, or acute pulmonary disease is considered separately, and treatment of the underlying disorder usually terminates the arrhythmia.F16 The term *lone atrial fibrillation* refers to individuals younger than 60 years of age without clinical or echocardiographic evidence of cardiopulmonary disease, including hypertension. The term *nonvalvar atrial fibrillation* refers to patients without rheumatic mitral valve disease, prosthetic heart valve replacement, or valve repair.F16

#### Diagnosis, Symptoms, and Signs

Shortness of breath is a common presenting symptom. Cardiac conditions associated with atrial fibrillation include hypertension, ischemic or valvar heart disease, cardiomyopathy, cardiac tumors, and pericarditis, and presenting symptoms and signs are often those associated with these conditions. Noncardiac conditions associated with atrial fibrillation are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, thyroid disease, electrolyte imbalance, and alcohol abuse. Vagally mediated atrial fibrillation resulting from high vagal tone occurring after meals or exercise and during sleep or rest can be exacerbated with digitalis. The ECG shows very short atrial intervals at a rate faster than the ventricular rate. An irregular ventricular rate is usually present.L6,N2 Spontaneous conversion of atrial fibrillation is common, with up to 70% of patients with first-time atrial fibrillation reverting to normal sinus rhythm. Frequency of spontaneous conversion decreases with each subsequent episode.J5

#### NATURAL HISTORY

Atrial fibrillation is not a benign arrhythmia and presents a difficult clinical challenge. It is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, accounting for about one third of arrhythmia diagnoses. It is estimated that 2.2 million people in the United States and more than 5 million people worldwide have atrial fibrillation.F1,O3 It is present in approximately 1% of the general population and 6% of those older than age 65 years.C28 There are about 360,000 new patients diagnosed annually in the United States.B8 According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, atrial fibrillation resulted annually (up until 1990) in 227,000 hospitalizations (50% as emergencies) at a cost of \$6.6 billion.C28

Atrial fibrillation is associated with thromboembolism, including stroke or pulmonary embolism, and results from slow and stagnant blood flow in the atria. Risk of stroke associated with atrial fibrillation is 5% to 12% per year.N2,W15 Prospective studies on the treatment of atrial fibrillation place the risk of stroke at 5% to 8% in patients receiving placebo treatment.C13,P10,S31 Risk of stroke may be reduced by 37% to 86% by anticoagulation with warfarin, but at a cost of bleeding risk in 0.5% to 2.8% of patients per year.A13,F3,G1 Factors that increase the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation include older age, diabetes, heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, and previous embolism. Chronic atrial fibrillation is associated with cellular changes that progress to atrial myocardial fibrosis. The progressive nature of the condition leads to enlargement of the atria and eventual loss of function of the atrial myocardium. Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy is an end-stage complication of atrial fibrillation.

## TECHNIQUE OF INTERVENTION

Two treatment approaches are used to manage patients with atrial fibrillation: (1) control of ventricular rate and anticoagulation and (2) restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm.

#### Ventricular Rate Control

Ventricular rate control can be accomplished with a variety of drugs, including digoxin, β-blockers, and calcium channel blockers. Adequacy of ventricular rate control is usually assessed with the patient at rest. However, assessment of ventricular rate should also be done during exercise, because activity may result in an excessively high ventricular rate. Persistently elevated ventricular rate may induce tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy. Risk of thromboembolism increases 48 hours after the onset of atrial fibrillation. If sinus rhythm is not restored during this time, anticoagulant therapy should be initiated.L6,N2,O3 Large random trials evaluating oral anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation and subjected to meta-analysis demonstrated a 61% reduction in stroke compared with placebo.F15 Risk stratification models have been introduced to identify patients with atrial fibrillation who benefit from oral anticoagulation. The ACC/ AHA/European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for managing patients with atrial fibrillation have developed such a model using risk factors that predict an increased risk of thromboembolism (Table 16-2).F16,W4 Aspirin is the agent of choice for patients with no risk factor, and warfarin for those

Warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists are cumbersome to use and require frequent laboratory monitoring. This has led to the search for other drugs that do not require laboratory monitoring. Several have been evaluated in clinical trials, including clopidogrel, idraparinux, and dabigatran.C12 In a large randomized clinical trial of 18,113 patients, dabigatran (a potent direct inhibitor of thrombin) at a dose of 110 mg twice daily was associated with rates of stroke and systemic embolism that were similar to those associated with warfarin, as well as lower rates of hemorrhage.C12 In separate trials, clopidogrel plus aspirin or idraparinux were found to be less effective than warfarin.B14,C11

Restoring and maintaining normal sinus rhythm is desirable because symptoms of discomfort and anxiety related to the arrhythmia are eliminated, hemodynamics are improved, cardiac rate is controlled physiologically, and the risk of thromboembolism may be reduced.

#### *Cardioversion*

Pharmacologic cardioversion involves use of a variety of agents from various classes (Vaughan-Williams) of antiarrhythmic drugs (Tables 16-3 and 16-4). Ibutilide is a class III agent used intravenously for converting atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm.S28 It also lowers atrial defibrillation energy requirements and facilitates transthoracic electrical cardioversion. Ventricular tachyarrhythmia has been associated with the use of this drug in patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction, so it should only be used if QT interval is less than 480 milliseconds. Other drugs employed are class IA (quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide), class IC (flecainide, propafenone), or class III (amiodarone, sotalol)

agents. Each has potentially serious proarrhythmic and other side effects and is effective in only 40% to 60% of cases.

Electrical cardioversion is often combined with drug therapy.

#### Ablation to Block Atrioventricular Conduction

When medical therapy is ineffective in controlling episodes of rapid ventricular rate, catheter ablation of the AV junction to induce complete heart block and implantation of a permanent pacemaker will control it,G6,S7,S8 although atrial flutter or fibrillation persist. Intracoronary ethanol ablation of the AV conduction system is an alternative to radiofrequency (RF) ablation.K2

#### Interruption of Macro-Reentrant Circuits

#### *Cox-Maze III Procedure*

Multiple incisions are made in the atria that not only interrupt conduction routes of the most common reentrant circuits but also direct the sinus node impulse to the AV node along a specified route.C26 The entire atrial myocardium (except for the atrial appendages and the pulmonary veins) is electrically activated by providing multiple blind alleys about 2 to 3 cm wide off the main conduction route between the sinoatrial node and the AV node, thus preserving atrial transport function.C28 A modification of the technique as described by Cox and colleagues, called the maze III procedure with minor changes, is described here.C26,M15

Bicaval cannulation is required (Fig. 16-6) (see "Preparation for Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2). A cannula is inserted directly into the superior vena cava, and the inferior vena cava is cannulated through the right atrium as close as possible to the diaphragm. Small venous cannulae (24F) may be used if active venous uptake is provided by vacuum suction applied to the reservoir of the oxygenator (see "Vacuum-Assisted Venous Return" in Section II of Chapter 2). Perfusion is normothermic to maintain the heartbeat during initial phases of the operation on the right atrium.

The right atrial appendage is excised, removing all trabeculations attached to the appendage. Alternatively and preferably, an incision (see Fig. 16-6, *A*) is made through the tip of the right atrial appendage, extending to the base of the appendage medially and laterally to preserve natriuretic receptors. This incision is extended toward the midpoint of the right atrium. A longitudinal incision is made in the lateral wall of the right atrium along the crista terminalis. This incision extends onto the superior and inferior vena cava. The lower end of the incision is immediately closed to a point about 2 cm cephalad to the inferior vena cava cannula by a continuous suture of 4-0 polypropylene to prevent tearing during retraction. At this point, a vertical incision is made extending anteriorly. The inside of the right atrium is exposed (Fig. 16-6, *B*) so that the intraatrial incision may be extended to the tricuspid valve anulus at about the midpoint of the posterior leaflet. A 3-mm cryolesion is placed at approximately the 2-o'clock position on the tricuspid anulus for 2 minutes at −70°C. All muscle fibers of the right atrial wall are divided, exposing the fat of the AV groove and occasionally the right coronary artery. The atrial incision is closed from the anulus of the tricuspid valve to the free wall of the right atrium by a continuous 4-0 polypropylene suture. An incision is made on the medial aspect of the remnant of the appendage (Fig. 16-6, *C*). This incision extends to the tricuspid valve anulus at the midpoint of the anterior leaflet or approximately at the 10-o'clock position. Another 3-mm cryolesion is placed at the tricuspid anulus for 2 minutes at −70°C.

Systemic cooling is then initiated. The aorta is occluded preparatory to the left atrial portions of the operation. Cold blood cardioplegic solution is administered to the heart via the coronary sinus through an appropriate cannula (Fig. 16-6, *D*) (see "Methods of Myocardial Management during Cardiac Surgery" in Chapter 3). The left atrium is opened by incision just posterior to the interatrial groove near the orifices of the right pulmonary veins. The incision is extended superiorly and inferiorly onto the left atrium around the right pulmonary veins. The atrial septum is incised above the fossa ovalis. The incision is curved across the limbus of the fossa ovalis and across the membrane of the fossa to the inferior margin of the fossa near, but not into, the tendon of Todaro (Fig. 16-6, *E*). The left atrial incision is continued across the left atrium toward the left pulmonary veins to isolate and encircle them. The heart is retracted to the right to expose the left atrial appendage (Fig. 16-6, F), which is excised at its base. It is incised in a cephalad direction near the AV groove across its base and back into the left atrium. The incision in the left atrial appendage is joined to the pulmonary vein encircling incision at a point near the left superior pulmonary vein. The incision in the base of the left atrial appendage is closed back to the encircling incision, and the portion of the encircling incision below the left atrial appendage is closed with continuous sutures of 3-0 polypropylene (Fig. 16-6, *G*). These sutures are passed from the outside into the left atrium and retrieved from within the atrium (Fig. 16-6, *H*). The encircling incision closure is continued cephalad and around the superior aspect to the midpoint of the encircling incision. The encircling incision is closed inferiorly to the midpoint.

An incision is made across the floor of the left atrium to the midpoint of the anulus of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve. This incision is carefully opened by sharp dissection.

The coronary sinus is exposed by incision into the fat of the AV groove. The circumflex coronary artery may also be visualized in the incision. A 15-mm cryoprobe is placed posteriorly on the coronary sinus, and a cryolesion is created at −60°C for 3 minutes. After 1 minute, a 3-mm cryoprobe is placed at the mitral valve anulus at −70°C for 2 minutes. Timing of freezing with the two probes is coordinated so thawing can occur simultaneously. Mitral valve repair or replacement is performed at this point if required. The incision in the floor of the left atrium is closed by a continuous suture of 4-0 polypropylene, beginning at the mitral anulus and continuing to the encircling incision (Fig. 16-6, *I*). The sutures are joined and continued to close the encircling incision over to the right pulmonary veins.

The atrial septum is a thin membrane within the fossa ovalis. The limbus is muscular and thicker. There are discrete layers of the right and left atria that represent the infolding of the atria at the interatrial groove rather than true septum. These layers should be closed separately (Fig. 16-6, *J*). The septal closure begins at the inferior border of the fossa ovalis using continuous sutures of 4-0 polypropylene. Suturing continues across the limbus and along the left atrial fold to the free margin. A second layer of closure is started at the limbus and continued along the right atrial fold to the junction, with the longitudinal incision in the right atrium. The remainder of the pulmonary vein encircling incision is closed and joined to the left atrial septal closure (see Fig. 16-6, *J*).

A venting catheter is inserted via the left superior pulmonary vein through a separate purse-string suture. Air is evacuated from the left cardiac chambers and aorta, and the aortic occlusion clamp is removed (see "Completing Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2). The heart is reperfused and defibrillated if necessary. The longitudinal incision in the right atrium is closed beginning at the superior vena cava and working inferiorly (Fig. 16-6, *K*). The suture is joined to the right atrial septal closure, then continued to the vertical right atrial incision. The vertical incision is closed.

**D,** Aorta is occluded. Coronary sinus is cannulated, and cold cardioplegic solution is administered to achieve total electromechanical arrest. Left atrium is opened on right side behind interatrial groove and in front of pulmonary veins. Incision is extended superiorly and inferiorly. Atrial septum is divided at level of right superior pulmonary vein. This incision is curved inferiorly to divide the membrane of fossa ovalis. **E,** Atrial septum is retracted anteriorly. Pulmonary vein encircling incision is developed, working within left atrium by extending incision across back wall of atrium above and below left pulmonary veins. **Figure 16-6, cont'd**

Operation is completed by closing the right atrial appendage opening, beginning at the midpoint of the right atrium and continuing through the appendage incision.

The maze procedure has been performed experimentally and clinically as a closed heart procedure.C28,L2 Radial incisions in the atria have been proposed as a modification of the maze III procedure by Nitta and colleagues.N7 Atrial incisions radiate from the sinoatrial node toward the AV anular margins to allow a more physiologic atrial activation sequence that may improve atrial transport function. These operations have not substantially reduced the time or complexity required to complete the standard maze III operation.

#### *Modified Maze Procedure*

The maze III procedure is an effective means of relieving atrial fibrillation, but it is a complex and sometimes prolonged procedure. Consequently, it is performed infrequently. A number of modifications of the operation and use of various

![](_page_20_Picture_2.jpeg)

**F,** Heart is retracted inferiorly and to the right to expose left atrial appendage on external surface of heart. Two orientation sutures of 3-0 polypropylene are placed through left pulmonary vein encircling incision at level of left superior and left inferior pulmonary veins. Encircling incision is completed between orientation sutures *(dashed line).* Left atrial appendage is excised at its base. Atrial wall between atrial appendage and encircling incision is divided *(dashed line).* **G,** Orientation sutures are tied, then used to close left atrium between them. Separate suture of 3-0 polypropylene is used to close bridge to and base of left atrial appendage. **Figure 16-6, cont'd**

*Continued*

energy sources to ablate atrial myocardium have been introduced to simplify the operation and reduce operative time.

Modified operations include those applied to only one atrium, the *unilateral* maze procedure. The right-side maze operation creates the usual incisions for the maze procedure on the right atrium only. The left-side Maze procedure is usually a pulmonary vein–encircling incision, with or without extension to the mitral anulus and excision of the left atrial appendage.

Ablation modalities that have been used to obviate the need for incision and closure of atrial tissues include cryoablation or controlled freezing, microwave, RF, and laser energies.G13,V5 Of prime consideration with the use of any energy source is consistent creation of transmural lesions that ensure conduction block. *Cryoablation* has been a widely used modality and is an integral part of the standard maze III procedure to produce tissue ablation at the AV valve anuli and on the coronary sinus. Cryoablation is somewhat cumbersome to apply to atrial tissues and requires specially modified instrumentation. Microwave has been the least employed energy source, and a device to deliver microwave energy has been removed from the market.G15,K16,M2,W11 *Laser* energy applications are in clinical trial.

*RF* energy has been the most frequently used energy source; it heats and shrinks myocardial cells to destroy them. The energy may be applied to produce a focal or linear lesion as alternatives to incisions in conventional maze operations.S23 It can be applied through a unipolar electrode to the endocardial surface of the atria, but may also be applied on the outside of the heart. The objective is to create full-thickness destruction of the wall of the atrium, resulting in scar tissue that blocks reentry pathways that sustain atrial fibrillation. When the energy is applied through an electrode placed directly on the endocardium, surface heating limits depth of

![](_page_21_Picture_2.jpeg)

**H,** Exposure returns to interior of left atrium. Orientation sutures are passed inside left atrium and used to close encircling incision superiorly to midpoint and inferiorly for about 2 cm of posterior wall of left atrium. Vertical incision is developed between encircling incision and mitral valve anulus. Incision is through entire left atrial wall into epicardial fat in atrioventricular groove, exposing coronary sinus. A cryolesion is made on exterior surface of coronary sinus, using a 15-mm cryoprobe applied for 3 minutes. After 1 minute, a 3-mm cryoprobe is placed on mitral valve anulus and a 2-minute cryolesion is made. Vertical incision is closed with 4-0 polypropylene. Mitral valve repair or replacement is performed at this point of operation if indicated. **I,** Pulmonary vein encircling incision is closed to pulmonary veins on right side. Retraction is switched to right atrium, allowing all but final centimeter of encircling incision to be closed. Left ventricular venting catheter is placed through separate incision in right superior pulmonary vein. **Figure 16-6, cont'd**

penetration because once the tissue is destroyed or charred, impedance to energy flow by the injured tissue inhibits further tissue destruction. Cooling the electrode tip and contact surface with saline solution (irrigated RF-Cardioblate, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, Minn.) allows heating to be directed several millimeters below the surface, resulting in a lesion about 4 mm deep.C1,N1 RF energy applied through bipolar electrodes has the potential of assuring a full-thickness lesion. Electrodes placed along the jaws of clamps are placed on the endocardial and epicardial surfaces, with the atrial wall trapped in between. Energy flows until all myocardial tissue capable of conducting the energy is destroyed. Impedance then rises, and a steady state of energy flow is established. Bipolar devices should solve the problem of irregular

**J,** Atrial septum is closed with 4-0 polypropylene suture. Separate sutures are used for left and right atrial surfaces of thick portion of atrial septum. Remainder of encircling incision is closed. **K,** Right atrial incisions are closed. Longitudinal incision is closed, then vertical incision, and finally oblique incision, using 4-0 polypropylene suture. **Figure 16-6, cont'd**

thickness due to trabeculation of the atrial wall, provided uniform electrode contact is assured with atrial tissues. Although thin areas will be destroyed early in the energy flow cycle, thick areas will continue to conduct energy until heating and destruction of tissue is complete. Gillinov and McCarthyG13,G14 showed conduction block in 7 of 10 patients with one application of bipolar RF energy using the Atricure clamp device (Atricure Inc., West Chester, Ohio). Repeat application of the energy achieved block in the remaining three patients. Bipolar probes have been developed that provide access to areas inaccessible to bipolar clamps, such as the valve anuli, vena cavae, and tissue overlying the coronary sinus. However, these probes, as well as cryoprobes, may not create completely transmural lesions.

RF ablation maze procedures performed on both right and left atria appear to achieve about 80% success in restoring sinus rhythm.P7,S23 The number and length of surgically created incisions are reduced compared with the standard maze III procedure by using RF ablation lines as alternatives to or extensions of incisions. The set of surgical incisions for the modified RF maze procedure is shown in Fig. 16-7, *A*. After establishing cardiopulmonary bypass, an incision is

**Figure 16-7** Modified radiofrequency (RF) maze III procedure. **A,** Incisions are depicted. Incision is made through right atrial appendage. Curved incision is made in right atrium extending from atrioventricular groove toward right superior vena cava, crossing crista terminalis. Note relation of this incision posterior and caudal to site of sinoatrial node. Left atrial appendage is amputated at the base. Left atrium is incised on right side posterior to interatrial groove. Left-sided incisions are made later in procedure. **B,** Primary incision is extended laterally and posteriorly into superior vena cava by RF ablation lesion. It is extended similarly into inferior vena cava. Ablation of inferior isthmus is performed by extending a linear lesion from posterior aspect of inferior vena cava across inferior isthmus to anulus of tricuspid valve at its posterior leaflet. Right atrial appendage incision is extended to tricuspid valve anulus by radiofrequency ablation. Aorta is occluded and cold cardioplegia infused through coronary sinus.

**C,** Left atrial appendage is amputated at the base. Working through base of appendage, RF ablation lesion is created anterior to left pulmonary veins. This lesion is connected to base of appendage by RF ablation lesion. Appendage is closed by suture. Working through the primary incision, left pulmonary vein RF ablation lesion is extended posterior to veins to completely encircle them. Encircling lesion is extended to anulus of mitral valve across coronary sinus. Right pulmonary vein encircling lesion is completed by extending RF ablation lesion from primary incision posterior to veins. The two pulmonary vein isolation lesions are joined across posterior and superior aspect of left atrium. **D,** Atrial septum is ablated on left side from fossa ovalis to primary left atrial incision *(inset)*, and on right side from fossa ovalis across limbus to primary incision in right atrium. **Figure 16-7, cont'd**

made through the right atrial appendage. An incision is made in the right atrial lateral wall that curves from the fat over the AV groove toward the right superior pulmonary vein, crossing the crista terminalis. The left-sided surgical incisions to amputate the left atrial appendage and to enter the left atrium posterior to the interatrial groove are also shown, but these incisions are actually made later. Working through the primary incision in the lateral wall of the right atrium (Fig. 16-7, *B*), linear RF ablation lesions are created with a bipolar clamp or probe to extend the primary incision laterally and then posteriorly into the superior vena cava to the level of the caval tourniquet. An inferior isthmus ablation is performed to control atrial flutter by extending the inferior vena cava ablation line across the inferior isthmus to the tricuspid valve anulus at the posterior leaflet. To allow for depolarization of the inferior isthmus, the primary incision is not extended by ablation line to the anulus of the tricuspid valve. The appendage incision is extended to the tricuspid valve anulus by ablation.

A clamp is placed on the ascending aorta, and cold cardioplegic solution is infused by cannula into the coronary sinus (see "Technique of Retrograde Infusion" in Chapter 3). The left atrial appendage is amputated at its base. Working through the base of the appendage, an ablation line is created anterior to the left pulmonary veins and joined to the base of the appendage. The appendage is closed by suture. Working through the primary incision posterior to the interatrial groove into the left atrium (Fig. 16-7, *C*), the left pulmonary vein encircling ablation lesion is completed. This encircling ablation lesion is extended to the anulus of the mitral valve. The right pulmonary vein isolation is completed by extending the primary incision (which is anterior to the veins) posterior to the veins with a RF ablation lesion. The pulmonary vein encircling ablation lesions are connected by RF tissue ablation in one or two locations. A coronary sinus ablation lesion may be added, extending from the mitral anulus lesion along the course of the coronary sinus.

Thickness of the septal tissues makes full-thickness ablation by RF energy somewhat unreliable. In other areas where RF is employed, such as around the AV valves, in the vena cavae, around the pulmonary veins, and over the coronary sinus, the atrial tissues are thin and smooth, making fullthickness tissue penetration by ablation energy easier and more reliable. The atrial septum, therefore, is ablated on both the left atrial endocardial surface from the fossa ovalis to the primary left atrial incision, and on the right atrial endocardium from the fossa ovalis over the limbus to the primary incision in the right atrium (Fig. 16-7, *D*). Surgical incisions are closed in the usual fashion (Fig. 16-7, *E*).

Modified radiofrequency maze III procedures that combine unipolar and bipolar ablation lesions offer the promise of even smaller surgical incisions, as well as assurance of complete-thickness wall lesions. Bipolar ablation is performed for long linear lines crossing thick or irregular atrial wall. Unipolar ablation is performed to extend the bipolar lesions to areas where the tissues are more delicate, such as around the AV valves, in the cavae, or across the coronary sinus. These lesions can also be created with a cryoprobe, but as noted earlier, the lesions created with unipolar RF probes or cryoprobes may not be consistently transmural. Fig. 16-8 shows a lesion set that combines unipolar and bipolar modalities and allows the operation to be performed through four surgical incisions 1 or 2 cm in length, in addition to the incision to amputate the left atrial appendage.

Anatomic studies in human hearts by Castellá and colleaguesC4 have shown that bipolar clamps cannot be used safely to create lesions in the left atrium at the mitral anulus because of possible injury to the coronary sinus and circumflex coronary artery. In the right atrium, clamp placement toward the tricuspid anulus that excluded the right coronary artery left 8 to 18 mm of atrial muscle free from the bipolar electrodes. These authors suggested that lines to the AV anuli should be completed with the cut-and-sew technique.

#### *Less Invasive Surgical Procedures*

During the last decade, a primary objective of most new surgical procedures has been to make them less invasive.C16 Off-pump and minimally invasive techniques incorporating video-assisted thorascopy have been developed.H18,N5,P15,S3,W16 These techniques have used differing energy sources and lesion sets and have principally involved pulmonary vein isolation and amputation of the left atrial appendage.

#### *Catheter-Based Interventions*

A number of catheter-based endocardial techniques have been devised to treat atrial fibrillation,A14,C2,H2,H3,J2,K1,N3 based on the assumption that trigger sites for initiation of atrial fibrillation are found principally within the orifices of the pulmonary veins.H4 These techniques are often not as successful in controlling atrial fibrillation as the maze III procedure.C18,W9 Nevertheless, it is likely more patients will be treated with these techniques in the future because of their less invasive nature.

### RESULTS

#### Ventricular Rate Control

The AFFIRM clinical trial of 4040 patients with atrial fibrillation persisting for more than 6 months has shown at 5-year follow-up that cardiac rate control and anticoagulation results in 40% of patients in normal sinus rhythm and comparable outcomes compared with more aggressive treatment to control the cardiac rhythm.W22 There was no difference in survival, stroke, functional status, or quality of life. Combined rates of death, stroke, major bleeding, and cardiac arrest were 29% in the rate control group vs. 28% in the rhythm control group. Other randomized trials have failed to demonstrate a benefit of rhythm control over rate control, including trials in patients with heart failure and an ejection fraction of 35% or less.H18,O5,R7,V2

### Cardioversion

Drug and electrical cardioversions are nearly always successful for the first episode of atrial fibrillation or flutter. Failure to achieve sinus rhythm increases with subsequent episodes. Recurrence during the first year after cardioversion is at least 50%. The rhythm control arm of the AFFIRM study employed amiodarone, sotalol, propafenone, or procainamide for aggressive medical treatment of atrial fibrillation.W22 At 5-year follow-up, 60% of patients were in normal sinus rhythm, although they required more hospitalizations than the rate control group.

#### Ablation of Atrioventricular Conduction

Quality of life has been considerably improved by catheter ablation of the AV junction.K3 Other than abolishing rapid ventricular rate, it does not protect against thromboembolism or other consequences of atrial flutter or fibrillation.K2

#### Rhythm Control by Surgical Intervention

#### *Maze III Procedure*

Cox and colleagues reviewed outcomes in 346 patients who underwent the maze procedure, 299 of whom underwent the maze III modification.C20 Operative mortality was 2% (CL 1.3%-3.1%). Overall success in curing atrial fibrillation was 99%. There was no permanent damage to the sinoatrial node. Left atrial contractile function after operation occurred in 93% of patients, and right atrial function in 99%.

Schaff and colleagues performed 221 maze procedures in which 75% of patients underwent concomitant operations for associated cardiac disease.S6 Early mortality was 1.4% (CL 0.6%-2.7%), and 85% to 90% of patients were free of atrial fibrillation. In addition to restoring sinus rhythm, mean ejection fraction increased in these patients from 31% to 53%, but 26% had reduced left ventricular ejection fraction.

Arcidi and colleagues reported overall cure of atrial fibrillation in 97% of 99 patients having the maze III procedure, 78 of whom underwent another cardiac operation, usually on cardiac valves.A11

The effect of the maze procedure on stroke was studied in 306 patients followed for up to 12 years.C19 Fifty-eight of these patients had stroke before operation, and there were two perioperative strokes. After operation, only one patient experienced stroke. Warfarin anticoagulation was used in only 45 of the patients who received mechanical or mitral valve prostheses.

#### *Modified Maze Procedures*

The left side unilateral maze procedure is commonly performed by creating either a pulmonary vein–encircling incision or lesion, with or without extension to the mitral valve anulus, or with a cryolesion on the mitral valve anulus, and excision of the left atrial appendage. When energy sources rather than surgical incisions are used to interrupt the macroreentrant circuits, and when fewer lesions are created in the atria, results have been less optimal.D10,S32 Left atrium–only modified maze procedures using RF ablation for creating lesions encircling the pulmonary veins and a lesion extending from this to the mitral anulus were described by Melo and colleagues.M12 Sinus rhythm was restored in 44% of patients. OthersB4,K18 have reported greater success (77%-82%) using left atrial RF lesions applied either endocardially or epicardially. Pasic and colleaguesP5 created encircling RF ablation lines around right and left pulmonary veins separately, joining the left pulmonary vein ablation line to the mitral valve anulus across the coronary sinus, and joining the separate pulmonary vein lines with another lesion on the roof of the atrium. The left atrial appendage was not excised. Freedom from atrial fibrillation was 92% at 6 months. Mohr and colleaguesM20 reported that 81% of 234 patients were in normal sinus rhythm 6 months after having left-side-only atrial ablation using RF energy.

The longest clinical experience with radiofrequency ablation of both atria is that of Sie and colleagues.S22,S23 Two hundred patients were treated with the biatrial modified maze procedure using irrigated RF ablation. Follow-up extended to 80 months, with mean follow-up of 41 months. Normal sinus rhythm or atrial rhythm was present in 73% of patients; 20% remained in atrial fibrillation or flutter, and 6.3% required a permanent pacemaker.

Clinical series have compared left-side-only RF ablation vs. ablation of both atria. In a meta-analysis of 5885 patients undergoing surgical ablation, Barnett and Ad reported that bilateral procedures demonstrated better freedom from atrial fibrillation at all time points (up to 3 years) than left atrial procedures.B1 In a study of 575 patients with permanent atrial fibrillation (duration > 6 months) by Gillinov and colleagues,G12 the Cox-maze procedure and lesion sets resembling it resulted in a similarly low prevalence of late postoperative atrial fibrillation. Pulmonary vein isolation and lesion sets that did not include a lesion to the mitral anulus were less effective. Older age, larger left atrium, and longer duration of atrial fibrillation preoperatively were risk factors for increased prevalence of postoperative atrial fibrillation.

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Patients should be considered for operation when maximal medical therapy has failed to relieve symptoms associated with atrial fibrillation. Symptoms that interfere with lifestyle or ability to work include dyspnea on exertion, easy fatigue, lethargy, malaise, and anxiety or sense of doom during periods of atrial fibrillation.C19 Separation of symptoms due to atrial fibrillation from associated cardiac conditions, primarily valvar heart disease, may be difficult. Operation is not recommended when there is severe left ventricular dysfunction not directly attributable to atrial fibrillation, or when there is associated cardiac or noncardiac disease that would increase the risk of operation. Performing a maze procedure is advisable for patients who are undergoing mitral valve surgery and have documented evidence of atrial fibrillation. Epicardial pulmonary vein isolation can be performed in selected symptomatic patients with aortic valve or coronary artery disease.

#### SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

#### Maze Procedures for Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation

Patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation are often symptomatic with palpitations, irregular heart rhythm, and breathlessness due to intermittent episodes of rapid ventricular rate. They may be refractory to medical treatment. Isolated paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is not a common indication for maze procedures, because satisfactory results can be obtained with catheter ablation, but symptomatic patients may benefit from this therapy. Forty-two patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were treated with a maze III procedure by Lonnerholm and colleagues.L14 A subgroup of 17 patients who had normal sinus rhythm prior to operation and no associated cardiac operation was carefully studied to determine outcomes and atrial function. Sixteen of 17 were in normal sinus rhythm after operation; one was atrially paced. Two years after operation, 10 of 12 patients had normal sinus rhythm (83%; CL 65%-94%), one was paced, and one had nodal rhythm. Left and right atrial size decreased at 2 months, but there was a gradual decrease of left atrial transport function during 2-year follow-up. Fifteen patients (88%; CL 74%-96%) had signs of left atrial contraction.

In patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who are undergoing mitral valve surgery, pulmonary vein isolation may be adequate therapy, particularly when atrial fibrillation is of short duration.G11 If it is of longer duration, a bilateral maze III procedure would be performed.C16 For patients with coronary artery disease or aortic valve disease where a left atriotomy is not otherwise indicated, epicardial pulmonary vein isolation is reasonable.C16

Pulmonary vein isolation as the sole lesion set can be arrhythmogenic, especially in patients with enlarged or

diseased left atria. In this setting, atrial flutter is a frequent postoperative event.C16 Atrial flutter and other arrhythmias also occur after more extensive ablation procedures.M8

Ablation of ganglionated plexi that enter the heart along the pulmonary veins has been proposed as a mechanism to reduce the frequency of atrial fibrillation following pulmonary vein isolation procedures. Several clinical trials of catheter ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation by pulmonary vein isolation in which obliteration of these ganglionic plexi was also performed have demonstrated clinical benefit in terms of lower frequency of recurrence of atrial fibrillation.P1,P14,S5 Experimental studies, however, have demonstrated early reinnervation and vagal activity.O2,S1 Thus, the role of ablation of ganglionated plexi during surgical pulmonary vein isolation procedures for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation has not been clearly established.

#### Standards for Assessing Success or Failure

Uniform standards for assessing success or failure of the various surgical procedures for treatment of atrial fibrillation have not been consistently employed. According to Cox, all occurrences of postoperative atrial fibrillation, atypical left atrial flutter, and classic right atrial flutter should be classified as failures.C16 The methods by which these arrhythmias can be detected postoperatively are variable and controversial. Ad and colleagues evaluated three modalities to determine success of the Cox-maze III procedure: electrocardiography, 24-hour Holter monitoring, and long-term monitoring (5 days).A1 Mean time to monitoring was 9.8 months postoperatively. Electrocardiographic monitoring overestimated success by 12% compared with long-term monitoring. Nearly 50% of the events detected were shorter than 5 minutes for the entire 5-day period. They have suggested that use of a specific algorithm-driven clinical protocol postoperatively, including longitudinal follow-up and long-term monitoring, will increase the success of the various surgical procedures.A2

The central challenge in defining success of ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation is its episodic nature (Fig. 16-9). Frequency of detecting return of atrial fibrillation will therefore depend on frequency and duration of "snapshots" of rhythm (Fig. 16-10).A12 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved use of an implantable loop recorder for continuous monitoring of heart rhythm (Fig. 16-11) using a detection algorithm based on regularity of R-R intervals.H6,M6 Data from this device, as well as from pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, will be required to ascertain the true success of these procedures.

#### Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter Occurring after Cardiac Surgery

Atrial flutter or fibrillation occurs in 20% to 40% of patients after coronary artery bypass grafting.E1,G18 Daubert and Mabo, in a review of five controlled trials, reported a prevalence of 27% to 39%.D3 Occurrence after cardiac valve operations is even greater.B7 Improved operative techniques, anesthesia, and myocardial management have not decreased prevalence. The arrhythmia usually occurs within the first 3 days after operation, although it may occur later. It occurs spontaneously, usually follows a self-limiting course, and becomes chronic in only a small percentage (<5%) of patients.B7,O4 More than 90% of patients have no prior history of atrial arrhythmia and are in normal sinus rhythm within 6 to 8 weeks after operation. Tachycardia can produce symptoms of anxiety and light-headedness. When heart rate is very high for a prolonged period, it may result in hemodynamic compromise, particularly in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. There is an increased risk of thromboembolism associated with atrial fibrillation, with the incidence of stroke approximately three times higher than in patients without postoperative atrial fibrillation.C30,E1,M7 Hospital and late mortality are also increased.A8,E1,E5

The cause of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery is not known and is likely related to a number of factors, most of which are uncontrollable. These include increased catecholamine release, pericardial inflammation, alterations in balance of other neurohormonal agents or electrolytes (hypokalemia), and cellular electrical properties. Age, with its accompanying degenerative changes in atrial myocardium, and systemic arterial hypertension are important risk factors.B7,D3 Other risk factors include decreased left ventricular function, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic renal failure, and diabetes. Withdrawal of β-blockers has also been implicated.J3

Preventing atrial arrhythmias in the postoperative period would be optimal. A number of medications have been administered before and after cardiac operations as prophylaxis against atrial fibrillation. Bharucha and KoweyB7 reviewed management and prevention of atrial fibrillation after cardiac operations and suggested that the only

Note considerable atrial fibrillation burden early after procedure, which gradually subsided until an episode of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with hemodynamic instability *(arrow)*. (From Arya and colleages.A12)

medications with proven benefit are β-blockers. Medications with possible benefit include digitalis, procainamide, sotalol, amiodarone, corticosteroids, and statins.H1,H19,M3,S4,S29,W8 Meta-analysisC6,C31,E1,W21 indicates that β-blockers, sotalol, and amiodarone reduce the frequency of postoperative atrial fibrillation compared with placebo groups, although the magnitude of reduction is variable. These studies include nonblinded trials. Atrial pacing may be beneficial when combined with medical prophylaxis.B10,D3,G18 Calcium channel blockers have not proven to be effective.

Because postoperative atrial fibrillation has a self-limited course in most patients with no history of prior atrial arrhythmia, treatment strategy is directed toward control of ventricular response rate.B7 First-line drugs of choice are β-blockers. Digoxin is sometimes administered via rapid intravenous administration, partly because of tradition and because it may be helpful in slowing the ventricular response and restoring sinus rhythm, but scientific data are not supportive.W5 Calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem), which affect the AV node, also control ventricular rate, but the effect is transient unless given as a continuous intravenous infusion. They are no more effective than β-blockers in controlling ventricular rate. Intravenous amiodarone may be beneficial in controlling ventricular rate or restoring sinus rhythm. Pharmacologic cardioversion is desirable, but there is no drug that is uniformly successful. Ibutilide given intravenously has been most effective in patients with atrial flutter,V1 but it is proarrhythmic and may cause sustained ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes) in about 2% to 4% of patients.M25

Anticoagulation is initiated if sinus rhythm is not restored within 48 hours after the onset of atrial fibrillation, because the risk of thromboembolism increases at that point. This is especially important if electrical cardioversion is anticipated. Conventional recommendations for anticoagulation are followed. Intravenous heparin or one of its analogs is administered with warfarin and continued until a therapeutic level of anticoagulation is established.

Electrical cardioversion may be performed. Ordinary transthoracic cardioversion is usually successful. Cardioversion may be applied urgently for patients with rapid ventricular response and hemodynamic instability. Antiarrhythmic drugs are continued for at least 3 weeks following successful electrical cardioversion.

Guidelines for prevention and management of postoperative atrial fibrillation have been published jointly by the ACC, AHA, and ESCF16 and are summarized in Box 16-6.

#### Pacing and Other Methods of Atrial Electrical Cardioversion

Temporary epicardial wire pacing electrodes placed during cardiac operations and used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes have been part of standard postoperative cardiac care for many years.W2,W3 Ideally, two electrodes are placed **Box 16-6** Management of Atrial Fibrillation after Cardiac Surgery

on the right atrium and the right ventricle. An atrial electrode may be used to diagnose atrial arrhythmia simply by attaching the wire to the chest lead of the ECG. This magnifies the atrial electrical activity and permits identification of large P waves of sinus rhythm, rapid spikes of atrial flutter, or the disorganized atrial electrical activity of atrial fibrillation. Attaching atrial electrodes to a rapid-rate external pacemaker with rate set at 400 to 800 beats · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> overdrives the atrial arrhythmic rate. Gradual reduction of the pacing rate may capture the atrium at a lower rate and convert atrial rhythm to normal sinus. Experience has shown that success in conversion to sinus rhythm occurs in about one of four patients. Success is higher when atrial overdrive pacing is done for atrial flutter (65% of patients converted) and when the patient is pretreated with an intravenous β-blocker (metoprolol 2.5 to 5 mg intravenously).P9

Temporary defibrillation electrodes may also be placed on the atria at the time of cardiac operation and used to deliver low-energy direct current cardioversion of atrial fibrillation. Liebold and colleagues reported use of epicardial defibrillation wire electrodes placed on the left and right atria during cardiac operations in 100 consecutive patients.L10 Atrial fibrillation occurred in 23 patients (23%). The atrial electrodes were used to deliver synchronous monophasic shocks with low energies ranging from 2 to 10 J. Defibrillation was successful in 16 of 20 patients (80%). Sedation was required during defibrillation in 30% of patients. Electrode wires and a device to reduce the output of a standard defibrillator to 9 J has been developed (Syncrus, Guidant, Santa Clara, Calif.). Patel and colleaguesP6 used this device in 45 patients; 16 (35%) developed atrial fibrillation. Fifteen patients were successfully cardioverted at initial treatment, one 6 hours later, and 4 after atrial fibrillation recurred. This technique was based on experimental defibrillation in experimental models.C7,O7 Waldo suggested that this technique of lowenergy atrial defibrillation with temporary epicardial wire electrodes should become standard in treatment of atrial fibrillation after open heart surgery.W2 More important, he proposed that use and success of temporary electrodes opened the way for implantable atrial defibrillators to provide automatic atrial defibrillation. Wellens and colleagues reported implanting a defibrillator (Atrioverter) connected to electrodes placed in the right atrium and coronary sinus in 51 patients with recurrent atrial fibrillation who did not respond to antiarrhythmic drugs.W7 Successful defibrillation of the atrium was accomplished in 96% of 227 episodes of atrial fibrillation in 41 patients without inducing ventricular arrhythmia. Devices are available that can detect and treat atrial tachyarrhythmias with pacing and high-energy defibrillation.K5

# **Section V Ventricular Tachycardia and Ventricular Fibrillation in Ischemic Heart Disease**

#### HISTORICAL NOTE

In 1938, Parkinson and colleagues apparently first noticed the association between ventricular aneurysm and intractable ventricular tachycardia.P2 However, the problem seemed to be known to Sir Thomas Lewis, who stated in 1909 the need for studying and understanding the condition by a controlled method of inducing tachycardia.L7 This need was met in 1967 when Durrer and colleagues in Holland, and Coumel and colleagues in France, introduced the technique of programmed electrical stimulation of the human heart.C15,D14

The first surgical approach to treating life-threatening ventricular tachycardia in patients with ischemic heart disease was reported in 1959 by Couch using simple aneurysmectomy.C14 Fontaine, Frank, and Guiraudon reported surgical epicardial mapping as an adjunct to this kind of surgery in 1974, and Gallagher and colleagues reported successful use of ventricular aneurysm resection guided by electrophysiologic mapping in 1975.F6,G3 In 1978, Guiraudon and colleagues introduced encircling endocardial ventriculotomy as a method of directly treating life-threatening ventricular tachycardia in patients with ischemic heart disease.G20 Harken and colleagues reported electrophysiologically directed endocardial resection as a method of treatment in 1980.H8

An entirely new concept of interventional management was introduced in 1980 when Mirowski and colleagues reported implanting a cardioverter-defibrillator in humans.M18 This important event was preceded by more than 10 years of work directed at this endpoint and nearly 100 years of experimental and clinical studies of increasing sophistication.M17,S10,T5

#### MORPHOLOGY

Sustained ventricular tachycardia is an uncommon complication of ischemic heart disease in the absence of a previous myocardial infarction. It occurs most commonly in patients in whom a large area of infarction has developed, and particularly in those with a left ventricular aneurysm. These patients have, as a group, more left ventricular impairment than patients without this life-threatening complication. Thus, Kirklin and colleagues reported that patients undergoing operations for ventricular tachycardia had a mean ejection fraction of 30%, similar to that of patients undergoing surgical treatment for left ventricular aneurysm, whereas those undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting had a mean ejection fraction of 51% (*P* = .0001).K10 However, lifethreatening ventricular tachycardia develops in only a minority of patients with ischemic heart disease and left ventricular aneurysm with impaired left ventricular function. Although all the determinants of which patients are affected by ventricular tachycardia are not clear, septal involvement in the scarring seems to be one of them.C9

The morphologic substrate for ventricular tachycardia in ischemic heart disease resides for the most part in the subendocardium of the left ventricle and left ventricular aspect of the ventricular septum. This substrate is most commonly near the border of an aneurysm or infarct. Virtually all hearts with a myocardial infarction have a mixture of myocardial cells and fibrous tissue in at least some areas of the left ventricle; such areas provide a basis for slow conduction and conduction block, two conditions necessary for ventricular reentry to occur.W13 Thus, in areas of the subendocardium where ventricular tachycardia may begin, bundles of viable myocardial cells are embedded in dense connective tissue.F2,P11 These bundles may consist of Purkinje fibers or ventricular muscle fibers or both. These generally parallel muscle bundles do not appear to connect to fibers within the ventricular wall, and in regions where ventricular tachycardia seems to originate, there may be no surviving myocardial cells above the subendocardium. Thus, the surviving subendocardial muscle bundles are generally connected to the rest of the ventricle across the borders of subendocardial portions of the scar.

This arrangement of parallel bundles of myocardial fibers separated by fibrous or connective tissue forms a nonuniform anisotropic (conducting in one direction) structure that is considered an ideal substrate for reentrant circuits. Conduction between muscle bundles is probably slow, whereas conduction along the length of the muscle bundles is probably rapid. The fractionated character of electrograms recorded from such regions is also probably related to the nonuniform anisotropic anatomy. It is hypothesized that the larger the proportion of left ventricle involved with these morphologic characteristics, the greater the possibility that reentrant circuits develop, activate contiguous subendocardium, and provoke ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Actual time and place of development of the electrical phenomenon responsible for ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) appears to be determined by chance.

Even among individuals with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias but without any other evidence of cardiac disease, a morphologic substrate likely to be responsible for the arrhythmia is usually found. Sugrue and colleagues report several different types of histopathologic abnormalities in such patients coming to autopsy, including myocardial cellular hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, myocardial degenerative changes, and acute myocarditis.S33

#### CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

#### Pathophysiology

Most life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in patients with ischemic heart disease arise as a result of macro- or microreentry circuits, but some result from normal or abnormal automaticity or triggered activity. In many patients, the abnormal impulse breaks through onto the endocardial surface near its origin, resulting in the earliest ventricular electrical activation at this point. Its breakthrough onto the epicardial surface may be some distance away.

#### Symptoms

In some patients, sudden death is the first manifestation of important ventricular tachyarrhythmia. In others, premature ventricular contractions, ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation causes the first symptoms during recovery from a myocardial infarction. In still others, frequent palpitations, sometimes accompanied by faintness or syncope, are the presenting complaint.

#### Signs

The diagnostic finding is a verified history of life-threatening ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, or sustained ventricular tachycardia induced during electrophysiologic study.

#### NATURAL HISTORY

Sustained ventricular tachycardias and fibrillation may occur within the first 48 hours after an acute myocardial infarction but do not worsen prognosis; they are presumably ischemic in origin. Such arrhythmias occurring later in the course of recovery are less common but worsen prognosis.G16 Episodes are often multiple, and when they occur, in-hospital mortality is as high as 60%.L9,W1 Such patients generally have inducible ventricular tachycardia when studied by programmed electrical stimulation, and a poor long-term prognosis even with intense medical therapy. Marchlinski and colleagues reported only 20 (50%; CL 41%-59%) of 40 such patients alive after a mean follow-up period of 20 months, with more than half the deaths occurring suddenly.M4 As is the case in other patients with ischemic heart disease, prognosis of medically treated patients with life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias is adversely affected by presence of severe proximal anterior descending coronary artery stenosis.V6

Some patients present after resuscitation from sudden death. The most important risk factors for sudden death in patients are advanced functional disability, as indicated by New York Heart Association functional class; lack of response to therapy, as judged by programmed electrical stimulation; and depressed left ventricular function. The natural history of individuals resuscitated from sudden death is highly variable, but in general is not favorable. Swerdlow and colleagues found that 34% of resuscitated patients died suddenly within 3 years of their first episode.S35

Ability of medical treatment to improve natural history is limited because an effective antiarrhythmic drug can be identified by electrophysiologic testing in less than 35% of cases.S27,S34 Empirical therapy with high-dose amiodarone has been favorable in several large series.H12,M22 However, in an appreciable number of patients, severe adverse drug reactions or aggravation of arrhythmic symptoms develop.F5,V3

### TECHNIQUE OF INTERVENTION

Because even type of intervention remains arguable, techniques for intervention continue to be modified.

A direct surgical approach, usually at the time of ventricular aneurysmectomy and coronary artery bypass grafting, consists of electrophysiologic mapping at surgery and procedures designed to isolate the presumed arrhythmogenic focus from the rest of the ventricular mass. Mapping has been done sequentially or with special arrays of electrodes and computerbased electrophysiologic analyses that allow all the information to be obtained during a few heartbeats.K19,L1,M14,O8

Cryoablation techniques have been used to electrically isolate the arrhythmogenic focus. When the ventricular tachycardia is monomorphic, catheter ablation techniques in the cardiac electrophysiologic laboratory can also be effective. This, however, has been the case in a minority of patients.

The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) has come to be the most appropriate method of treating most patients with life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias resulting from ischemic heart disease. Implantation methods have improved over time such that it has become possible to insert an ICD using techniques similar to pacemaker insertion. Two electrodes are required and, although larger in diameter than those employed for pacemaking, may be inserted by needle and guidewire technique using direct puncture of the subclavian vein. ICD pulse generators are larger than those of a pacemaker. A larger subcutaneous pocket is required, but the device can be placed in a prepectoral position below the clavicle. Operation for inserting and testing the device is performed under local anesthesia with intravenous conscious sedation, although general anesthesia is sometimes required.

#### RESULTS

#### Direct Surgical Approach

Most patients with ischemic heart disease undergoing interventional therapy for life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias die in cardiac failure, not suddenly or with an intractable arrhythmia.M9,O8 This fact, plus its considerable early and late risks approach, accounts for lack of enthusiastic acceptance by cardiologists of direct surgical treatment of life-threatening ventricular tachycardia in patients with ischemic heart disease. Improved early mortalities have been reported by others, but a highly favorable effect on long-term survival has not been demonstrated.J4,L1,M14,O9,O10 Again, this is largely related to the fact that left ventricular structure and function tend to be poor in this subset of patients.

#### Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator

Increasing evidence as to the efficacy of ICD devices, coupled with low hospital mortality after their insertion, has made them virtually the therapy of choice in patients with ischemic heart disease in whom life-threatening intractable ventricular tachyarrhythmias develop.E2,F4,H7,K14 Operative mortality associated with transvenous ICD implantation is 0.5% to 0.8%.S2,Z1 Even with this device in place, poor left ventricular function adversely affects prognosis.K8 Recurrence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias is observed in 30% to 50% of patients after ICD implantation, yet only 1% to 2% of patients die of sudden cardiac death.G19

ICDs successfully terminate ventricular fibrillation in 98% of cases. Ventricular tachycardia is successfully converted by overdrive pacing in 89% to 91% of cases, and when not successful, defibrillation shock terminates the arrhythmia in 98% of cases. Antiarrhythmia pacing features add 5% to 10% to the cost of ICDs, but it has been shown that antiarrhythmia pacing is activated frequently (68% of patients) and will terminate the arrhythmia in as high as 96% of arrhythmia episodes.W20 Inappropriate pacing or shocks are delivered typically for atrial fibrillation, with rapid ventricular response in 5% to 11% of patients. Dual-chamber sensing and pacing ICDs should largely eliminate inappropriate pacing or shocks in patients with associated atrial arrhythmias.

Prospective randomized trials have shown improved patient survival for patients treated with an ICD compared with those receiving drug therapy, including those receiving class III antiarrhythmic drugs, with estimated risk reduction of 39% at 1 year and 31% at 3 years.G19

#### INDICATIONS FOR INTERVENTIONAL THERAPY

Results of drug therapy for managing patients with ischemic heart disease and recurring ventricular tachyarrhythmias have been disappointing.C3 Some patients requiring surgical therapy for a left ventricular aneurysm with otherwise excellent ventricular function and important coronary stenoses only in the anterior descending coronary artery may be treated by bypass grafting to the anterior descending coronary artery, resection of the left ventricular aneurysm, and electrophysiologically directed cryoablation for the control of the tachyarrhythmia. Patients whose tachycardia is monomorphic should be considered for catheter ablation, which is successful in about half of patients.M23

Most patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, however, are best treated by insertion of an ICD. In response to publication of numerous studies showing that ICD insertion can alter the natural history of cardiac arrhythmia and major advances in the technology of automatic cardioversion by pacing therapy or defibrillation by shock therapy, the ACC, AHA, NASPE, and HRS appointed a committee of physicians to develop guidelines for implantation of ICDs.G19 An updated summary of these indications is listed in Box 16-7. E9 This comprehensive document is a definitive statement on indications for cardiac pacemaking. Because device development continues to advance rapidly, these indications may be subject to frequent revision.

a few myocardial fibers between epicardium and endocardium, is often included within this group of patients.U1 In other patients, the right ventricular free wall has both thick and thin areas of pathologic development. The basic pathologic process is believed to be progressive replacement of myocardial fibers in the subepicardium and mid-myocardium by fatty tissue.F8 Characteristically, the right ventricle is enlarged and deformed by bulging areas over the infundibulum, apex, and basal portion of the inferior wall.G21 Involvement of the right ventricle is initially regional and may progress to global involvement of the right ventricle. The left ventricle may eventually be involved, but the septum is spared. The disease is often familial, with autosomal dominant inheritance but incomplete penetrance.

Intractable ventricular tachycardia may develop in childhood or in adult life in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia.D12,H14,M5 Strands of partially degenerated myofibrillar fascicles, which connect with normal myocardium, are believed to provide a basis for slow conduction and reentry.F9 Electrophysiologic studies are indicated. Rarely, a site of monomorphic inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia can be identified, and catheter ablation is then the treatment of choice (Epstein A: personal communication; 1991). More often it is polymorphic and multifocal and resistant to drug therapy. Right ventricular isolation is then an effective therapy.C21 This extensive procedure does not change regional right ventricular systolic or diastolic performance.D2 In some patients, a properly oriented simple ventriculotomy, cutting across the arrhythmogenic focus, is recommended, although at times a localized resection has been done.F7,F9,G21

#### ARRHYTHMOGENIC LEFT VENTRICULAR DYSPLASIA

In arrhythmogenic left ventricular dysplasia, a rare cause of intractable ventricular tachycardia, the histopathologic substrate is the same as in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia but with more fibrosis.F9 Preoperative and intraoperative electrophysiologic studies are said to identify the condition, and encircling endocardial ventriculotomy is performed to stop the arrhythmia.F9

#### IDIOPATHIC INTRACTABLE VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA

Idiopathic intractable ventricular tachycardia has also occasionally been treated surgically. In one report, the tachycardia seemed to originate in the left ventricular free wall in one of three cases and in the ventricular septum in the other two cases.F9 However, the report of Sugrue and colleagues casts doubt on the idiopathic nature of such cases.S33 Most commonly, idiopathic intractable ventricular tachycardias are treated with calcium channel blocking agents and other drugs. In a small subset of patients, this tachycardia arises in the right ventricular outflow tract and is amenable to catheter ablation.K15
