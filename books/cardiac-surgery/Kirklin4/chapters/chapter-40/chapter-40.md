Key: *PA,* Pulmonary artery; *PT,* pulmonary trunk.

#### Pulmonary Valve

The pulmonary valve is usually better developed in infants and children with severe pulmonary stenosis than it is in neonates. Although the cusp tissue may have a myxomatous appearance and may be irregularly deformed and thickened, the two, three, or even four pulmonary valve cusps are relatively well formed with only partial commissural fusion.G10,S3 In adults, the valve may become calcified, particularly when there has been preexisting infective endocarditis.D5 In older patients, a variable amount of infundibular hypertrophy results in secondary infundibular stenosis. Occasionally, infundibular stenosis alone accounts for RV outflow tract obstruction (Table 39-3).

#### Pulmonary Arteries

Post-stenotic dilatation of the pulmonary trunk (see Fig. 39-5) is characteristic of this malformation and is present in about 70% of infants and children with this lesion.F1,G6 The left pulmonary artery may be involved as well.

#### Right Ventricle

In older patients, in contrast to neonates, important hypoplasia of the RV is uncommon, although marked thickening of the ventricular wall is often seen. When this thickening involves the infundibular septum and free wall of the RV, severe subvalvar obstruction gradually develops.K5 This has been anecdotally referred to as the "suicidal tendency" of the RV of patients with important pulmonary stenosis. In occasional cases, a low-lying and large moderator band or so-called anomalous muscle bands contribute to infundibular obstruction. In about 10% to 20% of patients, these are the only sites of obstruction, the valve being either normal or (rarely) bicuspid, but not stenotic (see Section V of Chapter 38).

#### Tricuspid Valve

In infants and children, the tricuspid valve is usually morphologically normal. However, mild regurgitation or, in the face of RV failure, moderate or severe regurgitation may develop.

#### Right Atrium

The right atrial wall is hypertrophied secondary to increased right atrial pressure. In about one fourth of infants and adults, the atrial septum is intact. However, in most the foramen ovale is patent, or there is a small ostium secundum ASD; right-to-left shunting results in cyanosis.F2,K5 When a left-toright shunt is present, there is usually a large ASD and only mild or moderate pulmonary stenosis.R7

#### Left Ventricle

Alterations in the LV (e.g., myocardial infarction, myocardial dysplasia, obstructive changes in the coronary arteries, abnormal media of the ascending aorta) have been shown occasionally to coexist with pulmonary stenosis and intact ventricular septum.B2,S6 Muscular subaortic stenosis of the variety seen in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy may coexist. A combination of muscular subaortic and subpulmonary obstruction may be associated with abnormal facies and is a possible variant of Noonan syndrome.N2 Important valvar pulmonary stenosis in infants and children can adversely affect LV function.H3 This is largely the result of RV hypertension that displaces the septum toward the left and alters LV geometry.S4 Cardiac output and LV function are adversely affected, but the abnormalities revert to normal after correction of the RV outflow obstruction.

#### Associated Anomalies

Pulmonary stenosis and intact ventricular septum occurs frequently in Noonan syndrome, which is characterized by small stature, hypertelorism, mild mental retardation, cardiac malformations (most commonly pulmonary stenosis), and at times ptosis, undescended testes, and skeletal malformations.L5,N2 It is also associated with intrauterine rubella.

#### CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

#### Symptoms

Infants may be symptomatic but usually have less severe symptoms than neonates. After the first year, patients often present because of a murmur only, produced by mild or moderate stenosis. In the second, third, and fourth decades, presentation may be with chronic RV failure. In all, 30% to 40% of patients are asymptomatic when first examined.F1,K3 When symptoms occur, the earliest is often effort dyspnea, which results from inability to increase pulmonary (and thus systemic) blood flow with exercise because of the relatively fixed resistance of the pulmonary valve.A3,F1

Cyanosis appears when, in the presence of an interatrial communication, the RV becomes less compliant than the LV or its pressure becomes severely elevated. With a normally developed RV, this occurs only when its pressure is suprasystemic, and is associated with ECG evidence of considerable RV hypertrophy. When cyanosis is marked in older patients, polycythemia becomes severe, and all the complications associated with this condition can develop (see "Clinical Presentation" under Clinical Features and Diagnostic Criteria in Section I of Chapter 38).M11 However, these patients rarely squat for symptomatic relief as do those with tetralogy of Fallot.A3,F1

This group is discussed in more detail in Section V of Chapter 38. Includes only patients receiving combined valvotomy and infundibular resection.

Effort-related precordial pain is not uncommon and is presumably due to RV angina. Sudden death can occur in cyanotic and acyanotic children and in young adults.M11,W3

Patients in the second and third decades of life with severe and long-neglected pulmonary stenosis and intact ventricular septum show development of right heart failure with elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatomegaly, and ascites, which eventually leads to death.

#### Signs

Except in young infants with severe heart failure, a systolic murmur (best heard in the second left interspace) is present, often with a thrill. Peak intensity of the murmur occurs later in systole in those with severe rather than mild stenosis.G2 The pulmonary component of the second sound may be normal, decreased, or inaudible, whereas the aortic component is usually obscured by the murmur. The tighter the pulmonary stenosis, the longer the RV ejection time and the greater the delay in pulmonary valve closure.G2,V1

In severe stenosis, an ejection click is absent because the dome of the pulmonary valve is pushed upward into the pulmonary trunk by the vigorous right atrial contraction before ventricular systole occurs. In some patients with mild stenosis, the abnormality of cusp movement may be insufficient to produce a click, although in other patients it may be prominent, the sound being magnified by a dilated pulmonary trunk.

The hypertrophied RV can often be appreciated as an RV heave palpable to the left of the sternum. The jugular venous "a" wave increases in amplitude as pulmonary stenosis increases in severity and is made more obvious by a noncompliant RV.W3 In older children, diagnosis of associated RV hypoplasia is suspected when signs of pulmonary stenosis are combined with heart failure and cyanosis in the absence of severe RV hypertrophy on the ECG. Thus, in contrast to pulmonary stenosis with a normally developed RV, cyanosis may occur when its pressure is less than systemic and the ECG is unremarkable.S1,W2

#### Electrocardiography

Right atrial enlargement from moderate or severe pulmonary stenosis is reflected in prominent P waves in the ECG.S5 When pulmonary stenosis is mild or moderate, the R-wave height in V1 is less than 10 mm, or there is a pattern of incomplete right bundle branch block. When it is severe, the R or R′ in V1 becomes greater than 10 mm and corresponding in its height to degree of RV hypertension.E3

#### Echocardiography

In children and adults, as well as neonates, two-dimensional echocardiography can provide near-certain diagnosis. The thickened, immobile, or domed pulmonary valve can be imaged, along with post-stenotic enlargement of the pulmonary trunk and RV thickening. Severity of stenosis can be estimated by Doppler evaluation of the flow across the pulmonary valve in systole, and this can be confirmed by similar evaluation of the velocity of flow in the tricuspid valve regurgitant jet, if present. Echocardiography can also be used to diagnose restrictive RV physiology by demonstrating forward flow across the pulmonary valve in late diastole. This physiology can be present in up to 42% of adults with moderate or severe stenosis and correlates with increased symptoms.L2

#### Cardiac Catheterization and Cineangiography

Techniques and findings are the same as those described in Section I.

#### NATURAL HISTORY

Pulmonary stenosis with intact ventricular septum accounts for about 10% of congenital heart disease and is thus a common malformation. Most surgical series show a predominance of females.

#### Patients Presenting in Infancy

Patients who survive the neonatal period to present later in infancy have a wide variation in degree of pulmonary valve narrowing. About 40% (CL 32%-47%) have mild obstruction, 47% (CL 39%-54%) moderate, and only 14% (CL 9%-20%) severe. However, these percentages probably underestimate the proportion of patients in this age group with severe obstruction. Nugent and colleagues found that 58% (CL 51%-64%) of an unselected group of infants presenting in the first 2 years (*n* = 81) with this entity had severe RV outflow obstruction.N3 Even in early life, and probably more so as time passes, infundibular (muscular) narrowing adds to RV output resistance.

When RV outflow obstruction is severe in infants and young children, heart failure, cyanosis, or both are common (more so than in older patients who have developed the same degree of obstruction).L4,N3 Prognosis of this group is poor. Levine and Blumenthal found that 56% of patients with heart failure died during follow-up.L4

Even when obstruction is moderate in this young age group, an important proportion have heart failure, with its same poor prognostic implication. It is probable that a degree of RV hypoplasia is often implicated in heart failure under these circumstances. According to Mody's study of 17 patients with moderate RV outflow tract obstruction in the first year, 53% (CL 38%-68%) experienced progression to a severe lesion in the next several years (average 4.5 years).M8 Similar conclusions can be drawn from the data of Wennevold and Jacobsen and Danilowicz and colleagues.D2,W1

Even in asymptomatic infants with mild stenosis, Anand and Mehta reported rapid progression requiring intervention within 6 months in 15%.A2 Experience of others, however, contradicts this, indicating that progression of mild pulmonary stenosis (gradient of <40 mmHg) in infants is rare and is similar to the natural history of mild pulmonary stenosis diagnosed in older children.A4,D6

#### Patients Presenting after Infancy

Patients with isolated pulmonary stenosis that produces mild RV outflow obstruction (peak pressure gradient between RV and pulmonary trunk ≤ 25 mmHg or RV peak pressure ≤ 50 mmHg) have a predicted probability of survival equal to that of an age-gender-ethnicity–matched general population.H4 These patients rarely experience progression of pulmonary stenosis and therefore rarely require interventional therapy.H4,M8,M9,M10 Recent studies by Rowland and colleagues and Gielen and colleagues corroborate earlier findings.G7,R12

Patients with moderately severe obstruction (peak pressure gradient between RV and pulmonary trunk > 25 mmHg but < 50 mmHg, or RV peak pressure > 50 mmHg but < 80 mmHg) sometimes experience progression in severity of their RV outflow obstruction. Without progression, as best as can be gleaned from currently available information, predicted probability of survival for at least 25 years is excellent.H4

Patients with severe pulmonary stenosis are susceptible to eventual development of chronic heart failure (and thus premature death), the tendency being greater the older the patient. Secondary changes in the severely stenotic valve probably make it more obstructive as time passes, with the outflow tract becoming more hypertrophied and stenotic and the RV becoming thicker, more fibrotic, less contractile, and less compliant.H1 In women with severe pulmonary stenosis who are in New York Heart Association functional class I or II, pregnancy is not associated with an increase in fetal or maternal complications, in contrast to similar disease of the mitral or aortic valve.

#### Effect of Right Ventricular Hypoplasia

RV hypoplasia seems to affect natural history unfavorably. However, some patients with hypoplasia do not die in infancy but present later in life, usually with progressive cyanosis from a right-to-left shunt at atrial level. Left untreated, progressive right heart failure develops and causes death.

#### TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

#### Comment

In infants, children, and adults, as in neonates, percutaneous balloon valvotomy is the treatment of choice for valvar pulmonary stenosis. If this is not successful, or is not indicated, open surgical valvotomy using CPB is performed. Balloon valvotomy is ineffective in most cases of dysplastic pulmonary valve, and when the valve anulus is hypoplastic (*z* value < −3). The surgical technique is that described in Section I. When transanular patching is necessary, the technique is also that described in Section I.

#### Open Operation during Cardiopulmonary Bypass

The general aspects of operation described in Section I are applicable to pulmonary valvotomy in infants and adults. After the pulmonary trunk is opened through a vertical incision, valvotomy is performed (Fig. 39-10). When edges of the cusps are bulky and obstructive, and particularly when the valve is bicuspid, partial or complete valvectomy may be necessary, because a taut bicuspid valve cannot open properly even after incision of the two fused commissures. RV, LV, and pulmonary artery pressures are measured at this point, but they are of little value in decision making (see Special Features of Postoperative Care later). A polyvinyl catheter is placed to measure RV pressure. It can be brought from the pulmonary artery out the low RV or alternatively, can be advanced forward from the right atrium through the tricuspid valve. Pressure measurements made the following morning may indicate the need for return to the operating room for relief of infundibular or anular stenosis.

When an infundibular resection is indicated (Fig. 39-11), a vertical infundibular incision is preferred. After resection, the incision is closed using an oval-shaped patch of PTFE or pericardium. In a few patients, a transanular patch is required because of a small pulmonary valve anulus. Patients requiring this often have dysplastic pulmonary valves. Cineangiogram or echocardiogram may suggest need for the transanular patch, but the final decision is usually made in the operating room. At the time of valvotomy through the pulmonary arteriotomy, the anulus is sized with Hegar dilators. If it is small (*z* value of −3 or less), the arteriotomy is carried across the anulus and down the infundibular free wall. If there is doubt about need for transanular patching, the pulmonary arteriotomy is left open and a vertical incision made in the infundibulum.

After muscle resection has been accomplished, the anulus is again sized by Hegar dilators passed through the valve from below. If it is too small, the two incisions are joined by cutting across the anulus, and a transanular patch is inserted (see "Decision and Technique for Transanular Patching" under Technique of Operation in Section I of Chapter 38). Deleon and colleagues have described a reconstructive operation for patients with dysplastic pulmonary valve with hypoplastic anulus that preserves valve function.D4 However, the experience involves only two patients, and follow-up is limited.D4

In the occasional patient with stenosis of the pulmonary trunk or branches in whom these have not, or cannot, be treated adequately by balloon dilatation and stenting, the narrowed pulmonary branch is dissected to a point beyond the stenosis and an enlarging repair made (see Technique of Operation in Section I of Chapter 38). Preliminary dissection of these branches is best made during CPB cooling. These stenoses must be identified in detail at preoperative cardiac catheterization.

#### SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Postoperative care is accomplished as described in Chapter 5. One special feature is that RV pressure should be assessed on the first postoperative day. This is accomplished by monitoring the RV pressure or withdrawal of the pulmonary artery pressure catheter that was placed at operation into the RV. These pressures are more reliable in predicting late results from operation than those taken in the operating room. However, if the patient's hemodynamic state is good, reoperation within a few days of the initial procedure is rarely necessary, even when RV pressure is high, because of the known tendency for infundibular hypertrophy to regress with time.

#### RESULTS

#### Survival

#### *Early (Hospital) Death*

Hospital mortality is essentially zero after percutaneous balloon valvotomy.M1,M2,R1,R2 It is very low after surgical valvotomy as well and has been for many years.D1,E1,M3,P2,R11 It approaches zero when patients with severe RV hypoplasia or advanced chronic heart failure are excluded.

Young age (down to 1 month) is not a risk factor. The few deaths that occur are associated either with severe

As this is done, the surgeon and an assistant must carefully stabilize the cusp on either side to avoid inaccuracy in making the incision. If necessary, thickened valve tissue around the orifice may be resected, or a cusp may be partially detached. However, this is done only if the opening is otherwise unacceptable, because some degree of regurgitation results. When infundibular dissection and resection are also required, RV is opened through a vertical incision in the infundibulum. After performing the dissection and resection, vertical ventriculotomy is closed with a small oval patch of polytetrafluoroethylene or pericardium inserted with continuous polypropylene suture.

RV hypoplasia or, particularly in adults, advanced chronic heart failure.

#### *Time-Related Survival*

Long-term survival is the rule after surgical treatment. In the early Mayo Clinic experience, survival out to 25 years after hospital discharge was 91% in the overall group, but this was importantly affected by age at operation.K6 Survival for at least 25 years after hospital discharge was 93% for those aged 0 to 4 years at operation, 100% for those aged 4 to 10 years at operation, 92% for those aged 11 to 20 years, and 71% for those older than 21 at operation.K6 Although neonates were not represented in this experience, infants were, and this probably accounts for the effect of age in that era.

In a more recent longitudinal study of 51 patients, with follow-up ranging from 22 to 33 years (mean 25 years), late survival was 96%.R11 Long-term survival is now available following balloon valvotomy. Fawzy and colleagues report 2- to 17-year follow-up (mean 10 years) in 90 patients, with no late deaths.F3 All patients were older at the time of balloon intervention in this study, ranging from 15 to 54 years. Gupta and colleagues reported a single death in 166 patients,G13 and Jarrar and colleagues report no late deaths in 62 patientsJ1 during follow-up.

#### Hemodynamic Outcomes and Reintervention

Immediate relief of the gradient usually is obtained, and it is rare for adequate initial relief of obstruction to be temporary. On average, a peak RV pressure of 128 mmHg before valvotomy is reduced to 51 mmHg shortly after valvotomy.K6 Completeness of relief of pulmonary stenosis can be determined only by late postoperative studies because of the usual, but not invariable, tendency for RV peak pressure to decrease over time after valvotomy.E2,G11 This decline is believed to be due primarily to regression of RV hypertrophy and lessening of infundibular narrowing.G9,K5,N3,R4 It is known, however, that adequate isolated pulmonary valvotomy does not invariably provide excellent relief of pulmonary stenosis, even in infants. Roos-Hesselink and colleagues report a low but definable incidence of restenosis.R11 In 64 patients with follow-up ranging from 22 to 33 years, the reintervention rate was 15%. Two patients required reoperation for recurrent RVOT obstruction at 2 and 3 years after initial surgery, and

Excision is often also necessary from the walls (anterior, medial, and lateral) for a short distance below ventriculotomy. *Continued*

two required subsequent balloon dilatation at 16 and 18 years postoperatively. Additionally, six other patients required surgical reintervention, ranging from 16 to 24 years postoperatively, for severe pulmonary regurgitation. Five of these six had a transanular patch placed at initial operation. Moderate to severe pulmonary regurgitation was present at late follow-up in 37% of patients.

Earing and colleagues, on the other hand, reported more concerning long-term reintervention.E1 In 53 patients with a mean follow-up of 33 years, reintervention for recurrent pulmonary stenosis was similarly low, but 21 patients (40%) required pulmonary valve replacement for severe regurgitation. This may reflect the extremely long follow-up, because other authors have recognized the progressive increase in symptomatic pulmonary regurgitation the longer the follow-up; however, equally important is that this cohort of patients underwent their original surgery in a different era. To this point, in this study, closed pulmonary valvotomy was importantly associated with need for late reoperation.

Hemodynamic results after percutaneous balloon valvotomy are similar to those just described (see Results in Section I). Fawzy and colleaguesF3 report a reduction in pulmonary valve gradient from 105 mmHg to 34 mmHg in their series of 90 patients (mean age 24 years). The infundibular gradient was large immediately following the procedure in 43 patients, all of whom underwent later recatheterization. The gradient decreased from 42 mmHg following the initial procedure to 13 mmHg at repeat study. Other reports document similar results.

Gudausky and BeekmanG12 summarize results from five large studies reported between 1994 and 2003. A total of 866 non-neonatal cases were included. Restenosis occurred in 20%, with 7% requiring repeat balloon valvotomy and 7% requiring surgery. Severe pulmonary insufficiency was present in 1%. Freedom from either surgical or balloon reintervention

at 5 and 10 years after intervention, reported by Rao and colleagues,R3 was 88% and 84%, respectively (Fig. 39-12).

#### Comparison of Surgery and Balloon Valvotomy

Peterson and colleagues studied comparative outcomes between surgical and balloon valvotomy.P2 Between 1969 and 2000, 62 patients underwent surgery, and 108 balloon valvotomy. Both techniques were effective, but there were differences at 10-year follow-up. Surgery reduced the gradient across the pulmonary valve more effectively than balloon valvotomy and had lower rates of restenosis and overall reintervention. Balloon valvotomy had a lower rate of moderate pulmonary regurgitation, which did not appear to influence reintervention rates in the two groups. Nevertheless, balloon valvotomy is today the procedure of choice because of its lower cost, shorter hospital stay, lower degree of invasiveness, and effectiveness. Based on the study of Earing and colleagues,E1 it can be inferred that the reintervention rate in the surgery group studied by Peterson and colleaguesP2 will continue to rise with longer follow-up as symptoms from pulmonary regurgitation develop.

#### Cyanosis

Cyanosis may persist late postoperatively when the foramen ovale or ASD is not closed, even when stenosis has been relieved, as a result of impaired RV compliance.D3,M5,O2 This can occur occasionally with a normally developed, severely hypertrophied RV, presumably secondary to diffuse fibrosis, but it is the rule in the hypoplastic RV. Data from Freed and colleagues suggest that the reversed atrial shunt may lessen as an infant or young child grows and as the RV increases in size, and later closure of the ASD thus may not be required.F3 This favorable sequence cannot be expected in patients with hypoplastic RV, and it is well known that important hypoxia can occur from a right-to-left shunt through a small atrial communication.

#### Morphologic Changes

The sinus portion of the RV enlarges and becomes normal in size in most patients. The infundibulum enlarges in many patients, but as in tetralogy of Fallot (see Chapter 38), a narrow pulmonary anulus may fail to enlarge as the child grows. The apparent size of the pulmonary arteries increases, and in most patients they become normal sized. Tricuspid regurgitation, even when severe preoperatively, is usually absent or mild late postoperatively.

#### Functional Capacity

Most patients have an excellent late functional result. Stone and colleagues have shown that during exercise, children who have undergone pulmonary valvotomy have a normal relationship between cardiac output and oxygen consumption, no increase in RV end-diastolic pressure (preoperatively it increased), and less increase than preoperatively in RV peak systolic pressure.S9

The late result in patients with a hypoplastic RV is inferior to that in patients with a normally developed ventricle. Late mortality is higher, there may be a reversed shunt through an unclosed atrial communication, and there may be residual infundibular obstruction. There may also be persistent or recurrent right heart failure despite complete relief of stenosis. Although there are no techniques proven to be beneficial in managing the hypoplastic RV, a number of options are available in selected cases. Late heart failure may be prevented in this group, particularly in those who are young, by a complete valvotomy combined with enlargement of the RV cavity by excision of trabeculations. This may be particularly helpful if extensive endocardial fibrosis is present. In patients with persistent RV failure, volume unloading by creating a bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis may be beneficial.

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

When patients first show signs and symptoms at age 1 month or more, they are usually less critically ill than those presenting as neonates. Nonetheless, when diagnosis of severe stenosis is made, pulmonary valvotomy is advisable. As in critical pulmonary stenosis in neonates, percutaneous balloon valvotomy is usually the intervention indicated.F4,O1,T1 Only in special circumstances is surgical intervention indicated. These include dysplastic valves, severely hypoplastic valves, severe infundibular stenosis, and associated intracardiac lesions requiring surgery.

Intervention is similarly advised in asymptomatic infants with severe stenosis. In those with moderate stenosis, intervention in infancy is debatable; it is not recommended when stenosis is mild. In older patients, management differs only in the group with moderate stenosis. In this subset, the older the age at diagnosis, the less likely there will be important progression and therefore less need for intervention.

In all patient groups beyond the neonatal period, a gradient across the pulmonary valve of 50 mmHg or greater is considered an indication for intervention. Presence and degree of RV hypoplasia are taken into account when deciding on intervention. Because of its effect in increasing cyanosis and heart failure, severe RV hypoplasia makes intervention more urgent in infants. In older children and adults presenting with this lesion, indications for intervention do not differ unless there is severe heart failure unresponsive to medical measures. Under these circumstances, risk of intervention is increased.

#### SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

#### Right Ventricular Hypoplasia in Children and Adults

When the RV is severely hypoplastic, symptoms and signs are substantially altered. Important symptoms are not necessarily present in infancy, but when they appear they tend to progress rapidly. Classically, there is a markedly prominent *a* wave and reversed (expiratory) splitting of the second heart sound.W2 Pulmonary stenosis with hypoplastic RV is associated with less than the expected degree of RV hypertrophy, and in severe hypoplasia, LV forces are dominant despite severe stenosis.E3 Diminished RV potentials are due to smallness of its cavity rather than to diminution in muscle mass.B6 Balloon valvotomy may not be as effective in this group because of (1) frequent presence of organic infundibular obstruction, (2) necessity of closing the atrial communication to abolish the otherwise persistent right-to-left shunt, and (3) probable benefits of enlarging the RV cavity by excising muscle from its sinus portion.W2 Taking all these factors into consideration, a surgical approach may be required. However, when severe heart failure is present, prognosis is still poor with any approach. In this setting, reducing volume load on the RV by performing a superior cavopulmonary anastomosis may be of benefit (see Special Situations and Controversies in Section III of Chapter 41).

#### Supravalvar Pulmonary Stenosis

The rarest form of pulmonary stenosis and intact ventricular septum is supravalvar pulmonary stenosis. It has been called *hourglass pulmonary stenosis* M4 and is characterized by narrowing of the sinutubular junction, similar to that seen in supravalvar aortic stenosis. This lesion, like pulmonary valve dysplasia, does not respond to balloon dilatationB1; surgery is required. Various technical approaches have been described, all similar to those described for supravalvar aortic stenosis (see Section III of Chapter 47). The technique of repair can involve patching from the main pulmonary artery across the sinutubular junction into the sinus of Valsalva. Alternatively, repair using only native pulmonary artery tissue has been described.B1

#### DEFINITION

Pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum is a congenital malformation in which the pulmonary valve is atretic and no ventricular septal defect exists. It coexists with variable degrees of right ventricular (RV) and tricuspid valve hypoplasia, and variable degrees of coronary artery abnormalities. This chapter discusses this malformation in the setting of atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial concordant connections.

#### HISTORICAL NOTE

In 1839, Peacock collected records of seven patients with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum and gave credit to John Hunter for reporting the first case in 1783.P4 Hunter described a premature male who died 13 days after birth. The RV had "scarcely any cavity," and the tricuspid valve was "especially small." Coronary sinusoids and RV– coronary artery fistulae were recognized by Grant in 1926 and later by others.G10,K1,L2,S10,W4 RV-dependent coronary circulation began to be recognized at least in 1975 by Essed and colleagues and more recently by others.B7,C1,E6,G7

In 1955, Greenwold and colleagues at Mayo Clinic described two types of RV in this malformation: (1) small and (2) normal-sized or large.G11,G12 Subsequently, the idea evolved that values for RV cavity size and tricuspid valve dimensions, as well as morphologic details, comprised a spectrum embracing virtually all values between the extremes.G4,Z2 Greenwold and colleagues also suggested that pulmonary valvotomy was appropriate treatment when the RV was near normal in size.G11,G12 In 1961, Davignon and colleagues at Mayo Clinic suggested that a systemic–pulmonary artery shunt be performed when the RV was small.D4 Reports of successful surgery from the University of Minnesota, Mayo Clinic, and Henry Ford Hospital appeared in 1961.B3,D4,Z1 The combination of a systemic–pulmonary artery shunt with an RV outflow operation was described by Bowman and colleagues in 1971 and by Trusler and colleagues in 1976.B8,T2 In 1993, Hanley and colleagues introduced the concept that optimal outcomes are best achieved when neonatal and subsequent surgical management are specifically tailored to the variable morphology of this malformation.H1

#### MORPHOLOGY

Hearts with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum include a spectrum extending from mild concomitant abnormalities of the RV and tricuspid valve to the most severe. Whether the entity of pulmonary stenosis and intact ventricular septum, particularly critical pulmonary stenosis in neonates, is part of this spectrum can be debated (see Section I of Chapter 39). Evidence supporting the continuum of these two entities is that at least some hearts at adjoining ends of the spectra have similar RV and tricuspid valvar abnormalities. It has been hypothesized that the later the narrowing of the pulmonary valve develops in fetal life, including progression to atresia, the more fully and normally developed are the tricuspid valve, RV cavity, and RV myocardium. Conversely, the earlier these developments occur in fetal life, the more likely that these structures will be hypoplastic and abnormal.A2,K3,T1 This hypothesis is also consistent with the concept that there is a continuity of the spectra of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum and pulmonary stenosis with intact ventricular septum.

#### Pulmonary Valve

The nature of the structure at the junction of the RV and pulmonary trunk is arguable. Van Praagh and colleagues imply that fibrous components are pulmonary valve remnants.V1 Others point out that in many cases, there is only poorly structured imperforate fibrous tissue overlying muscular atresia.A5,E1,Z2 In any event, commissural ridges may be prominent and converge to meet in the center of the "valve," an appearance similar to that in pulmonary valve stenosis.Z2 In some patients, commissural ridges are present only in the periphery, the center being a smooth fibrous membrane.B9 In the combined U.K.-Ireland multicenter study of 183 patients, 75% had membranous atresia and 25% muscular atresia.D1 Of greater importance is the nature of the structures immediately below the RV–pulmonary trunk junction (see "Right Ventricle" and "Tricuspid Valve" in text that follows).

Data from Hanley and colleagues.H1

Based on data from 171 neonates with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum in the Congenital Heart Surgeons Society study. Size of pulmonary arteries was known in 84.

Cavity size was graded (0, normal to −5, severe hypoplasia) based on echocardiographic and cineangiographic findings.

Five of six patients with moderate or severe hypoplasia of right and left pulmonary arteries on cineangiography had severely reduced right ventricular cavity size (information available for 84 of 136 patients).

*d* In addition, eight patients had enlarged right ventricular cavities, and one (12%) of these had moderately hypoplastic pulmonary arteries. Key: *RV,* Right ventricle.

#### Pulmonary Arteries

The pulmonary trunk is usually nearly normal in size, but uncommonly is severely hypoplastic.C3,C9,E1,E5,Z2 Rarely, the pulmonary trunk is represented only by a fibrous cord.V1

Right and left pulmonary arteries are usually normal in diameter or slightly hypoplastic.E3,V1 Uncommonly, they are moderately or severely hypoplastic, usually in patients with severely reduced RV cavity size (Table 40-1). Rarely, there are major arborization abnormalities of the native pulmonary arteries in association with large aortopulmonary collaterals. Four such patients have been encountered by F.L. Hanley and colleagues (personal communication, February 2012).

#### Right Ventricle

Size of the RV cavity is variable. In about 5% of patients, it is enlarged (see Chapter 38, Fig. 38-2 and Chapter 39, Table 39-1). Ebstein malformation and severe tricuspid regurgitation may coexist with the latter.A7,B8,C10,F8,M8,V3,Z2 Many individuals with this combination die in fetal life.A2 Rarely, the RV wall may be very thin (*Uhl anomaly* or *parchment right ventricle*C10) and the cavity nontrabeculated adjacent to the tricuspid valve and heavily trabeculated in its apical half.

Much more frequently, cavity size is reduced, severely so in about 60% of patients. This appears to be the result of massive wall hypertrophy extending into the ventricular cavity. Often, this completely obliterates the infundibular cavity, and the atresia can be termed *muscular* in such cases.B14 At times, the apical-trabecular cavity is completely obliterated; in the most extreme cases, both portions are obliterated. Although these cavities are obliterated, the respective portions of the RV are not absent. Cavity obliteration can be localized by echocardiography as well as by anatomic studies.M5 Cavity obliteration has been further characterized in the U.K.-Ireland multicenter study.D1 All three components of the RV (inlet, trabecular, and infundibular) were present in all cases, but with different degrees of cavity obliteration from muscular ingrowth.

to muscular obliteration of the infundibular and trabecular components was present in 8%. A "bipartite" ventricle due to muscular obliteration of the trabecular component alone was present in 34%. There were no cases of muscular obliteration of the infundibulum alone. A "tripartite" ventricle was present in the remaining 58%.

There is associated diffuse fibrosis of the hypertrophied muscle and, especially when the RV cavity is small, a modest degree of RV endocardial fibroelastosis. C8,E3,P3,Z2 Bulkley and colleagues found typical myocardial fiber disarray in 69% of the RV free wall and in 73% of the ventricular septum in this condition. B13 The potential for impaired left ventricular (LV) as well as RV dysfunction is evident.

#### Right Ventricular-Coronary Artery Fistulae

Coronary sinusoids, or dilated portions of the coronary microcirculation, can be detected by cineangiography in about half of patients C1,C9 (Table 40-2). In some cases, fistulous connections between the RV cavity and these sinusoids form multiple small communications into branches of left or right coronary arteries. E3,G10,L2,W4 Occasionally they converge into a single large vessel that empties into the left anterior descending or right coronary artery. In many cases, the fistulae are minor. In the multicenter U.K.-Ireland study, 58% of patients had completely normal coronary circulation, 15% had minor filling of the coronary arteries with RV injection at catheterization, and about 25% had major fistulae, with about one third of these having no coronary connection to the aorta. D1

Prevalence of RV–coronary arterial fistulae is inversely related to dimensions of the tricuspid valve (and hence of the RV cavity) (Fig. 40-1) and amount of tricuspid regurgitation. It is also directly related to RV systolic pressure. F4,H1,P2 However, the milieu for development of fistulae may be a consequence of genetically or developmentally induced myocardial abnormalities. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrate abnormal density and orientation of capillaries and myocyte disarray in the presence of fistulae. O4

**Figure 40-1** Nomogram of a regression equation (univariable) expressing the relation between dimensions of the tricuspid valve expressed as *z* value (see "Dimensions of Normal Cardiac and Great Artery Pathways" in Chapter 1) and probability of the presence of right ventricular–coronary artery fistulae in pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum. Key: *RV*, Right ventricle. (From Hanley and colleagues.<sup>H1</sup>)

Desaturated RV blood, although vital in the presence of proximal coronary obstructions, compromises myocardial oxygen supply in regions to which it is distributed by these fistulae. This may account in part for the myocardial abnormalities described later in this chapter. E3,O3,V1 Complexity of oxygen delivery to the myocardium is evidenced by the fact that the left anterior descending artery (or any coronary artery) may fill through these fistulae from the RV in systole, and from the aorta in the normal manner during diastole. For There results a spectrum of percentages of LV myocardium dependent on the RV for coronary perfusion, albeit desaturated; the percentage depends on location and severity of proximal coronary artery stenoses as well as on the fistulae. At some critical point, sufficient myocardium is in jeopardy of developing such severe ischemia when RV hypertension is relieved that RV decompression becomes contraindicated as a surgical option. In an analysis by Giglia and colleagues of 16 patients with coronary angiography and subsequent RV surgical decompression, 7 of 7 (100%; CL 77%-100%) with no coronary stenosis survived, 4 of 6 (67%; CL 39%-88%) with stenosis in one major coronary survived, and 0 of 3 (0%; CL 0%-46%) with stenosis in two major coronaries survived. G6

When less severe coronary abnormalities are present in association with fistulae, regional LV wall motion abnormalities are commonly identifiable before RV decompression, and they increase after decompression; however, severe global LV dysfunction is unusual. G2

In about 10% of patients (20% of those with RV–coronary fistulae), coronary circulation or some critical part of it is derived entirely or nearly so from the RV in the manner described, defining *RV-dependent coronary circulation*. This may occur because of development of arterial obstructions in the left main or right coronary arteries, or both, or in the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery (R.M. Freedom, personal communication, 1991). No correlates of RV dependence are known beyond those for RV–coronary artery fistulae. Proximal coronary arterial occlusions etiologic to the dependence may develop in fetal life; some develop or progress after birth. G7

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>a</sup>Based on data from 274 patients (two with unknown type of right ventricular outflow obstruction) in the Congenital Heart Surgeons Society study. <sup>b</sup>In this study, it was not possible to place each patient in the spectrum of right ventricular dependency (see text). The phrase "with RV dependence" describes patients in whom dependence was judged to be so extreme that decompression of the right ventricle would be fatal.

RV-dependent coronary circulation is a major consideration in planning therapy (see Indications for Operation later in this chapter). The difficulty is in deciding how much myocardium at risk is considered too much, triggering the management decision to avoid decompressing the hypertensive RV. To address this difficulty, Calder and colleagues identified coronary abnormalities in 116 patients.C2 They determined that presence of coronary fistulae alone did not correlate with mortality. The presence and extent of coronary interruptions, and the amount of LV myocardium that was RV dependent (determined with a 15-point scoring system), did correlate with mortality.

The problem, however, is even more complex than solely determining the amount of myocardium at risk, because even a small amount of extremely ischemic myocardium may be the source of a life-threatening dysrhythmia. Recently, LV coronary abnormalities unrelated to the presence of fistulae, sinusoids, or coronary interruptions have been discovered. Hwang and colleagues showed that patients with pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum, regardless of the presence of fistulae, have decreased density of intramyocardial arterioles relative to normal and hypertrophied hearts.H8

#### Tricuspid Valve

The tricuspid valve is usually abnormal in this malformation.A5,B14,F4 Occasionally the abnormality is simply small size, but usually the leaflets are thickened and the chordae are abnormal in number and attachment. Local agenesis and incomplete leaflet separation occur. The importance of these abnormalities has been emphasized by Davignon and colleagues and by Paul and Lev.D4,P3

In about 10% of neonates, *z* value of the tricuspid valve is less than −5, and in 50% it is −2.2 or less (Fig. 40-2). (See Appendix Fig. 40A-1 for a nomogram for estimating the *z* value of the tricuspid valve.) Dimensions of the tricuspid valve are well correlated with those of the RV cavity, in contrast to dimensions in neonates with critical pulmonary stenosis, in whom they are not correlated.B14,E3,E5,F4,Z2

**Figure 40-2** Relationship between diameter of the tricuspid valve (by echocardiography), expressed as *z* value, and size of the right ventricular cavity (grade estimated subjectively from echocardiographic and cineangiographic studies) in patients with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum (*n* = 71). (From Hanley and colleagues.H1)

In uncommon cases in which dimensions of the tricuspid valve are large, its leaflets usually show features of Ebstein malformation, with enlargement of the anterior leaflet and downward displacement onto the ventricle of the origin of a dysplastic septal leaflet. The posterior leaflet may or may not be abnormal.B4 These valves are usually severely regurgitant.B2 Another pathologic lesion of the tricuspid valve has been recognized in patients with dilated RV and severe tricuspid regurgitation—that of unguarded tricuspid orifice, in which the inferior (mural) leaflet is absent rather than displaced.A6

#### Right Atrium

The right atrium is enlarged, and it is more enlarged when there is severe tricuspid regurgitation. An interatrial communication is present in all cases, usually a patent foramen ovale of adequate size.E1 However, shortly after birth the foramen becomes restrictive in some patients. The eustachian valve is frequently prominent.

#### Left-Sided Chambers

The left atrium is usually hypertrophied and somewhat enlarged, and the mitral orifice is usually larger than normal. The LV shows some hypertrophy and endocardial fibroelastosis.C8 A convex bulging of the interventricular septum into the LV cavity has been noted, with some speculating that this might produce subaortic obstruction.Z2 Clinical and postmortem studies have demonstrated evidence of LV myocardial ischemia in virtually all patientsF10,H3; perhaps related to this, LV compliance is depressed in many.S9

#### Aorta

The aorta usually has adult morphology without isthmic narrowing and is usually left sided.M8

#### Ductus Arteriosus

The ductus arteriosus is patent at birth but has the usual tendency to close. Orientation of the ductus is typical for pulmonary atresia of all forms, with an obtuse proximal and acute distal angle at its aortic attachment. Usually the bronchial arteries are normal, and important aortopulmonary collateral arteries absent.E1

#### Coexisting Cardiac Anomalies

Other than Ebstein malformation, coexisting cardiac anomalies are uncommon.B11

#### CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

#### Symptoms and Signs

Fetal distress is usually not evident except in those with a large RV. Delivery is typically uncomplicated and at term.E5 The babies are generally well developed (Fig. 40-3) and are likely initially to appear healthy except for cyanosis.B3,B11 Cyanosis is usually obvious on the first day and becomes rapidly more severe as the ductus closes and there is respiratory distress and progressing metabolic acidosis.D8,G8 In the New England series, 81% of babies presented during the first week

Absence of an RV impulse in a cyanotic infant with a palpable LV should arouse suspicion of pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum, tricuspid atresia, Ebstein malformation, or critical pulmonary stenosis with hypoplastic RV. B5,P5 Typically, no murmur or a systolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation is heard, sometimes with a thrill. B3,B5,E1 Despite presence of a patent ductus arteriosus, a continuous murmur is seldom heard. C3,E1 The second heart sound is single. P5

Classic findings on chest radiography include clear lung fields with diminished (or normal) vascular markings and a flat or concave pulmonary trunk segment. Heart size is variable and may be large, even when the RV cavity is small.

#### Electrocardiography

P waves can be normal at birth, but evidence of right atrial enlargement develops quickly, and within a few weeks, prominent right atrial P waves are uniformly present. B3,C8,P5,S5 Mean

Note ventricular septum bulging into left ventricle (LV), indicating severe RV hypertension. Tricuspid valve (TV) anulus is small, about 50% of the diameter of the mitral valve (MV) anulus. A large atrial septal defect is present. **B**, Apical four-chamber view with color Doppler in systole, showing severe tricuspid valve regurgitation. Right atrium (RA) is markedly enlarged.

QRS axis in the frontal plane is usually normal or shows a rightward deviation, and the RV hypertrophy pattern usually present in the neonate is absent. C8,G1,M3,S7 However, electrocardiographic evidence of RV hypertrophy may be present even though the RV cavity is small, precluding its use to predict RV cavity size.

#### Echocardiography

Two-dimensional echocardiography is diagnostic (Fig. 40-5). Also, dimensions of the tricuspid valve, RV cavity size, and nature of the outflow obstruction (membranous or muscular) can be determined with confidence. Of importance is the fact that RV–coronary artery fistulae can be identified accurately by two-dimensional echocardiography with pulsed Doppler color flow ultrasound imaging \$52,V2 (Fig. 40-6). However,

echocardiographic evaluation is limited: fistula size, extent of fistula formation, and presence of proximal coronary arterial stenosis cannot as yet be accurately delineated.

Tricuspid valve *z* value can be highly predictive of RVdependent coronary circulation, indicating need for further angiographic evaluation.S4 Fetal echocardiography can identify the anomaly with reasonable accuracy,M1 but this does not appear to affect postnatal outcome favorably.D2 Nevertheless, the morphology determined at fetal echocardiographic evaluation can be used to predict postnatal outcome and thus can be employed as an important prenatal counseling tool.S1

#### Cardiac Catheterization and Cineangiography

When pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum is diagnosed by echocardiography, cardiac catheterization and angiography are indicated to search for coronary arterial stenoses, coronary sinusoids, and RV-coronary fistulae. If these are present, extent of LV myocardial dependence on the RV must be established.

Right atrial mean pressure is usually higher than left, and a prominent *a* wave can be seen on the pressure tracing.C3,C8 RV peak pressure is usually higher than or equal to systemic pressure, although it may be less in association with severe tricuspid regurgitation and a thin-walled RV.C3,D8,G4,J2,S7 Systemic arterial saturation is low, but varies according to flow through the patent ductus arteriosus. Size and configuration of the RV cavity can be displayed by RV angiography (Fig. 40-7). In Ebstein anomaly with severe tricuspid regurgitation presenting in the neonatal period in association with high pulmonary vascular resistance, RV systole may fail to open a normal pulmonary valve; high-quality angiography will prevent the mistaken diagnosis of pulmonary atresia.N3

Quantitative cineangiographic studies indicate reduced RV function in essentially all cases. LV function and enddiastolic volume are also abnormal unless a normal LV mass is present.S6

#### Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Computed Tomography Angiography

These imaging modalities are not typically used during the neonatal period. They may, however, be useful in evaluating older patients. Evaluation of cavity size and degree of musculature of the RV can be accurately determined using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging (Fig. 40-8). Delayedenhancement CMR can be used to determine the status of the myocardium as well (Fig. 40-9). Volume-rendered computed tomography (CT) angiography imaging can also accurately define abnormal coronary connections (Fig. 40-10).

### NATURAL HISTORY

Pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum is an uncommon malformation, occurring in 1% to 1.5% of individuals born with congenital heart disease.F6,M10 It was present in 3% of critically ill infants with congenital heart disease in the New England series.B11 It is highly lethal, with about 50% of individuals dying within 2 weeks of birth and about 85% by age 6 months (Fig. 40-11). Death is caused by severe hypoxia and metabolic acidosis and usually coincides with spontaneous closure of the ductus arteriosus. Rarely, patients survive into young adult life. McArthur and colleagues describe a 21-year-old whose pulmonary blood flow came from a right coronary–pulmonary arterial fistula, and Robicsek and colleagues describe another patient of similar age who survived because of a congenital aortopulmonary window.M6,R3

#### TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

#### Overview

No single neonatal operation is standard for pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum; rather, several surgical procedures, either in isolation or in combination, are indicated based on the details of the morphology in each caseH1 (see Indications for Operation later in this chapter for a description of the best initial operation for each morphologic variant). The initial operation most commonly indicated for

![](_page_16_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 40-7** Cineangiograms in neonates with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum. **A,** Right ventriculogram, frontal view. Small right ventricle (RV) has smooth borders, infundibular cavity is obliterated, and tricuspid valve shows severe regurgitation. **B,** Right ventriculogram from another patient in *(B1)* frontal and *(B2)* lateral views. The RV is very small, but its walls are trabeculated. Sinusoid channels are connected with coronary circulation. **C,** Left ventriculogram in frontal view in another patient. The left ventricle (LV) has its usual appearance and supports the aorta. A right Blalock-Taussig shunt has been made. Key: *AO,* Aorta; *IVC,* inferior vena cava; *RA,* right atrium; *RPA,* right pulmonary artery; *RSA,* right subclavian artery; *SVC,* superior vena cava.

this entity is concomitant transanular patching, systemic– pulmonary artery shunting, and ductal ligation. The next most common procedure is an isolated systemic-to– pulmonary artery shunt and ductal ligation.

For all of the procedures described, postnatal preoperative management is similar. Following birth, an arterial pressure monitoring catheter is placed, preferably into the left radial artery. (A right radial artery catheter should be avoided because of the possibility that a systemic-to–pulmonary artery shunt originating from the right subclavian artery will be part of the surgical procedure.) A reliable intravenous line is placed into either the femoral or umbilical vein. In general, deep intravenous lines into the upper body, such as into the subclavian or jugular veins, should be avoided to minimize thrombosis in the upper body venous system, because many patients will ultimately require a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt as part of their overall surgical management. A prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) infusion is started as soon as possible to maintain ductal patency and is continued until after the surgical procedure.C4,C7,E4,F3,H4,N2,O2 The full dose is 0.1 mg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ; when the ductus is confirmed to be open, the dose often can be reduced.

Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are usually necessary, either as part of general resuscitative measures, or as a result of inhibition of intrinsic ventilatory drive due to PGE1. A low inspired oxygen fraction and controlled hypercarbia are used to counter the tendency for overcirculation through the ductus arteriosus. Low-dose inotropic support with dopamine or milrinone may be needed to support the systemic circulation.

#### Concomitant Placement of Transanular Patch and Systemic–Pulmonary Artery Shunt

A median sternotomy is made through an incision that is carried a little farther into the neck than usual to provide better exposure of the brachiocephalic trunk and subclavian arteries. After the pericardium is opened and stay sutures applied, the right pulmonary artery between the aorta and superior vena cava is dissected.

A 3.5-mm expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tube (3.0 mm if the neonate is smaller than about 2.5 kg) is cut to proper length. Without giving heparin at this time, a fine

![](_page_18_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 40-12** Technique of surgical pulmonary valvotomy for pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum. Median sternotomy is used. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with single venous cannulation, at normothermic or mild hypothermic temperature, is initiated. The ductus arteriosus is ligated (not shown). Aortic clamping is not performed. After CPB is established, the valve is exposed through a longitudinal incision in the pulmonary trunk. Fused commissures of the valve are identified. Using a knife with a #15 blade, the commissures are incised precisely along the fusion point between leaflets, beginning centrally and moving to the anulus. Arteriotomy is closed either primarily or with a narrow glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardial patch, using 7-0 polypropylene running suture.

side-biting clamp is placed to exclude the brachiocephalic trunk–subclavian artery junction, and an incision is made in the anterolateral aspect of the arterial wall. An end-to-side anastomosis is made between one end of the expanded PTFE graft and the artery, using 7-0 polypropylene suture. A clamp is placed as far medially on the right pulmonary artery as possible, and another as far laterally as possible but medial to the superior vena cava, and the pulmonary artery is opened longitudinally between them. Alternatively, a single fine sidebiting (C) clamp is used. Great care is taken to ensure the clamp does not interfere with ductal flow to the left pulmonary artery or cause coronary artery compression at the aortic origin. The distal end of the expanded PTFE tube is anastomosed to this opening. Clamps are removed.

The ductus arteriosus is dissected and ligated. The pulmonary trunk is dissected minimally. A piece of pericardium is removed, treated with glutaraldehyde, and cut to proper dimensions (see "Decision and Technique for Transanular Patching" under Technique of Operation in Section I of Chapter 38). The usual aortic cannula is employed, and a single venous cannula is positioned (see "One Versus Two Venous Cannulae" under Special Situations and Controversies in Section III of Chapter 2).

Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is established, with the perfusate warm and normocalcemic. The neonate's temperature is maintained at approximately 34°C during CPB. The surgically created shunt is temporarily occluded by placing a vascular clamp on the PTFE tube. The operation may be done with the heart beating, or cold cardioplegia and controlled reperfusion may be used (see "Cold Cardioplegia, Controlled Aortic Root Reperfusion, and [When Needed] Warm Cardioplegic Induction" in Chapter 3).

A longitudinal incision is made in the pulmonary trunk, and the cartilaginous valve plate is incised. The incision is carried proximally onto the RV, taking care to find and stay in the cavity of the infundibulum and to extend it to the sinus portion and distally along the pulmonary trunk, stopping just before the bifurcation. The patch, preferably made from glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium, is sewn into place with 7-0 polypropylene continuous suture. The suture line does not include the full thickness of the incised RV wall, but rather incorporates the epicardium and about 30% of the outer thickness of the RV wall. The foramen ovale must not be closed.

The aortic clamp is released (or controlled reperfusion accomplished), and preparations are made for discontinuing CPB. The vascular clamp is removed from the PTFE tube, and when normothermia is regained, CPB is discontinued and the remainder of the operation completed as usual.

#### Other Initial Operations

Other initial operations are indicated based on specific morphology. These include isolated placement of a systemic to pulmonary artery shunt and ductal ligation; isolated placement of a transanular patch and ductal ligation using CPB; pulmonary valvotomy, placement of a systemic-to– pulmonary artery shunt, and ductal ligation using CPB; and isolated pulmonary valvotomy and ductal ligation using CPB (Fig. 40-12).

#### SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Postoperative care is the same as described under "Special Features of Postoperative Care" in Chapter 39 for critical pulmonary stenosis in neonates. As in the case with pulmonary stenosis, need for an additional surgical procedure is continually assessed.

#### RESULTS

#### Survival

#### *Early (Hospital) Death*

Overall hospital mortality of a heterogeneous group of neonates with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum, virtually all of whom have had one or more procedures, has been about 20%.H1 However, the hazard function for death does not level off appreciably until 3 to 6 months (Fig. 40-13). This plus the wide variability of morphology and of procedures makes the unadjusted figure of little value. More recent studies that have followed, in general, the guidelines described under Indications for Operation (see later) show improved early survival. In one study,J1 there was 1 hospital death among 47 patients (2.1%; CL 0.4%-6.8%), and in another,H5 5 early deaths among 44 patients (11%; CL

6.7%-18%). A 40-year single-institution study of 210 patients also documents that survival has improved over time.  $^{\rm D10}$ 

#### Time-Related Survival

Only about 60% of a heterogeneous group of neonates with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum were alive 1 year after entrance into the hospital for treatment, as were 60% at 2 years and 58% at 4 years. H1 The hazard function for death remains high but declining for the first 3 months, but after about 36 months it is only a little higher than that of an age-sex-race—matched general population. Patients with an abnormally large RV, with or without Ebstein malformation, have a particularly poor outlook regardless of treatment; about 85% die within the first year. H1,H5 Excluding this small group of patients, 1-month, 1-year, and 4-year survival has been somewhat better than in the heterogeneous group (see Fig. 40-13). Some recent single-institution reports suggest slightly better long-term outcome. H5,O1,R6,Y1

Data from Hanley and colleagues.<sup>H1</sup>

<sup>a</sup>Based on 171 neonates with pulmonary atresia in the Congenital Heart Surgeons Society study (1987-1991). Excluded were patients with Ebstein malformation or right ventricular cavity size greater than normal (n=13, 11 of whom died) and those having no procedure (8, among whom 7 died; 3 are among the 13 just mentioned), leaving 153 neonates who actually underwent a procedure. Time zero was time of first intervention. <sup>b</sup>Coefficients, their standard deviation, and other details of the multivariable equation resulting from the analysis are in cited article. <sup>HI</sup> Key: *RV*, Right ventricle.

#### Modes of Death

The most common modes of death are acute heart failure and hypoxia.

#### Incremental Risk Factors for Premature Death

Survival after different initial procedures has varied widely (Fig. 40-14), but prevalence of small tricuspid valves and RV cavities has varied among the procedure groups. A more reliable understanding of the patient-specific and procedural risk factors for death is obtained by multivariable analysis (Table 40-3); validation of the analysis is shown in Appendix Fig. 40B-1.

Values for other variables entered into equation are birth weight 3.1 kg, right ventricular (RV)-dependent circulation, number, and in the case of a shunt operation, date of operation 1991. This nomogram is a rational basis for therapy. (From Hanley and colleagues.<sup>H1</sup>)

Value entered for birth weight is 3.1 kg. (From Hanley and colleagues.<sup>H1</sup>)

#### Dimensions of Tricuspid Valve

Small size (z value of diameter) of the tricuspid valve is a strong risk factor for death (Fig. 40-15). An exception is the case of neonates in whom the initial procedure is a systemic–pulmonary artery shunt alone. When that procedure is used, survival is unrelated to dimension of the tricuspid valve (see Fig. 40-15). Survival after shunting appears to have improved recently, probably related to increased experience with making systemic–pulmonary artery shunts in neonates (Fig. 40-16). The recent two-center study by Fenton and colleagues is relevant to this discussion. F2 They assessed survival among 35 patients who underwent a shunt-alone initial procedure. Although they did not measure tricuspid valve diameter, they evaluated RV cavity size, which is known to correlate with tricuspid valve size. Early mortality was low and

unrelated to RV size. Interestingly, however, they demonstrated that interim mortality (defined as occurring after successful neonatal surgery but before the second-stage operation) was substantial: 15%. Furthermore, when they evaluated only patients with very small RV cavities, interim mortality was 24%.

#### Right Ventricular–Dependent Coronary Circulation

An RV-dependent coronary circulation is a powerful risk factor for death. C2,C9,H5 In a study among 12 such patients, only 4 (CL 18%-52%) survived 1 or more years. H1 There is evidence, however, that even this powerful risk factor has recently been neutralized to some extent (see Fig. 40-16). In a 2006 study focusing only on patients with RV-dependent coronary circulation, overall mortality was 19%. G13 All patients were managed as neonates with a systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt only; all deaths occurred within 3 months of the procedure. Notably, all three patients with no coronary-to-aorta connection died. All surviving patients have gone on to a bidirectional cavopulmonary connection or Fontan without further mortality. In another recent study, 2 of 5 patients (CL 14%-71%) with RV-dependent coronary circulation died.

The severity of coronary abnormalities and fistulae affect more than survival; they are also associated with reduced LV function at late follow-up. D10

#### Systemic-Pulmonary Artery Shunt

In the past, systemic–pulmonary artery shunting alone has been associated with lower overall survival than when other procedures were used (see Fig. 40-14). More recently, survival with a shunt alone has improved strikingly (see Fig. 40-16). This is the only procedure associated with reasonable survival in patients with very small tricuspid valves.

#### Birth Weight

As in nearly all types of congenital heart disease requiring treatment early in life, low birth weight is an important risk factor for death.<sup>14</sup>

#### Interim Interventions after Initial Procedure

This section discusses further interim interventions performed before the definitive intervention leading to a separated two-ventricle system or a single-ventricle Fontan system. Patients whose initial procedure is a transanular patch and a systemic–pulmonary artery shunt generally do not require further interim procedures. This is an important advantage of this operation as the initial procedure. With it, the opportunity for maximal RV (and tricuspid valve) growth exists during the critical early weeks and months of life when myocardial hyperplasia is possible.

Among patients whose initial procedure is pulmonary valvotomy or placement of a transanular patch without a concomitant systemic–pulmonary artery shunt, about half require a systemic-pulmonary shunt within a few weeks (Fig. 40-17). The smaller the dimensions of the tricuspid valve, the greater the probability that a subsequent systemic–pulmonary artery shunt will be needed (P = .04) (Fig. 40-18).

Patients whose initial procedure is a pulmonary valvotomy with or without a concomitant shunt often subsequently require placement of a transanular patch (Fig. 40-19). No correlates with subsequent placement of such a patch have been identified. This suggests that a transanular patch should

be incorporated into the initial procedure whenever there is doubt about adequacy of the pathway through the infundibular portion of the RV.

Patients who initially have only a systemic–pulmonary artery shunt should be a select group characterized by marked hypoplasia of the tricuspid valve and RV, or RV-dependent coronary artery circulation (see Indications for Operation later). The goal is survival to age 3 to 6 months, when a bidirectional superior cavopulmonary shunt can be performed, eventually followed by a Fontan operation (see Indications for Operation in Chapter 41). About 85% of patients who receive an initial systemic–pulmonary artery shunt only appear to be able to achieve the goal of a Fontan operation. <sup>H1</sup>

(Format is as in Fig. 40-13.) Patients with Ebstein malformation, right ventricular cavity size greater than normal, or both were not included in this analysis. Multivariable analysis identified no risk factors for this event. (From Hanley and colleagues. H1)

#### **Definitive Procedures**

It is not possible at present to know the prevalence of achieving (at some time) a separated two-ventricle repair. It appears to be about 60% to 70% in patients with a tricuspid valve z value of -2 or greater, and less than 10% in those with very small z values. H1

Theoretically, in all patients in whom a separated two-ventricle repair cannot be accomplished, a single-ventricle Fontan system should eventually be achievable. The limiting factor in this group is survival to the time of a Fontan operation. Thus, the problem is analogous to that in patients with hypoplastic left heart physiology. Results of the Fontan operation in patients with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum appear to be the same as in patients with other congenital cardiac anomalies. M2,N1 Patients with severe coronary abnormalities may, however, be at increased late risk. P6

A more difficult question is whether all patients not able to achieve a two-ventricle repair *should* eventually undergo a Fontan, or whether an alternative procedure should serve as the definitive operation in selected patients. For example, certain patients with tricuspid valve z values that are moderately small may best be served by a definitive operation consisting of a bidirectional superior cavopulmonary shunt combined with closure of the atrial septal defect and a procedure creating unobstructed RV to pulmonary artery flow, the so-called one-and-a-half ventricle repair B4,C5,G3,K2,M12,M15 (see Special Situations and Controversies). In patients in whom the tricuspid valve and RV are functional, procedures may occasionally be necessary to correct tricuspid valve regurgitation. R1

#### Other Outcomes

Myocardial perfusion has been shown to be abnormal at midto late follow-up. E2 The abnormalities are not restricted to patients with identified coronary fistulae, but include patients with apparently normal coronary arteries. Exercise capacity is reduced in all patients with pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum, regardless of the definitive procedure.N4,S3 Late follow-up also demonstrates progressive right atrial dilatation, indicating abnormalities of the RV and tricuspid valve, and a tendency to develop arrhythmias.M9

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Presence of the malformation is generally an indication for operation because of its high lethality. As soon as the diagnosis is suspected, the neonate is resuscitated and stabilized, as described under Technique of Operation. Once the diagnosis is established and the baby is stabilized and in good condition, operation is undertaken, but in view of the favorable effect of PGE1, it is not done as an emergency.

Selection of the initial intervention is based in large part on the estimated probability that a separated two-ventricle system will ultimately be possible.B6,C6,D5 Indications given in this section are based on the work of de Leval and colleagues and on the findings of the Congenital Heart Surgeons Society studyD5,H1 (see Table 40-3 and Figs. 40-15 to 40-19). These two studies are entirely consistent with each other, as are those of other recent studies.A1,A4,B6,C6,C9

The inference from all available information is that the best guide to the type of initial operation is size of the tricuspid valve. A *z* value equal to or less than −4 (and by implication a very small RV chamber) makes probability of death after placement of a transanular patch with a concomitant shunt greater than after a systemic–pulmonary artery shunt alone (see Fig. 40-15). Furthermore, an achieved separated twoventricle system has been extremely uncommon when the original *z* value of the tricuspid valve has been less than −3.H1 (This line of reasoning could be altered were it to be shown that growth of the hypoplastic tricuspid valve could be made disproportionally greater than that of the body as a whole.) Thus, in patients with pulmonary atresia and a *z* value of the tricuspid valve equal to or less than −4, an initial systemic– pulmonary artery shunt is indicated.

At age 3 to 6 months, a bidirectional superior cavopulmonary shunt is performed, followed by a Fontan operation (see Indications for Operation in Chapter 41). So long as a total cavopulmonary type of connection is used for the Fontan procedure, nothing need be done to the tricuspid valve. Any evident RV–coronary artery fistula should be closed, unless there is RV-dependent coronary circulation. When the *z* value of the tricuspid valve is greater than −4, the inference is that risk of death will be no greater (see Fig. 40-15), and probability of a separated two-ventricle system greater, when a transanular patch is placed (or, in special circumstances, a pulmonary valvotomy performed) and a concomitant shunt is placed rather than a systemic–pulmonary artery shunt alone.

Ideally, some objective method of determining need for a transanular patch should be available, but the decision must rest on the subjectively evaluated "adequacy" of the infundibular cavity, the "anulus," and the pulmonary valve tissue itself. In the absence of any clear evidence of a substantial advantage of valvotomy in this setting, and because about 40% of those in whom a valvotomy has been done have required a subsequent transanular patch, a transanular patch should be used whenever doubt arises.H1

When an RV outflow operation is being performed as described, need for a concomitant systemic–pulmonary artery shunt is moderately related to RV cavity size and thus to dimension of the tricuspid valve (see Fig. 40-18). As a general guide, a concomitant systemic–pulmonary artery shunt should be performed, especially when the *z* value of the tricuspid valve is less than about −2 (indicating a small RV cavity).

When the initial procedure has been done under the hypothesis that a separated two-ventricle system will be possible, testing of that hypothesis should begin 6 to 12 months after the initial procedure. The shunt is temporarily occluded, ideally percutaneously. If arterial oxygen saturation remains high, the shunt is permanently closed by percutaneous or surgical techniques (for percutaneous technique, see "Percutaneous Closure of Large Aortopulmonary Collateral Arteries" under Special Situations and Controversies in Section II of Chapter 38). The atrial septal defect is temporarily occluded, again ideally by percutaneous techniques. If right atrial pressure remains below 12 to 15 mmHg, cardiac output is adequate, and oxygen saturation of blood in the right atrium is maintained (any decrease in cardiac output is compensated for by rise in arterial oxygen saturation), the defect should be closed permanently by a surgical or percutaneous technique (see "Closure of Atrial Septal Defects by Percutaneous Techniques" under Special Situations and Controversies in Chapter 30).B1

When the patient does not tolerate shunt closure, a separated two-ventricle system may not be possible, and consideration should be given to beginning the process leading to a Fontan operation or some other definitive procedure, such as the "one-and-a-half ventricle" repair as discussed earlier under "Definitive Procedures." When closure of the atrial septal defect is not well tolerated, a prolonged period of procrastination may be wise if the patient's clinical state is good.

Neonates with RV-dependent coronary circulation represent a special problem (see "Right Ventricular–Coronary Artery Fistulae" earlier under Morphology). When after detailed study, a considerable portion of the LV myocardium is judged to be in jeopardy of developing severe ischemia, decompression or thrombolytic exclusion of the RV is contraindicated.C9 The recent study by CalderC2 provides quantitative information on the amount of LV myocardium at risk of ischemia and how it relates to outcome. These patients may be treated the same as other patients with severely hypoplastic tricuspid valves and RVs, so long as the type of Fontan operation allows fully saturated blood to enter the RV. In time, cardiac transplantation may prove the optimal treatment for this small subset of patients.

#### SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

#### Percutaneous Valvotomy

It has been recognized for some time that percutaneous techniques could become the initial procedure for neonates in whom the pathway through the infundibulum is reasonably wide and the atresia "membranous." In 1991, this was achieved successfully by laser valvotomy followed by balloon dilatation.P1 Other reports have followed, with mixed outcome.B12,F1,G5,G9,O4,R4,W2

Shinebourne and colleagues recommend percutaneous valvotomy in all cases of membranous atresia with an RV and tricuspid valve that have the potential for a biventricular repair. Even in this favorable subgroup, 60% will remain duct dependent and require a systemic-to–pulmonary artery shunt. Se Similarly, Humpl and colleagues attempted percutaneous valvotomy in a highly selected subgroup. Ho Gr 30 patients, the valve could not be perforated in 3 (10%; CL 4.6%-19%), 14 required a shunt (47%; CL 36%-57%), and 4 (13%; CL 7.1%-23%) required RV outflow surgery. Thus, more than two thirds of the group required surgical intervention. In the study by Hirata and colleagues, only 2 of 17 patients (12%; CL 4.2%-25%) undergoing percutaneous valvotomy did not require an additional neonatal surgical procedure involving either a shunt or the RV outflow tract. Similar outcomes were observed by McLean and Pearl. Mo

In the U.K.-Ireland multicenter study, neonates undergoing percutaneous valvotomy had an increased risk of reintervention to increase pulmonary blood flow relative to those undergoing initial surgery. Thus, this method has the same limitations as surgical valvotomy or transanular patching without a concomitant shunt—particularly the potential delay of weeks or months in maximizing the stimulus to RV growth—and is associated with a higher likelihood of reintervention than these initial surgical procedures (see "Interim Interventions after Initial Procedure" earlier under Results).

#### Formalin Infiltration of Ductus Arteriosus

In 1975, Rudolph and colleagues introduced formalin infiltration of the wall of the ductus via a left thoracotomy as a means of maintaining patency and avoiding need for an artificial shunt. The carefully selected patients with favorable anatomy, this technique may provide outcome similar to that of surgical intervention. The observed ductal closure within a few weeks or months of the procedures, and its use is not currently recommended. The observed ductal closure within a few weeks or months of the procedures, and its use is not currently recommended.

#### Right Ventricle-to-Aorta Conduit

Use of an RV-to-aorta conduit for patients with RV-dependent coronary circulation has been used by several groups to limit myocardial ischemia. F9,L1 Although outcomes have been good, the extremely limited use of this procedure prevents adequate assessment of its effectiveness.

### Tricuspid Valve Closure in the Presence of Right Ventricular–Coronary Fistulae

Several groups advocate closing the tricuspid valve orifice in the setting of RV-coronary fistulae without major coronary abnormalities. W1,W5 Limited experience prevents adequate analysis of this procedure.

#### Tricuspid Valve Growth

The tricuspid valve and RV cavity tend under some circumstances to increase in size as the patient grows. <sup>G9,L5,M4,M13,S11</sup> However, there is little evidence that *disproportionate* enlargement occurs as growth of the child proceeds, no matter what the surgical procedure. The only evidence for disproportionate growth comes from a recent study by Huang and colleagues of 40 patients undergoing initial neonatal surgical pulmonary valvotomy and shunt. <sup>H6</sup> They showed that on average, there was no change in tricuspid valve *z* value over time; however, on an individual patient basis, 32%

showed tricuspid valve enlargement of at least +2 z values at follow-up.

There is evidence that the RV cavity increases in size, but this may result from iatrogenic pulmonary or tricuspid regurgitation or both (Fig. 40-20). The tricuspid valve appears to grow *proportionally* with the child when there is forward flow across the tricuspid and pulmonary valves, but not otherwise D6,H2,L3 (Fig. 40-21). With growth of the RV, right ventricular–coronary artery fistulae may disappear. However, important abnormalities of RV compliance usually remain. Thus, there is at present no basis for determining treatment on anything other than z value of the tricuspid valve before initial therapy.

### Bidirectional Cavopulmonary Shunt in Right Ventricular–Dependent Coronary Circulation

It is widely acknowledged that the blood entering the RV (and thus perfusing the coronary circulation) following a total cavopulmonary connection type of Fontan in patients with RV-dependent coronary circulation will be fully or almost fully saturated. Miyaji and colleagues recently have shown that the blood entering the RV after a superior cavopulmonary shunt ("bidirectional Glenn") is also more saturated than that under conditions of a systemic-to–pulmonary shunt. This raises the question of whether there is value

in performing an early superior cavopulmonary shunt in patients with RV-dependent coronary circulation.

#### Right Ventricular Sinus Myectomy

Because it is well accepted that the RV in this malformation is intrinsically tripartite and only becomes bipartite or unipartite from muscular ingrowth and cavity obliteration, it is logical to infer that removal of the excess muscle may have therapeutic value in selected cases. Bryant and colleagues studied this in 16 patients. They concluded that the procedure leads to an immediate increase in RV volume and is associated with achievement of a biventricular repair in 87% of selected patients. Of concern, they also noted that tricuspid valve growth in relation to somatic growth was minimal, potentially limiting long-term success of this procedure.

### Assessment of Functional Benefit of Biventricular Versus Univentricular Definitive Procedures

Evidence supporting the generally held view that a biventricular repair is superior to a Fontan is limited at best. Redington and colleagues showed that a biventricular repair in patients with this malformation had restrictive RV physiology, with antegrade flow across the pulmonary valve during atrial contraction. This implies limited functional capacity. Exercise capacity was assessed by Sanghavi and colleagues and found to be similar in patients with biventricular repair and Fontan. Patients in both groups had subnormal peak  $\dot{V}o_2$ , with increasing impairment associated with increasing age. Based on these findings, it is not surprising that Numata and colleagues were unable to demonstrate a benefit in exercise capacity of the so-called one-and-a-half ventricle repair over the Fontan.

## Validation of Multivariable Analysis

Patients with Ebstein malformation, right ventricular cavity size greater than normal, or both were not included in this analysis. Symbols represent nonparametric survival estimates, and vertical bars represent confidence limits for each of the three major treatment groups. Solid lines indicate parametrically estimated survival, and dashed lines enclose their 70% confidence limits, which are obtained by averaging parametric estimates for each patient within each group (see "Parametric Hazard Function Regression" in Section IV of Chapter 6). Note close correspondence of average parametric estimate to nonparametric estimate. (From Hanley and colleagues. H1)
