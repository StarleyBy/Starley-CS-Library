#### DEFINITION

Ebstein anomaly is a congenital defect of the tricuspid valve in which origins of the septal or posterior leaflets or both are displaced downward into the right ventricle, and the leaflets are variably deformed. Characteristically, the anterior leaflet is enlarged and "sail-like." There is a wide spectrum of severity; in the mildest asymptomatic forms, the valve may appear normal at first sight, and classification as Ebstein anomaly may be debatable.S7

This chapter discusses Ebstein anomaly in hearts with atrioventricular concordant connection and without other major cardiac anomalies. Ebstein-type tricuspid atresia and Ebstein anomaly associated with pulmonary atresia and with atrioventricular discordant connection are discussed elsewhere (see Chapters 40, 41, and 55). Details of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, which is occasionally associated with Ebstein anomaly, are presented in Chapter 16.

## HISTORICAL NOTE

Wilhelm Ebstein's scholarly description of the tricuspid valve abnormality bearing his name was published in 1866.E1 His report describes a single autopsy specimen and includes a hypothesis of pathophysiology based on correlation of the morphology with clinical notes on the deeply cyanosed patient supplied by a colleague (Ebstein did not apparently

Data from GLH group.

Dilatation of the functional ventricle was present in 15, of the atrialized chamber in 4, and of the tricuspid anulus in 12. There was an atrial communication in all specimens (small probe-patent foramen ovale in 2, an enlarged foramen ovale in 7, and fossa ovalis atrial septal defect in 7). *b* In two hearts, the whole cusp was adherent.

see the patient, Joseph Prescher, alive).A7,S4 According to the historical review by Mann and Lie, the second case was not described until 20 years later, and the first description in the English literature was by MacCallum in 1900.M4 The eponym *Ebstein's disease* was first suggested by Arnstein in 1927 and was used by Yater and Shapiro in their 1937 review article that reported the sixteenth case and the first to be examined by both radiography and electrocardiography.A8,Y1 These investigators commented that "it would appear impossible to make the diagnosis during life." In 1950, Engle and colleagues as well as Reynolds suggested that the disease was associated with a clinical syndrome that should make diagnosis possible.E3,R6 In 1951, Van Lingen and colleagues and Soloff and colleagues made the diagnosis during life using cardiac catheterization and angiography, respectively.S17,V3 In 1955, Lev and colleagues described a patient with coexisting Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and provided histologic details of the course of the conducting tissue in this anomaly.L2

Palliative surgery was attempted unsuccessfully using a Blalock-Taussig shunt in 1950.E2 A superior vena cava–to– right pulmonary artery anastomosis (Glenn procedureG6) was used successfully by Gasul and colleagues in 1959 and subsequently by McCredie and colleagues and Scott and colleagues.G1,G2,M9,S6 Barnard and Schrire were the first to report the use of prosthetic valve replacement in 1962, followed by Cartwright and colleagues and Lillehei and colleagues.B3,C4,L4 Hardy and colleagues reported the first successful valvuloplasty in 1964 based on the concepts of Hunter and Lillehei.H1,H5 A similar technique was used by Bahnson in 1965.B1

#### MORPHOLOGY AND MORPHOGENESIS

#### Tricuspid Valve

Both the origin of the tricuspid valve from the atrioventricular (AV) ring and its chordal attachments within the right ventricle (RV) are malpositioned, and the leaflets are malformed.A4,A6,B4,L3,S5,Z1 The leaflets are either enlarged or reduced in size and are frequently dysplastic (thickened and distorted). These deformities vary widely in severity (Table 42-1). In the mildest forms, the valve is functionally near normalP3; in the fully developed syndrome, function is severely compromised. Displacement of the origin of the leaflets from the AV ring is reasonably constant. The septal leaflet appears always to be affected, the posterior leaflet nearly always, and the anterior leaflet seldom (Fig. 42-1). As noted by Anderson and colleagues, when both the septal and posterior leaflets are displaced,A6 the point of maximum displacement is usually at the commissure between them. Thus, the functional tricuspid anulus is rotated apically and anteriorly (Fig. 42-2). In the few cases in which the anterior leaflet is displaced, the commissural area between it and the septal leaflet, attached to the right trigone at the point of penetration of the bundle of His, remains in normal positionL2 (see Fig. 42-1). In many patients, the apparent displacement is due to adherence of the base of the leaflet to the RV wall (see Table 42-1 and Fig. 42-1). Adherence of leaflet tissue to the underlying myocardium is thought to represent a failure of delamination during development.K1 This failure effectively moves the hinge points of the septal and posterior leaflets (the functional anulus) into the ventricular cavity. When adherence is incomplete, there is a potential or obvious pocket beneath the leaflet.

The septal or posterior leaflet may be partially absent, in which case the belly of the leaflet is small or absent (see Fig. 42-1). The posterior leaflet is more often elongated than reduced in size (see Table 42-1), due in part to lack of a commissure between the posterior and anterior cusps. This was the case in 8 of 15 hearts examined at autopsy at GLH. The septal–posterior leaflet commissure may also occasionally be absent. Leaflet enlargement and elongation are characteristic of the anterior leaflet, which has been described as sail-like. The leaflet is usually diffusely thickened or ridged and occasionally consists partly of muscle. All the leaflets are frequently dysplastic, and isolated accessory leaflets may occur.L3

Distal leaflet attachments are variable and usually abnormal. Displaced and dysplastic posterior and septal leaflets frequently have multiple short chordae connecting to multiple small papillary muscles (see Fig. 42-1). The sail-like anterior leaflet may also have multiple short chordae arising around most of its free edge, binding it relatively closely to the septum and occasionally to the free wall, or the leaflet edge may be directly adherent to the anterior papillary muscle and moderator band or the posterior edge of the septal band.Z1 Presence of a free anterior leaflet is an important morphologic detail, because it greatly increases the likelihood of a successful repair. Leaflet fenestrations are common, with the opening typically guarded by a single papillary muscle, which gives rise to chords that attach to the periphery of the fenestration.

If the entire free margin of the leaflets is adherent and imperforate, one variety of tricuspid atresia is produced (see Chapter 41).R3,Z1 When the adherence is partial, the large

In three hearts, up to half the leaflet was missing.

In three hearts, the elongation was slight.

**Figure 42-1** Autopsy specimens of Ebstein anomaly with varying degrees of tricuspid valve deformity. Right atrium and right ventricle have been opened. **A,** Site of true atrioventricular ring is marked by dashed line between arrows. All three leaflets are enlarged and elongated (anterior leaflet is poorly displayed). Septal leaflet is completely adherent to ventricular septal surface and has abnormal distal chordal attachments, as does posterior leaflet. Note normal leaflet origin at right trigone (anteroseptal commissure). **B,** Septal leaflet origin is displaced well downward into ventricle, and leaflet tissue is diminutive and dysplastic. Posterior leaflet is adherent from the ring to point marked with large asterisk. Anterior leaflet origin is normal, its belly is mildly elongated and cleft, and there are multiple short chordal attachments. *Continued*

anterior leaflet produces a variable degree of stenosis between the portion of ventricle proximal to it (atrialized ventricle) and that distal to it (functional or ventricularized ventricle), because blood can pass only between openings that remain between the leaflet margin and ventricular wall (or through the commissures when these are present) (Fig. 42-3). Stiffness of the anterior leaflet contributes to stenosis.

Although important stenosis is uncommon, most Ebstein valves are regurgitant, often severely so (Fig. 42-4). This is contributed to by marked dilatation of the true tricuspid anulus and the RV, as by well as by morphologic abnormalities of the tricuspid valve.

The functional tricuspid orifice is determined by the hinge points of the valve leaflets, which rotate around the aortic root. The resultant functional valve orifice resides at the junction of the inlet and apical trabecular portions of the RV. We emphasize Anderson's focus on this rotational understanding of Ebstein anomaly to differentiate it from

#### Right Ventricle

Rotational displacement of the valve divides the RV into proximal *(atrialized)* and distal *(ventricularized)* portions. The proximal portion lies between the true tricuspid anulus and the valve attachment and comprises a variable portion of the posterior and inferior (diaphragmatic) aspects of the ventricular cavity (see Figs. 42-3 and 42-4). The right coronary artery denotes location of the true tricuspid anulus.

The proximal portion is atrialized in about one fourth of hearts in which the posterior and septal leaflets are severely displaced (Fig. 42-5). This atrialized portion of ventricular wall is dilated. Uncommonly, it is so thin as to seem aneurysmal, in which case it is largely fibrous tissue, and the endocardium is smooth. When very thin, it moves paradoxically during ventricular systole and may also expand during atrial systole. Its electrical potentials are ventricular, but its

pressure pulse has an atrial contour. More commonly, the wall of the atrialized portion is thicker than this and contains variable amounts of muscle.

The functional ventricularized portion of the RV lies distal (downstream) to the displaced valve and is therefore smaller than the normal RV. However, this feature is modified by RV dilatation, which is an almost constant finding. The functional portion consists of the infundibulum (conus), trabeculated apex, and that portion of the ventricle beneath the large anterior cusp (anterolateral recess)A4 (Figs. 42-6 and 42-7).

Ebstein anomaly is more than a valve abnormality, in that the RV has an underlying myopathy. The dilated functional ventricle is usually thinner walled than normal and contains fewer muscle fibers. Anderson and Lie suggested there may be a congenital paucity of myocardial cells in the RV, such that dilatation of both portions of the ventricle is part of the developmental anomaly rather than entirely its hemodynamic consequence.A5

In 1988, Carpentier proposed a *classification system* based on size of the functional RV and adequacy of the anterior leaflet for repairA9,C3:

- Type A: volume of true RV is adequate.
- Type B: a large atrialized component of RV is present, and anterior leaflet of tricuspid valve moves freely.

**Figure 42-5** Morphology of Ebstein anomaly. This image at operation shows typical Ebstein anomaly. Septal and posterior leaflets are displaced below tricuspid anulus and are fused to endocardium of right ventricle, producing an atrialized portion. Anterior leaflet of tricuspid valve is enlarged and sail-like.

- Type C: movement of anterior leaflet is severely restricted and may cause obstruction of RV outflow tract.
- Type D: RV is nearly completely atrialized, except for a small infundibular component.

There is usually an interatrial communication (60% of autopsy specimens, 42% at catheterization, and 21 of 22 surgical cases in Watson's collective review), most commonly a patent foramen ovale, although an atrial septal defect (ASD) of any type may be present.W1 Interatrial communication was present in 94% of patients at operation in the series reported by Danielson and colleagues.D4 Rarely, an ostium primum AV septal defect coexists.

The bundle of His and AV node lie in their usual locations, although the right bundle and node may be compressed by thickened endocardium (a possible explanation of the frequent right bundle branch block pattern in the electrocardiogram).B7,H3,L2,L3 WPW syndrome is present in about 14% of persons with Ebstein anomaly.D4,T5

## Left Ventricle

Monibi and colleagues and Ng and colleagues report that abnormal left ventricular contraction and contour and mitral valve prolapse are frequently present.M13,N5 Marked dilatation of the RV produces leftward septal shift and compression and posterior displacement of the left ventricle. Daliento and colleagues studied nine autopsied hearts and found the ventricular septum normal in six and thin in three, which could account for the exaggerated leftward diastolic movement observed by angiography in 24 of 26 patients.D1 Severe leftward displacement produced a "banana" appearance of

the left ventricle. Regional left ventricular wall motion abnormality was observed in 67% of patients. In a Mayo Clinic experience of over 500 surgical patients with Ebstein anomaly, 9% had moderate or severe LV dysfunction.B14 When mitral valve prolapse is present, the valve is frequently nodular and thickened.C1,D1,L2,R8 A Mayo Clinic study of 106 patients identified left ventricular abnormalities in 39%, of whom 18% had left ventricular dysplasia resembling noncompaction.A10

#### Lungs

In severe Ebstein anomaly associated with fetal and neonatal distress or death, both lungs are usually hypoplastic but otherwise normal. The hypoplasia is secondary to gross cardiomegaly from severe tricuspid regurgitation.L1

#### Associated Anomalies

An ASD is present in 80% to 95% of patients with Ebstein anomaly.B13,D4 *Pulmonary atresia* or *stenosis* may be present in up to one third of autopsied hearts (see Chapters 39 and 40).B4 Others include ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, patent ductus arteriosus, transposition of the great arteries, coarctation of the aorta, and congenital mitral stenosis.B4,K11,L3,W1

In *congenitally corrected transposition* with atrial situs solitus, the tricuspid valve lies within a left-sided, systemic, morphologically right ventricle. Although 30% of these left-sided valves are regurgitant, this is frequently due to Ebstein anomaly.A3,A6 This Ebstein anomaly differs from the usual right-sided form in that dilatation of the AV ring and separation of the morphologic RV into atrialized and ventricularized portions are uncommon. The anterior leaflet is also less prominent and may be cleft (see Chapter 55).

# CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

Mechanisms Underlying Clinical Presentation and Natural History

Three primary pathophysiologic features predominate in patients with Ebstein anomaly:

- RV abnormalities
- Tricuspid valve abnormalities
- Accessory conduction pathways (WPW syndrome)

Their severity determines secondary pathophysiologic features, clinical presentation, and natural history.

## *Right Ventricular Abnormalities*

Severity of RV abnormality is partly related to the extent to which the number of muscle fibers in the ventricular wall is reduced.A5 Nearly all patients have at least mild RV cavity enlargement and wall thinning. In the most severe cases, the RV cavity is greatly enlarged and free wall extremely thin.R7 The ventricular septum is often abnormal as well, with leftward bulging and consequent reduction in cavity size of the left ventricle, impairing left ventricular function.B6,D1 In the most advanced examples, the RV free wall is paper thin, a condition referred to as *Uhl disease.*

Extensiveness of the atrialized portion of the RV, which exhibits systolic expansion rather than contraction, importantly affects RV performance. RV dysfunction, along with tricuspid valve regurgitation, is responsible for right atrial enlargement and its wall thickening, which are at times extreme.

In aggregate, these abnormalities of RV structure and function underlie the variable cardiomegaly exhibited by patients with Ebstein anomaly: hepatomegaly, ascites, and fluid retention that may be advanced; cyanosis that is occasionally extreme, resulting from right-to-left shunting across a patent foramen ovale or ASD; and paroxysms of supraventricular and occasionally ventricular tachyarrhythmias that can cause advanced disability and sometimes sudden death.

#### *Tricuspid Valve Abnormalities*

Tricuspid regurgitation, usually present to some degree, exacerbates the abnormalities of RV structure and function. Degree of regurgitation is determined by the valve's morphologic anomalies. Those valves in which the anterior leaflet is tightly tethered and adherent to the underlying RV free wall and septum and, to a lesser extent, those in which the posterior leaflet is displaced and immobilized, are more likely to be regurgitant.R7

Pulmonary hypoplasia, a feature that contributes to neonatal death, is correlated with the degree of tricuspid regurgitation, occurring in association with severe regurgitation and gross cardiomegaly. If these features are corrected, the lungs presumably grow normally.L1

## *Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome*

Arrhythmic features of WPW syndrome, present in about 14% of patients, may dominate the clinical picture in patients whose tricuspid valve and RV anomalies are mild (see Section III in Chapter 16).

#### *Associated Anomalies*

In general, coexisting cardiac anomalies have little impact on the clinical features and course of patients with Ebstein anomaly. Exceptions are congenital pulmonary stenosis or atresia; when these coexist with Ebstein anomaly, death in utero or soon after birth is common. A patent foramen ovale or ASD, present in many patients, is necessary for right-to-left shunting and for the occasional paradoxical embolus or cerebral abscess that develops, but otherwise usually plays little role in the etiology of signs and symptoms. However, in the uncommon circumstance of only mild RV and tricuspid abnormalities, important left-to-right shunting may occur across an ASD.

# Symptoms and Signs

Breathlessness in association with cyanosis, severe cardiomegaly, and often heart failure may appear during the first week of life. However, many patients have milder symptoms and do not present until later in life. Nonetheless, objective exercise testing shows that their functional capacity is less than normal.B2 Oxygen saturation at rest is a major predictor of exercise tolerance.M1 Mild dyspnea and fatigue may become evident in childhood or early adult life, or more severe symptoms and signs of various types may develop. If heart failure develops, the patient becomes severely limited by breathlessness and fatigue.

Cyanosis is a common sign of Ebstein anomaly, occurring in more than half of patients and severe in about one third.K11 It may appear at birth, but in most patients onset is in infancy or early childhood.

Palpitations caused by various types of arrhythmia are also common.B9 Severe arrhythmic symptoms are frequent in patients of all ages and may be disabling. WPW syndrome is the best known type of arrhythmia, but less specific types of supraventricular tachycardias are more common. Numerous electrophysiologic abnormalities have been identified, which no doubt account for the frequent occurrence and persistence of arrhythmic symptoms even after operation.H3,K2 Symptoms are more severe when there are important associated cardiac anomalies.

A malar flush, similar to the so-called mitral facies, was noted by Ebstein's colleague and occurs in about one third of patients.S3 It is unrelated to cyanosis or polycythemia or to cardiac output.K11

The left anterior chest is often prominent in association with marked cardiomegaly, and there may be a systolic thrill along the left sternal edge originating from the tricuspid valve. Characteristically, the precordium and apex remain quiet despite marked cardiomegaly. Jugular venous pressure is generally unremarkable and rarely suggests tricuspid regurgitation or stenosis, even though free tricuspid regurgitation is revealed by imaging studies.W4 This is related to the large size and compliance of both the right atrium and atrialized RV, as well as the low RV and pulmonary artery pressure. Congestive hepatosplenomegaly is commonly observed and may lead to hepatic fibrosis.D10

On auscultation the most constant finding is wide splitting of the first sound with accentuation of the delayed component caused by closing (or termination of motionC8,F1) of the large anterior tricuspid leaflet. Delayed tricuspid valve closure is probably mechanical rather than related to right bundle branch block, although Crews and colleagues considered it correlated with the latter.C8,G5 The large anterior leaflet is also responsible for an opening snap in diastole, and there may be an atrial fourth sound. The pulmonary component of the second sound is delayed and soft (in relation to the right bundle branch block) or absent when pulmonary artery pressure is low. A pansystolic murmur maximal at the lower left sternal edge is due to tricuspid regurgitation and is heard in about one third of patients. Finally, there is usually a diastolic murmur, often low pitched and sometimes scratchy in quality, commencing with the opening snap and sometimes augmented by the fourth sound. The diastolic murmur is presumably due to movement of blood across the malformed tricuspid orifice.

#### Chest Radiography

In classic Ebstein anomaly, the chest radiograph shows marked cardiomegaly with a rounded or boxlike cardiac contour beneath a narrow pedicle (Fig. 42-8). In the posteroanterior view the whole of the silhouette is then formed by the right atrium and RV, and because of their minimal excursion and the normal or oligemic lung fields, the silhouette has a peculiarly sharp edge. However, as with other features of the disease, there is wide variation in heart size.S3 In a few cases, it remains normal; in most, it is only moderately enlarged.K11

**Figure 42-8** Chest radiograph of a 12-year-old girl with classic Ebstein anomaly.

## Electrocardiography

A right bundle branch pattern together with a relatively lowamplitude R wave in right-sided chest leads and right atrial hypertrophy are characteristic of the anomaly. According to Kumar and colleagues, height of the P wave varies inversely with arterial oxygen saturation (r = .82, *P* < .001).K11 In addition, the taller the P wave, the shorter the survival time (*P* < .001). RV hypertrophy does not occur in uncomplicated Ebstein anomaly, and inverted T waves in leads V1 to V4 are fairly common. Using intraluminal electrode catheters, Kastor and colleagues demonstrated prolonged intra–right atrial and infranodal conduction in patients with a large right atrium and well-defined atrialized ventricle.K2

In approximately 14% of patients, the electrocardiogram shows type B (right-sided) WPW syndrome. In any cyanotic patient with this type of preexcitation, Ebstein anomaly should be considered. Supraventricular arrhythmias occur in more than half of patients, and they may be paroxysmal and recurrent. Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and nodal rhythm can all occur, as can first-degree heart block. Serious ventricular arrhythmias resulting from RV dilatation may also occur.D10

## Echocardiography

Two-dimensional echocardiography has become definitive for diagnosis and anatomic evaluation of Ebstein anomalyB6,M2,M6,N6,S13 (Fig. 42-9). It is possible to identify Ebstein anomaly by the characteristic degree of displacement of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve (>8 mm · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> ) and the presence of an elongated, redundant anterior tricuspid valve leaflet.A2,S10 The feasibility of tricuspid repair rather than replacement can be determined with this method of imaging.S13 A right-to-left atrial shunt and tricuspid regurgitation can be demonstrated using Doppler color flow interrogation.

Historically, M-mode echocardiography usually demonstrated delayed tricuspid valve closure and displacement of the tricuspid valve to the left. According to Giuliani and colleagues, the greater the delay in tricuspid valve closure, the more severe the disease.G5 Wide excursion of the anterior leaflet, a decreased E-F slope, increased RV dimensions, and paradoxical septal motion can also be demonstrated.

![](_page_8_Figure_8.jpeg)

**Figure 42-9** Two-dimensional echocardiogram of Ebstein anomaly. There is characteristic displacement of hinge point of septal leaflet below natural tricuspid anulus and adherence to septal wall. Anterior leaflet is elongated.

#### Cardiac Catheterization and Cineangiography

Currently, cardiac catheterization and cineangiography are required only when specific hemodynamic details need to be identified,S13 or in patients about aged 40, when the coronary tree should be examined.

In the past, cardiac catheterization showed that the mean right atrial pressure is often modestly elevated, and the pressure pulse may have either a dominant *a* or *v* wave. These correlate poorly with degree of tricuspid regurgitation or stenosis. An additional *s* wave preceding the *v* wave and interrupting the *c* wave is said to indicate tricuspid regurgitation.G5,K11,S3 The right atrial waveform is also recorded in the atrialized portion of the RV so that the tricuspid valve is noted to be displaced well toward the left of the spine. An *electrode catheter* may define the position and size of the atrialized RV chamber.M9,Y3 RV systolic pressure is normal or low, and RV end-diastolic pressure is frequently elevated, more so when there is the syndrome of chronic heart failure. It is uncommon to record an important gradient across the tricuspid valve, although Takayasu and colleagues noted this in 8 of 26 cases and considered that stenosis could still be important in its absence.K11,T1

When there is an interatrial communication, the shunt through it is usually right to left in association with systemic arterial desaturation and a reduced pulmonary blood flow (Qp ). The right-to-left shunt can be quantified by indicator dilution. The shunt may occasionally be left to right, and the resultant increase in Qp may be associated with heart failure.M8 Direction of shunting is no doubt influenced by RV compliance.

In the newborn with Ebstein anomaly, a functional pulmonary outflow obstruction can occur.N4 Thus, a normal pulmonary valve may fail to open following a right-sided injection of contrast media because of the combination of massive tricuspid regurgitation, poor RV contraction, and a high neonatal pulmonary vascular resistance with or without a large shunt at ductal level. High-quality imaging is therefore necessary to distinguish this situation from true pulmonary atresia.

Cineangiography (see Figs. 42-3 to 42-7) is usually diagnostic as long as there is important displacement and dysplasia of the septal or posterior leaflets.D13 In the right anterior oblique projection, the conjoined posterior and anterior leaflets, and therefore the distal limit of the atrialized ventricle, can frequently be identified. Contrast media trapped beneath the posterior leaflet can indicate the degree of its adherence to, and level of its origin from, the diaphragmatic border of the RV, which may be notched at this point.S17 The site of the true anulus is also visible more proximally. An injection into the functional RV enables tricuspid regurgitation to be assessed together with size and behavior of the functional ventricle. Angiography in left anterior oblique projection also permits visualization of the right-to-left shunt at atrial level, and any ventricular septal defects can be localized by left ventriculography.

# NATURAL HISTORY

Ebstein anomaly is uncommon, with a prevalence of 0.5% and occurring in less than 1% of subjects with congenital heart disease.K3 The incidence is equal in both sexes. Familial Ebstein anomaly has been reported rarely.E2,G8,S16 It occurs

with more frequency in babies of mothers who are on lithium medication during pregnancy.L5,R1

The natural history is determined primarily by the three primary pathophysiologic features described in Clinical Features and Diagnostic Criteria earlier in this chapter. Extent and severity of these relate to age at presentation; thus, age at presentation tends to correlate with prognosis. The presentation takes two general forms: symptomatic neonatal and infant presentation, and presentation in older children and adults.

#### Presentation during First Week of Life

Ebstein anomaly is a recognized cause of death in utero.G4,H4,L1 When severe tricuspid regurgitation accompanies Ebstein anomaly at birth, the elevated newborn pulmonary vascular resistance worsens it. Qp may be ductal dependent. The resultant severe hypoxemia (right-to-left shunting through an ASD), coupled with marked right-sided heart failure, may also be accompanied by low cardiac output if the ASD is restrictive. This is because maintenance of normal cardiac output requires shunting at the atrial level through a nonrestrictive ASD. Low cardiac output may also result from abnormal ventricular interactions caused by paradoxical septal bowing and flattening of the left ventricle. The hypoxemia may be aggravated by pulmonary dysfunction secondary to lung compression by marked cardiomegaly. Although lung hypoplasia has been suggested,C6,L1 pathologic studies indicate that the lungs are rarely hypoplastic in surviving newborns, but are instead compressed by the enlarged heart.T2

Celermajer and colleagues from Great Ormond Street identified neonates with good and poor outcomes based on a score (Celermajer Score or Great Ormond Street Ratio)A9,C5 derived from echocardiographic measurements of the right atrium, RV, left atrium, and left ventricle.C6 The score is calculated from a four-chamber echocardiographic view in which the combined area of the anatomic right atrium plus atrialized RV is divided by the sum of the areas of the functional (nonatrialized) RV, left atrium, and left ventricle (Table 42-2). The outlook is generally dismal for patients with Celermajer grades 3 or 4C6,Y2 (severe Ebstein anomaly;

Fig. 42-10). Importantly, patients with Ebstein anomaly who survive after presentation early in life have a good chance of long-term survival.G3

Many studies have probably underestimated the incidence and severity of this entity in neonates. The review by Vacca and colleagues of 108 clinical or autopsy cases reported between 1866 and 1957 recorded only two patients younger than 1 month.V1 In Watson's collective review of 505 cases, only 35 (7%) were younger than 1 year (half were younger than 1 month).W1 In Bialostozky and colleagues' review of 65 patients, neonates were not included.B9 In a Mayo Clinic series, only 10 of 67 patients were diagnosed in infancy.G5 In a Boston Children's Hospital series, 12 of their 55 patients (22%) were seen during the first week of life, and 34 (64%) were younger than 2 years.K11 Eleven of the 34 died early. These series must have been in some way selective and therefore are not useful in assessing natural history. In contrast, Schiebler and colleagues' earlier study from the Mayo Clinic found that 12 of 23 patients presented during the neonatal period, and of these, 5 died.S3 Roberson and Silverman reported that among 16 consecutive patients diagnosed in utero or presenting during the first 3 days of life, 7 died before age 3 months; all had severe RV and tricuspid morphologic abnormalities.R7 In the 40-institution administrative registry of the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS), of 464 neonates diagnosed with Ebstein anomaly from January 2003 to January 2008, 415 with complete data, mortality during initial hospitalization among 257 (62%) managed medically was 22% (56/257; CL 19%-25%).G7

# Presentation in Infancy

Presentation in infancy is associated with less risk of death and milder symptoms than occur with neonatal presentation (Fig. 42-11), although some studies suggest an increased mortality until presentation is beyond about 6 months.G5,K11,W1 Beyond this age, Watson's series indicates a prognosis similar to that of older children.W1 He states that "whereas 72% of those under 1 year were in heart failure, 71% of the children and adolescents had little or no disability."

# Presentation in Childhood and Adult Life

Patients presenting after infancy often have mild symptoms. Prognosis is generally good, consistent with less severe RV and tricuspid valve pathophysiology.S11 Patients presenting in adult life are often acyanotic and have a normal-sized heart.G4 However, even these patients, who report few symptoms, have clearly definable abnormalities. Without preexcitation, nearly half have episodic supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, although these usually produce few symptoms.S18 Exercise tolerance measured by objective testing is often reduced.B2,D15,M1,S2 The degree of tricuspid regurgitation does not correlate with symptoms, but as time passes, left ventricular dysfunction often appears as symptoms develop.S2

Death in this group of patients is often due to paroxysmal embolization or paradoxical supraventricular tachycardia, with heart failure appearing either much later or not at all. An atrial level communication increases the risk of paradoxical embolism, brain abscess, and sudden death.

## Modes of Death

Heart failure is the mode of death in somewhat less than half of patients who die of causes related to their heart disease after the neonatal period.K11,W1 Sudden death, presumably caused for the most part by arrhythmias other than those associated with WPW, occurs in about 60% (CL 43%-77%) of these patients.G3,G4,W1 Sudden death correlates with marked cardiomegaly, rather than with New York Heart Association (NYHA) status.G3 Cerebral abscess and paradoxical emboli account for most of the remaining deaths, particularly in patients older than about 50 years.G4,M7 Infective endocarditis is rare.

#### TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

Repair of Tricuspid Valve and Atrial Septal Defect Closure

The usual preparations are made for operation, anesthetic management (see Chapter 4), and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (see Chapter 2). Before commencing CPB, the atrialized portion of the RV is assessed, noting particularly whether it moves paradoxically.

CPB is established using two venous cannulae, and the patient's body temperature is lowered to about 25°C. The aorta is occluded and tourniquets secured around the venae cavae and cannulae. Cold cardioplegia may be administered directly into the aortic root or into the coronary sinus after the atrium is opened (see "Technique of Retrograde Infusion" in Chapter 3). The right atrium is incised parallel to the AV groove. A sump-sucker is placed across the atrial septum into the left atrium.

The atrial septum and tricuspid valve are examined (Fig. 42-12). The anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve is studied with particular care, because successful repair of a regurgitant tricuspid valve relies on it. The anterior leaflet is rarely displaced into the RV, but if it is, the tricuspid valve may require replacement (see "Replacement of Tricuspid Valve" in text that follows). However, if the displacement is limited to that portion near the commissure, repair may be possible. Extreme thickening of the anterior leaflet, and particularly the dense attachment of its free edge to the underlying RV endocardium, makes successful repair unlikely and therefore contraindicates it.D4

Tricuspid valve repair with ASD closure is the preferred operation.K5 Most repairs are designed to convert the tricuspid valve into a monoleaflet valve using the anterior leaflet to establish valve competence. The most important features that predict successful repair are a mobile, free leading edge of the anterior leaflet and attachment of more than 50% of it at the anatomic tricuspid anulus. A variety of maneuvers have been used to mobilize and extend this leading edge, with or without plication of the atrialized portion of the RV.

The method devised by Danielson and colleagues is the best tested.D2,D5,D6,M2,T3 It plicates the atrialized portion of the ventricle, narrows the tricuspid orifice in a selective manner, and results in a monoleaflet valve that is usually competent or nearly so. A modification of the Danielson method in which the tricuspid valve anulus is remodeled by an anuloplasty ring is shown in Fig. 42-13. D14 Dearani and colleagues have also recommended moving the anterior leaflet closer to the ventricular septum by displacing the major papillary muscles supporting the anterior leaflet to a position closer to the septum. This is accomplished by placing pledgeted mattress sutures from the papillary muscle to the ventricular septumA9,D12 (Fig. 42-14).

An alternative is the Carpentier repair, in which the anterior leaflet is mobilized and detached from the anulus. The atrialized ventricle is plicated vertically, at right angles to the direction used by DanielsonC3 (Fig. 42-15). The anterior leaflet is advanced and reattached to the true anulus. This

Downward displacement of tricuspid valve divides RV into a proximal atrialized portion and a distal ventricularized portion. Anterior leaflet is enlarged and elongated, described as sail-like. There is a foramen ovale type of atrial septal defect. Coronary sinus, atrioventricular node, and bundle of His are in their usual locations.

Atrial septal defect is closed by pericardial patch. **B,** Plication sutures are tied over anuloplasty ring to remodel the anulus and obliterate atrialized portion of the RV to complete the repair.

Incision is continued to the point at which valve begins to be displaced on ventricular wall at atrialized portion of right ventricle (RV). **B,** Detached leaflet is everted to expose support mechanism. There is usually chordal fusion, which may be marked in some cases. Fenestrations are made in the support mechanism to lengthen chordae and relieve obstruction below leaflets. **C,** Unique aspect of repair is placing pledget-reinforced plication stitches in atrialized portion of RV to create a vertical plication. Plication stitches are continued from base of leaflet attachment to ventricle to true anulus. Anulus is narrowed by this technique. A few stitches are placed in floor of right atrium. Plication stitches may be woven across atrialized portion for better obliteration of this portion of ventricle. *Continued*

**D,** Detached portion of tricuspid leaflet is rotated clockwise to cover tricuspid orifice beyond plication and as far toward septum as it will reach comfortably. Leaflet is reattached to anulus by continuous suture. **E,** Repair is supported by a Carpentier anuloplasty ring, which also remodels shape of anulus. It is attached to tricuspid anulus by a series of mattress sutures placed at perimeter of anulus. These stitches are most easily placed before anterior leaflet is reattached. A gap in the anuloplasty ring protects conduction system from injury. **Figure 42-15, cont'd**

repair may result in more normal size and shape of the RV than does the Danielson technique.

A further extension of the Carpentier repair has been proposed by da Silva and colleaguesD7 and termed the *cone procedure* (Fig. 42-16). The anterior and posterior leaflets are detached from the anulus as a single unit, mobilized from their anomalous attachments in the RV, and rotated in a clockwise fashion to be sutured to the septal border of the anterior leaflet. The rotated leaflets are reattached to the true anatomic anulus. When possible, the septal leaflet is detached and incorporated into the repair. The anatomic anulus is plicated with two sutures at its true anular level. This repair does not incorporate an anuloplasty ring. da Silva and colleagues incorporate a longitudinal plication of the atrialized portion, but the value of this maneuver is controversial (see "Indications for Plication of Atrialized Ventricle" under Special Situations and Controversies). da Silva and colleagues recommend closing the foramen ovale in a valved fashion (see Fig. 42-16).

The technique described by Ullman and SebeningU1 also involves mobilizing and reattaching the septal, anterior, and posterior leaflets to allow anterior leaflet coaptation with the septal leaflet at the anatomic anular level without exclusion of the atrialized ventricle. The anuloplasty technique pioneered by Sebening involves narrowing the tricuspid valve orifice with a pledgeted mattress suture placed from the center of the anatomic anulus of the anterior leaflet to the native anulus on the opposite side, creating a double orifice valve. The posterior anulus can be closed with additional pledgeted sutures or left open, as needed to produce a competent valve. Variations of this technique have been reported by HetzerK10,N1 and by Hanley's group,M3 who recommend the "play it where it lies" approach (Fig. 42-17) in which no attempt is made to reattach the septal or posterior leaflet at the level of the anatomic anulus.

Others have used autologous or bovine pericardium to augment the anterior leafletO1 or septal leafletB10 (Fig. 42-18) to increase the area of leaflet coaptation. Midterm follow-up on a small number of patients has indicated good valve function.

Use of a *bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt* as an adjunctive procedure to create a one-and-a-half ventricle repair is an important surgical option to consider in valve reconstruction procedures.M3,Q2 A protocolized approach to application of a one-and-a-half ventricle strategy (see Special Situations and Controversies) may increase the frequency of successful valve repair with aggressive anuloplasty techniques that may create some degree of tricuspid valve stenosis in order to eliminate regurgitation.M3

#### Replacement of Tricuspid Valve

In about 20% to 30% of patients, immobility or morphology of the tricuspid valve prevents repair and valve replacement is required.D4 For this, the leaflet tissue is excised (Fig. 42-19, *A*), leaving a more generous portion of the base of the anterior and septal leaflets where they attach to the membranous septum and right trigone at the point of penetration of the bundle of His. The general suture technique for inserting the valve prosthesis is described in Chapters 11 and 14. When the septal and posterior leaflets are displaced into the RV, or the septal leaflet is absent, sutures may be passed through the usual location of the tricuspid ring. Alternatively, the suture line in this area can be placed well posterior to the AV node area and coronary sinus, as described by Barnard and Schrire.B3 The replacement valve is usually a large mechanical prosthesis (Fig. 42-19, *B*) or stent-mounted xenograft. A pulmonary allograft mounted in a short polyester sleeve has been used.M11 A mitral allograft could also be considered.A1,R2

**Figure 42-17** "Play it where it lies" approach to repair of Ebstein anomaly. Operation involves limited plication of tricuspid valve. Points *A* and *B* are approximated with one or two mattress sutures at the level of the native valve, not to the level of the true tricuspid anulus. This results in approximating apical aspects of septal and anterior leaflets, effectively creating a bicuspid valve. (From Malhotra and colleagues.M3)

Patch of polytetrafluoroethylene is tailored to form a new septal anulus, attached to the atrium remote from the area of the atrioventricular node. Accommodation for coronary sinus is made by placing a notch in the patch. Tailored patch in place, defining a new septal anulus and an armature, onto which leaflet advancement is performed, attached at the plane of the reconstructed anulus. All suture material is remote from the atrioventricular node and bundle of His. (From Bichell and colleagues.B10)

Device is attached to anulus by pledget-reinforced mattress sutures. Atrialized portion of the right ventricle may be plicated by sutures used to attach the prosthesis. (From Doty and colleagues.D14)

When the atrialized ventricle is thin walled and fibrous and moves paradoxically, it is plicated by passing sutures used to position the valve first through tissue that forms the margin of the atrialized ventricle (corresponding to attachment of the displaced septal and posterior leaflets) and then through the true tricuspid ring. The valve is seated and sutures tied and cut. If the atrialized ventricle has been plicated, this portion may be further obliterated by a running polypropylene suture placed from outside the heart, taking care not to compromise the arterial supply of the remainder of the RV

by occluding large coronary arteries. Plication is probably unnecessary in most cases when valve replacement is performed.W2

The interatrial communication is closed. In many instances, the septal tissue is stretched and the fossa ovalis tissue thinned. A patch must then be used (pericardium is ideal); it is positioned without tension using a continuous 4-0 polypropylene suture (see Fig. 42-13, *A*). Direct suture is avoided unless the tissues are strong and the defect small, which is uncommon. The left atrium is deliberately not emptied of blood, and the patch suture line is completed at the highest point (superiorly) to avoid air entrapment on the left side of the septum.

The right atriotomy is closed. When the atrium is very large, its size may be reduced by excising an ellipse from the lateral wall. The procedure is completed in the usual fashion, including placement of atrial and ventricular pacing wires and left and right atrial pressure catheters (see Chapter 2).

#### Simple Atrial Septal Defect Closure

Simple ASD closure may be done as described for closure in conjunction with valve replacement. However, this procedure is rarely indicated in patients with Ebstein anomaly.

## Ventricular Exclusion in Critically Ill Neonates (Starnes Operation)

The Starnes operation is designed to abolish the detrimental tricuspid regurgitation by patch closing the tricuspid valve, creating a widely opened and nonrestrictive ASD, and establishing controlled pulmonary blood flow through a systemicto–pulmonary artery shunt. A single ventricle palliation strategy is then pursued.S18

CPB is established. Bicaval cannulation may be used (see "Venous Cannulation" in Section III of Chapter 2) and the operation performed during hypothermic CPB. Alternatively, a single venous cannula may be used and the intraatrial portion of the operation performed during hypothermic circulatory arrest. Cold cardioplegia is used (see "Cold Cardioplegia, Controlled Aortic Root Reperfusion, and [When Needed] Warm Cardioplegic Induction" in Chapter 3). The right atrium is opened obliquely. The ASD is enlarged by excising all remnants of the septum primum (floor of the fossa ovalis). The tricuspid valve is closed by sewing into place an appropriately sized pericardial patch, sewn at the anatomic level of the tricuspid anulus. The coronary sinus is maintained on the atrial side of the patch. The patch is fenestrated with a 4-mm punch (Fig. 42-20). The right atrium is reduced in size by removing a segment of the right atrial free wall, and then is closed. If this portion of the procedure is done during hypothermic circulatory arrest, CPB is reestablished. If pulmonary regurgitation is present, the proximal main pulmonary trunk is closed.

A systemic-pulmonary shunt is created. Starnes and colleagues prefer a central shunt of 4-mm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tube interposed between the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk.S18 Alternatively, a 3.5- or 4-mm PTFE tube may be interposed between the brachiocephalic–right carotid artery junction and the medial aspect of the right pulmonary artery (see "Reconstructive Surgery" in Chapter 49), or between the right lateral aspect of the ascending aorta and anterior aspect of the right pulmonary artery. After rewarming has been accomplished, the remainder of the operation is completed in the usual manner (see "Completing Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2). The sternum is generally left open and the skin closed with a patch of bovine pericardium. The sternum can usually be closed in the intensive care unit 48 to 72 hours later.

## Treatment of Arrhythmias

Dearani and colleagues at the Mayo ClinicA9 recommend routine electrophysiologic evaluation in children and adults undergoing Ebstein repair. If arrhythmic substrate is identified (e.g., WPW syndrome is present), and there is a history of life-threatening paroxysmal arrhythmia, the accessory conduction pathways are divided at the same operation, after proper electrophysiologic studyM12,S8 (see Technique of Intervention in Section III of Chapter 16). This is generally done before valve repair or replacement. Alternatively, these pathways may be obliterated preoperatively in the electrophysiology laboratory.O2

Supraventricular arrhythmia such as atrial flutter and fibrillation may occur paroxysmally or chronically as the right atrium enlarges. A right-sided maze procedure may be done at the time of operation.S19,T4

## SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Postoperative care is as usual after repair or replacement of the tricuspid valve for Ebstein anomaly (see Chapter 5). Convalescence is generally rapid and normal.

Critically ill neonates undergoing the Starnes operation, however, require the type of care accorded all neonates in whom pulmonary blood flow originates exclusively from the systemic circulation (see "General Care of Neonates and Infants" in Chapter 5). Additionally, pulmonary artery vasodilatation is encouraged by nitric oxide administration (see Chapter 5). Lowering pulmonary vascular resistance decreases the tendency to RV distention (see Special Situations and Controversies). Further operations and procedures follow the Fontan pathway strategies (see Indications for Operation and Special Situations and Controversies in Section IV of Chapter 41).

## RESULTS AFTER REPAIR

## Survival

## *Mortality after Surgery in the Neonatal Period*

Historically, hospital mortality has been high (>50%) for critically ill neonates who undergo emergency or urgent operation. However, with current techniques of intensive neonatal medical management and surgical and percutaneous therapy as needed, survival has importantly improved. Thus, in the 40-institution report of the PHIS, overall hospital mortality of neonates initially managed by percutaneous procedures with or without surgery was 22% (9/40; CL 15%-31%), for those managed by systemic-to–pulmonary shunting 27%, for those undergoing tricuspid valve repair 31%, and for those receiving a transplant 0%G7 (Table 42-3). Notably, half the neonates were medically managed, and 15% were managed by placement of a systemic-to–pulmonary system shunt, 9.6% by a percutaneous procedure, 8.7% by single ventricle palliation, and 3.9% by tricuspid valve repair.

Among 16 neonates undergoing surgical intervention between 1992 and 2005, Starnes and colleagues reported a hospital mortality of 31% with a variety of surgical procedures (Reemtsan 2006). The best survival occurred in the 10 patients (80% hospital survival; CL 59%-93%) who underwent patch fenestration as part of a RV exclusion procedure (Starnes operation). No late deaths were reported, all had undergone a subsequent bidirectional Glenn, and three had a completed Fontan.

Knott-Craig and colleaguesK8 have pursued tricuspid valve repair and two-ventricle physiology, creating a competent monoleaflet valve based on the anterior leaflet, partially closing the ASD, and performing a reduction atrioplasty. Hospital survival among neonates exceeded 65%, but mortality was 55% (6/11; CL 35%-73%) among patients with anatomic pulmonary atresia.

An experience with surgical intervention in 24 neonates with Ebstein anomaly reported by Shinkawa and colleaguesS14 supports a policy of shunt only in the presence of refractory cyanosis without severe tricuspid regurgitation. In the presence of severe regurgitation and refractory heart failure, RV exclusion provided possibly superior hospital (73%, 8/11; CL 53%-87%) and late survival (63%) compared with tricuspid valve repair (25%, 1/4; CL 4.0%-62% for hospital and late survival).

# *Early (Hospital) Death in Children and Adults*

Thirty-day mortality in the Mayo Clinic series of 539 patients (1972-2006) was 6.1% (33 deaths; CL 5.0%-7.4%), but 2.7% after 2001, which is representative of what can be accomplished in these often ill patients.B14 Augustin and colleagues reported two hospital deaths among 60 patients (3.3%; CL 1.1%-7.7%) (1974-1995).A11 These results are improved over those obtained in an earlier era. A multicenter study from the European Congenital Heart Surgeons Association reported a hospital mortality of 8.3% (CL 5.4%-12%) among 96 patients undergoing tricuspid valve repair or replacement between 1992 and 2005.S1 In patients operated on from September 1993 to September 2008, Malhotra and colleagues report no early (0%; CL 0%-3.3%) or late mortality in a group of 57 non-neonatal patients (median age 8 years, range 7 months to 40 years), among whom 95% had valve repairs and 54% had concomitant cavopulmonary shunts.M3 Using near routine excision of atrialized RV, detachment and repair of the tricuspid valve leaflets, and anulus plication, Wu and colleaguesW6 reported no early mortality (0%; CL 0%-2.3%) among 83 patients operated on between 1997 and 2006.B12,K6,M10,P1,R9,W6,S7,S9 Among 52 children aged 5 months to 12 years undergoing repair of Ebstein anomaly at the Mayo Clinic between 1974 and 2003, early mortality was 5.8% (3/52; CL 2.6%-11%), with no deaths since 1984 (0/31; CL 0%-5.9%).B11 da Silva and colleagues reported a 2.5% hospital mortality (1/40; CL 0.4%-8.2%) among 40 patients undergoing the cone procedure between 1993 and 2005.D7

Mode of death is usually acute cardiac failure, probably related to preoperative RV enlargement and dysfunction. Improved methods of myocardial management, increasing prevalence and success of tricuspid valve repair rather than replacement, and possibly selective use of bidirectional cavopulmonary shunts have contributed to reduced early mortality.

## *Time-Related Survival*

The seriousness of Ebstein anomaly is well demonstrated in a long-term follow-up study of a heterogeneous group of patients without major associated cardiac anomalies, 18 of whom (*n* = 48) underwent 22 operations.G3 Median survival for the overall group was 47 years. Survival was similar in patients who presented during the first 3 days of life but survived to 6 months of age, and those who presented after 3 months of age. All four patients in whom permanent atrial fibrillation developed died within 5 years.

Late deaths are uncommon after tricuspid valve repair (or replacement) and ASD closure, with about 80% of patients surviving long term.B5,D5,W2 In the Mayo Clinic cohort of 539 patients, 10- and 20-year survival was 85% and 71%, respectively, with no important difference in late survival between patients undergoing valve repair vs. replacement.B14 Among 52 children undergoing repair, 15-year survival was 90%.B11 Deaths are often sudden and attributable to rhythm disturbances. Although it seems that late survival and freedom from reoperation would be better after successful valve repair than replacement, the Mayo Clinic analysis indicates no difference in late reoperation-free survival between patients receiving tricuspid valve repair vs. replacement among patients 12 years of age or older.B11 However, among patients under age 12, reoperation-free survival is superior for those undergoing valve repair.B14

Preoperative risk factors for late mortality include higher hematocrit (worse cyanosis), severe mitral valve regurgitation, prior cardiac operations, and moderate to severe reduction in RV systolic function.B14 Left ventricular dysfunction is also a risk factor for early and late mortality, despite the finding of improved left ventricular systolic function in most such patients following Ebstein anomaly repair.B14

## *Right Ventricular Function*

Little is known about the long-term fate of RV function after *neonatal surgery* for Ebstein anomaly. However, Reemtsen and colleagues compared echocardiographic findings at 6 to 204 months (median 30 months) with those immediately prior to the Starnes procedure performed in the neonatal period. The Great Ormond Street ratio (see Table 42-2) and RV size decreased prior to the bidirectional Glenn, indicating RV regression.R5 Left ventricular septal impingement on left ventricular cavity dimensions decreased an average of 38%, with normalization of left ventricular morphology and systolic function. These findings have important implications in predicting favorable outcomes after the Fontan operation if a single-ventricle strategy is selected in the neonatal period.

## Functional Status

Most patients (about 85%) achieve good functional status (NYHA class I or II) and improved performance during objective exercise testing postoperatively, although many are severely limited preoperatively.B14,D3,D15,S12,S15 Residual symptoms, when present, are usually related to troublesome, non-WPW supraventricular arrhythmias.W2 Failure to plicate the atrialized portion of the RV has not been shown to decrease the probability of a good functional result.S9 The effect of a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt on late functional status has been incompletely studied, but favorable midterm functional status has been reported.K4,M3

## Tricuspid Valve Function after Repair and Freedom from Reoperation

Although many reports indicate absent or mild tricuspid regurgitation early and midterm after repair,A11,C3,D3,Q1

concerns remain about the important occurrence of late tricuspid valve replacement. Several areas of controversy relate to the optimal methods to prevent late, progressive tricuspid regurgitation. The Danielson and Carpentier techniques (see Technique of Operation) rely on creating essentially a monoleaflet valve that coapts against the RV septum in the area of the septal leaflet. This area has been observed as the site of recurrent tricuspid regurgitation,D7 which theoretically may be obviated by direct leaflet coaptation in the septal area, as is achieved with the cone procedure (see Technique of Operation).

da Silva and colleagues reported no reoperations for tricuspid valve replacement, but one for re-repair and a 9% occurrence of moderately severe early tricuspid regurgitation among 40 patients who underwent the cone procedure.D7 Freedom from further tricuspid regurgitation has been maintained in the intermediate term.D8,D9 Whether this technique and repair principles provide an important improvement in late valve function will require further long-term studies.

## Postrepair Rhythm Disturbances

Complete heart block is uncommon after repair, despite the distorted morphology in the region of the bundle of His.

WPW has mostly been cured by concomitant sectioning of the accessory pathways (see Chapter 16), which can be accomplished without increasing operative risk.M12,S8 However, episodic non-WPW supraventricular tachycardia continues late postoperatively in about 20% of patients.C3,W2 Uncommonly, even after successful surgical relief of WPW syndrome, late sudden death occurs. The substrate for atrial arrhythmias is enhanced by the large right atrium, RV dysfunction, and tricuspid regurgitation that frequently accompany Ebstein anomaly late after operation. Stulak and colleagues at the Mayo ClinicS19 reported greater than 90% freedom from late recurrence of atrial fibrillation or flutter with a right-sided maze procedure plus isthmus ablation. An ongoing area of controversy relates to the possible benefit of a prophylactic right-sided maze procedure at the time of Ebstein anomaly repair.V2

## RESULTS OF OTHER PROCEDURES

# Repair of Atrial Septal Defect Alone

The risk associated with simple ASD closure is low in properly selected patients. In the combined UAB-GLH experience, nine patients with either left-to-right or right-to-left shunts and competent but abnormal tricuspid valves underwent simple ASD closure, with no hospital deaths (CL 0%-19%; Table 42-4). It is surprising that closure of the ASD was well tolerated in the face of preoperative right-to-left shunting, but this was also the experience at the Mayo Clinic and has been the case in pulmonary stenosis with intact ventricular septum (see Chapter 39).W5

When a left-to-right shunt is present preoperatively, late results are good (see Table 42-4). Thus, in the combined UAB-GLH experience, three patients in this category were hospital survivors; two had excellent long-term results, and one had WPW syndrome with episodic arrhythmias.

If the indication is appropriate, late results of simple ASD closure are also good in patients with right-to-left shunting preoperatively and important cyanosis. At late postoperative

Data from combined UAB-GLH experience.

follow-up, four of five such patients in the UAB-GLH experience were alive and acyanotic, but all had episodic arrhythmias, severe in three cases. Two patients considered themselves functionally normal (NYHA class I), whereas two were in NYHA class II (see Table 42-4). One patient had an initially good result, and then cyanosis and severe disability recurred. Three years after his initial operation, he died after reoperation for reclosure of the septal defect and tricuspid valve replacement.

## Tricuspid Valvotomy

The rare occurrence of tricuspid stenosis invites tricuspid valvotomy, but severe regurgitation may result.P1 If the Carpentier technique of fenestration to restore or substitute for interchordal spaces is not satisfactory, valve replacement is indicated.C3

#### Pulmonary Valvotomy

Pulmonary valvotomy can have low hospital mortality in patients with Ebstein anomaly when indications are appropriate. This procedure may be life saving in neonates, because it decreases the degree of tricuspid regurgitation.

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Neonates presenting in extremis, usually in the first week of life, are immediately intubated and begun on prostaglandin E1, appropriate catecholamine support, aggressive treatment of metabolic acidosis, and other intensive therapy (see Special Situations and Controversies). Once stabilized, a Starnes procedure is performed, particularly if the patient has a Celermajer grade of 3 or 4 (see Special Situations and Controversies). If the patient's condition does not stabilize, operation is performed at an exceptionally high risk. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) should be considered in such circumstances, either before or following emergency operation.

In the absence of severe cyanosis or symptoms of heart failure, medical management is advisable. Surgical intervention should be considered with the development of heart failure symptoms, worsening cyanosis, progressive increase in heart size, reduction in ventricular systolic function, or the appearance of atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmias.A9 The presence of severe tricuspid regurgitation and moderate cyanosis secondary to right-to-left shunting through the ASD should prompt earlier surgical intervention. Severe limitations and severe hypoxia are not contraindications to repair, although increased hospital mortality in patients in functional NYHA class IV argues strongly in favor of advising operation before disability is this advanced. The correlation between sudden death and cardiomegaly argues for operation when the cardiothoracic ratio reaches 0.60 or greater, regardless of symptoms.G3

Among patients under about 12 to 14 years of age, valve repair is greatly preferable to replacement. In older teenagers and adults, tricuspid valve replacement is a suitable option if repair appears unlikely to succeed.

Simple repair of the ASD is indicated when there is a large left-to-right shunt (Qp/Q s > 2), with or without symptoms of heart failure, and little or no tricuspid regurgitation. Simple repair of the ASD, *without* repair (or replacement if needed) of the tricuspid valve, is otherwise rarely advisable.

In patients with WPW syndrome that is producing lifethreatening arrhythmia, the accessory conduction pathways should be divided or ablated, and the valve defect should be treated concomitantly on its merits.S7 Atrial communications should be closed at the time of accessory pathways division. Other arrhythmias are not an indication for operation, because their occurrence is not altered by correction of the valve defect. However, they are undoubtedly less well tolerated in the presence of severe tricuspid regurgitation,

ASD repair alone was performed in eight; ASD and VSD repair in one; ASD repair and pulmonary valvotomy in one; ASD repair in patient with suspected myxoma in one. One patient with ASD repair and tricuspid valvotomy, not included in this table, died 2 weeks after hospital discharge. Bidirectional, but dominantly R → L.

# SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

## Morphology

Confusion as to morphologic classification has arisen in some infants who have pulmonary atresia and minor downward displacement (or adherence) of the septal tricuspid leaflet origin (see Chapter 40).B8 When this is the only Ebstein-like leaflet abnormality present, the defect is not classified or treated as Ebstein anomaly. In a number of infants with pulmonary atresia, however, the tricuspid valve shows additional typical and often florid features of Ebstein anomaly in association with severe regurgitation. Such patients form one variety of complex Ebstein anomaly.

## Management of Critically Ill Neonates with Ebstein Anomaly

When neonates with Ebstein anomaly present with severe cyanosis, prostaglandin infusion is initiated to maintain or restore ductal patency. Urgent echocardiographic evaluation is performed to establish the diagnosis and evaluate the RV outflow tract. If antegrade flow through the pulmonary valve is absent, the pulmonary atresia may be functional (elevated pulmonary vascular resistance coupled with severe tricuspid regurgitation and RV dysfunction) or anatomic.J1 A trial of inhaled nitric oxide is warranted to lower pulmonary vascular resistance and promote antegrade flow through the pulmonary valve if it is patent.J1 If nitric oxide is helpful in bridging a marginal patient through the neonatal period, the addition of oral sildenafil may be useful.P2 Other standard measures for critical ill neonates with Ebstein anomaly include placement of umbilical arterial and venous catheters and mechanical ventilation with the minimum effective airway pressure and tidal volumes of 10 to 15 mL · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> to recruit areas of atelectasis.K7,K9 If the RV outflow tract is functional, a trial of prostaglandin weaning is indicated. If SaO2 is maintained at 70% or greater without heart failure, surgical intervention may not be necessary.

If prostaglandin weaning is not successful, two situations may occur. If the circulation is stable without evidence of heart failure and the only problem is unacceptable cyanosis, a systemic-to–pulmonary shunt may be the only necessary procedure. However, if heart failure and circulatory compromise persist, the tricuspid valve itself must be addressed, either through the Starnes procedure or valve reconstruction (see Technique of Operation).

In planning for continued medical therapy vs. the likelihood of needing surgical intervention, calculation of the Celermajer scoreC6 is useful in predicting risk of death (see Table 42-2).

### Type of Prosthesis for Tricuspid Valve Replacement

A stent-mounted glutaraldehyde-preserved porcine bioprosthesis or bovine pericardial bioprosthesis may be considered optimal in most patients with Ebstein anomaly, but both are subject to the usual problems of a bioprosthesis.W3 Mechanical prostheses may also be used to achieve long-term durability, but anticoagulant therapy is required.C7 An analysis of the Mayo Clinic experience identified use of a bioprosthetic valve (vs. mechanical prosthetic valve) as an independent predictor of long-term survival.B15,N2 An allograft, either a stent-mounted pulmonary or aortic valve, or a directly attached mitral allograft supported by an anuloplasty ring, could also be considered.A1,M11

## Indications for Plication (or Resection) of Atrialized Ventricle

Indications for plication of an atrialized ventricle at the time of tricuspid valve replacement are controversial. Potential *advantages* of plication (or resection) include (1) reducing the size of the nonfunctional RV, potentially increasing transit of blood by improved systolic function; (2) improving left ventricular function by alleviating left ventricular compression and septal bowing; (3) moving the anterior leaflet closer to the septum by elevating the papillary muscles; and (4) providing more space for lung expansion, especially in neonates. The major potential disadvantage relates to possible distortion of or injury to the right coronary artery and its branches, which could worsen RV function and contribute to ventricular arrhythmias.B14 Some suggest that omitting routine plication compromises RV function postoperativelyH2,T6; others believe that plication is indicated only when the atrialized portion of the RV is very thin walled and aneurysmal (probably about 10% to 15% of cases).K6,N3,P1 Plication may be considered unnecessary in even these cases, because good function has resulted without it.C2,C8,W2

Plication of the atrialized ventricle is performed routinely in some methods of tricuspid valve repair, for which it is an integral part of the anuloplasty portion of the repair. However, several reported techniques emphasize the need for only partial plication near the functional anulusM3 as part of the anuloplasty procedure, without need to plicate the remainder of the atrialized portion.

## Excision or Plication of Right Atrial Wall

Excision or plication of the right atrial wall was suggested by Timmis and colleagues, who considered it important "to promote atrial emptying and lessen the likelihood of clot formation" when a mechanical prosthesis was used.T6 Danielson and colleagues incorporate excision of the right atrial wall in their repair.D6,M10 The simplicity of this maneuver during valve replacement or repair makes it an attractive step when the right atrium is markedly enlarged.

### Role of Bidirectional Cavopulmonary Shunt and One-and-a-Half Ventricle Repair

The vast majority of patients with Ebstein anomaly can undergo successful biventricular repair. However, creating a "one-and-a-half" ventricle repair can be an effective strategy if reducing the tricuspid anulus to a *z* value of less than −2 (or about 2.5 cm in the adult) is necessary to eliminate important tricuspid regurgitation in an infant or child with normal pulmonary vascular resistance. In this instance, functional tricuspid stenosis is managed by constructing a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt with division of the superior vena cava at its junction with the right atrium (see Chapter 41).M3 This strategy may also be useful when the RV is severely dysfunctional,Q2 as long as the left atrial and pulmonary artery pressures are low. By reducing the RV stroke volume required to maintain effective cardiac output, RV work requirement is reduced and preload of the left ventricle optimized.M3 Furthermore, the adverse effect on left ventricular function by a massively enlarged RV can be ameliorated.D12 Bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt may also reduce residual tricuspid regurgitation.M5 Dearani and colleagues have recommended the following criteria for constructing a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt: left ventricular end-diastolic pressure less than 15 mmHg, transpulmonary gradient less than 10 mmHg, and mean pulmonary artery pressure less than 18 to 20 mmHg.D12 Malhotra and colleaguesM3 recommend performing a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt if, at the end of the repair, right atrial pressure is more than 1.5 times left atrial pressure.

The potential disadvantages of this approach include possible facial suffusion secondary to elevated jugular venous pressure and pulsations in the head and neck veins, development of collateral veins and pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas, and compromise of access for pacemaker leads.

Malhotra and colleaguesM3 reported an experience of valve repair in 54 of 57 patients with Ebstein anomaly, of whom 55% received a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt (half of these in adults). Freedom from subsequent valve replacement was 92% at 4 years, with 95% of patients in NYHA class I. Van Arsdell and colleagues reported 90% 10-year survival following one-and-a-half ventricle repair.V2

# Indications for Single-Ventricle Pathway

The potential advantages of RV exclusion (Starnes procedure) for severely ill neonates with Ebstein anomaly are discussed under "Survival" in Results after Repair. Such patients, if they survive the initial neonatal procedure, have a high likelihood of survival through the bidirectional Glenn stage.

A particularly high-risk morphologic subset of Ebstein anomaly is hearts with the combination of severe tricuspid regurgitation and anatomic pulmonary atresia.K8,R4 Symptomatic infants and children with this combination are likely best treated with a single-ventricle strategy. Polimenakos and colleagues have also applied this strategy successfully in an adult Ebstein patient with severe RV dysfunction, tricuspid regurgitation, and RV outflow obstruction.P4
