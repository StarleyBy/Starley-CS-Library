Cardiomyopathy is a cardiac muscle disease process that leads to clinical myocardial dysfunction. The disease process results in morphologic changes in the heart that are typically classified as (1) dilated cardiomyopathy, (2) ischemic cardiomyopathy,F2,F4,P2,P7,S3,Y1 (3) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, (4) restrictive cardiomyopathy, and (5) arrhythmogenic right ventricular (RV) dysplasia. Clinical manifestations, predictors of survival and functional outcome, and therapeutic objectives focus on the clinical and pathophysiologic condition termed *heart failure*.

# **Section I Heart Failure**

# DEFINITION

Heart failure is a clinical syndrome that represents a complication or common final pathway of many heart diseases in which defective cardiac filling (diastolic heart failure) or impaired contraction (systolic heart failure) or emptying results in the heart's inability to pump a sufficient amount of blood to support tissue metabolism, or to be able to do so only with elevated filling pressures. It is commonly characterized by secondary organ abnormalities in the skeletal muscles (fatigue), lungs (dyspnea on exertion and sometimes at rest), and kidneys (salt and fluid retention).

# HISTORICAL NOTE

William Withering drew attention to the use of foxglove, *Digitalis purpurea,* in his classic treatise *An Account of the Foxglove and Some of Its Medical Uses: With Practical Remarks on Dropsy and Other Diseases* in l785.W5 He began using an old family remedy for dropsy—swelling of the limbs—and determined that the active ingredient of the herbal concoction was derived from foxglove leaves. After 10 years' experience, he published use of digitalis in treating dropsy, anasarca, and hydrops pectoris. Withering advised digitalis primarily as a diuretic, assuming this was its principal action. He also recognized a powerful action on the heart, quieting and slowing its rate. Cushny, writing about digitalis in 1925, noted that much literature was published regarding its actions until 1810C13; thereafter, clinical use of digitalis remained unchanged for 100 years.

William Heberden, writing in 1802 about diagnosis and treatment of dropsy, stated "A dropsy is very rarely an original distemper, but is generally a symptom of some other, which is too often incurable; and hence arises its extreme danger."H5 He recommended removing "stagnating water" by purging and diuretic salts. He knew of digitalis and used it in his practice.

Bertin made an important distinction in 1833 between hypertrophy and dilatation of the heart.B9 He noted that dilatation does not constantly accompany thickening (hypertrophy) of the myocardium. He proposed classifying hypertrophy using "simple" to describe a heart whose walls were thickened without dilatation of chambers, "eccentric" to describe increased wall thickness with dilatation of chambers, and "concentric" to describe increased wall thickness and diminished cavity size.

In 1870, J. Milner Fothergill won the Hastings Gold Medal of the British Medical Association for an essay about digitalis. His text on heart disease and treatment provides a glimpse of heart failure treatment in 1872.F5 He stated, "The treatment of [cardiac] dilatation taxes all the powers that can be brought to bear on it, and the success which attends our efforts is very limited indeed." He recommended "rest, nutritious and easily-digestible diet, … and a residence in a hospital ward for a few weeks." In addition to rest and abstaining from all exertion, he recommended treatment with digitalis.

When William Osler published *The Principles and Practice of Medicine* in 1892,O3 treatment of heart failure included "complete bed rest, a carefully regulated diet, and use of aromatic spirits of ammonia, sulphuric ether, and stimulants." Digitalis was used more selectively. "Morphia" (morphine) was used. Even "strychnia" (strychnine) was given. Cautious use of nitroglycerine was also recommended.

Understanding of heart failure advanced in the 20th century. Paul D. White used the term *congestive heart failure* to refer to insufficiency of the myocardium in his classic text *Heart Disease,* published in 1931.W3 Mechanisms and causes of heart failure became more refined. Treatment consisted of:

- Rest
- Digitalis
- Diuretic drug therapy
- Other drugs, including cathartics and hypnotics
- Other measures, including venesection

Diuretics that were useful at that time were theobromine, mercury, certain salts, and parathormone.

By the I950s, rapid advances were being made in treating diseases of the circulation.H1 Heart failure treatment included not only rest but intermittent exercise to prevent phlebothrombosis and enhance efficacy of diuretic therapy. Dietary sodium restriction was understood. Digitalis was available as powdered leaf and in several purified compounds and was the mainstay of heart failure treatment. Mercurial diuretics were the most effective. These drugs were given parenterally and acted by diminishing reabsorption of chloride by the renal tubules. Their action was enhanced by intravenous administration of aminophylline. Chlorothiazide became available for oral use and was thought to be an effective diuretic. Oxygen therapy was found to be useful. Other measures were still in use, such as sedation with morphine, venesection, thoracentesis, puncture of legs, and radioiodine to induce hypothyroidism.

Loop diuretics were introduced in the late 1960s.K3,K4 For the first time, efficacious diuretic agents were available. Ethacrynic acid, the first of the loop diuretics, is a phenoxyacetic acid derivative; furosemide is a sulfonamide derivative. These drugs selectively inhibit sodium chloride reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Other sulfonamide derivatives were subsequently introduced. These diuretics have become the basis for treating heart failure.

# MORPHOLOGY AND MORPHOGENESIS

#### Cardiac Remodeling

Cardiac remodeling is the central feature of the failing heart. One of the principal mechanisms by which the heart compensates for increased load is ventricular hypertrophy.C9 The basic cellular feature of cardiac remodeling is myocyte hypertrophy, which includes both an increase in myocyte size and presence of additional sarcomeres, whose qualitative aspects differ according to the inciting pathologic conditions. Early stages of myocardial hypertrophy are characterized by increases in number and size of mitochondria in cardiac myocytes and in number of myofibrils.F3 The myocardial cell, therefore, is larger and longer.

Transition from compensatory hypertrophy to heart failure is related to alterations in cell organization and changes in coronary blood flow to the increased cell mass of the hypertrophied ventricle. Myocardial capillary density and coronary reserve are reduced,V3 resulting in myocardial ischemia that is most pronounced in the subendocardium. Ischemic myocyte injury associated with replacement fibrosis impairs systolic and diastolic function and accelerates heart failure. At a more advanced stage of hypertrophy, subtle changes of cellular organization and contour occur. Long-standing hypertrophy disrupts both cellular organization and Z-band architecture. Late stages of hypertrophy are characterized by loss of contractile elements with breakdown of Z bands, loss of normal parallel arrangement of sarcomeres, deposition of fibrous tissue, and tortuosity of T tubules.

When the remodeling process leads to segmental or global ventricular dilatation, the increased curvature results in increased wall tension, as predicted by the Laplace relationship. Increased wall tension induces increased myocardial oxygen consumption, impairs subendocardial blood flow, and decreases arrhythmia thresholds. Increasing degree of remodeling has been correlated with worsening prognosis.C9

# Fetal Gene Activation

Growth factors present in the embryonic heart but dormant in the normal adult heart are reactivated by myocyte hypertrophy.K2 In the embryonic heart, growth factors provide the stimulus for normal cell division and heart growth. Withdrawal of growth factors inhibits the cell cycle and favors repair in the normal adult heart. The fetal gene repertoire responds to myocyte hypertrophy with induction of β-myosin heavy chain (MHC), atrial natriuretic factor, and repression of α-MHC, among others. Loss of α-MHC content contributes directly to reduced contractility in heart failure. Excitation-contraction coupling is compromised by alterations in the phosphorylation status of troponin-I; and defects in calcium ATPase and calcium release channels impair contractility and promote β-adrenergic desensitization.C2

The environment of continuous growth signals promoted by the fetal gene profile produces cell dysfunction and eventually cell death, likely related to apoptotic mechanisms. Alterations in the extracellular matrix of the myocardium include replacement fibrosis.

# CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

#### Pathophysiology

Heart failure begins after an event produces an initial decline in pumping capacity of the heart. Once the injurious event is initiated, three major forces can contribute to chronic heart failure: intrinsic myocardial damage, abnormal load on one or both ventricles, and extrinsic forces.

The major causes of intrinsic myocardial damage include myocardial infarction secondary to ischemic heart disease, inherited conditions that affect the contractile apparatus, infiltrative myocardial diseases, autoantibodies against myocardial antigens, autoimmune injury, infection, metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hyperthyroidism), and toxic agents (e.g., alcohol, certain chemotherapeutic agents).C2,Z1 Abnormal loading conditions may result from chronic pressure overload (e.g., chronic hypertension, aortic stenosis) or volume overload (e.g., mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation, intracardiac shunts, extracardiac fistulae between arterial and venous circulations). Extrinsic forces include constrictive pericarditis, severe anemia, and substrate-inducing chronic tachycardia.

These conditions initially evoke a variety of compensatory mechanisms that, in the short term, restore cardiovascular function to a normal homeostatic range in which the patient is asymptomatic.M2 Such compensation is termed *adaptive*. Over time, however, sustained activation of these compensatory systems becomes *maladaptive* and can lead to secondary damage of ventricular myocardium, worsening ventricular remodeling, and eventually cardiac decompensation and death. Changes in configuration of the ventricular chamber that are also detrimental to cardiac function include dilatation, change in shape (increased sphericity), thinning of the wall, and inflow valve regurgitation.

## Cardiorenal-Hemodynamic Mechanisms

A common early manifestation of heart failure is excessive salt and water retention resulting from abnormalities of renal blood flow attending reduction of cardiac output and vasoconstriction. Sympathetic nervous system up-regulation increases cardiac afterload and heart rate and decreases renal perfusion. Reduced renal perfusion alerts receptors in renal arterioles, activating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.M2 Renal and tissue renin stimulates production of angiotensin I. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) catalyzes conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II and aldosterone blood levels are increased, causing vasoconstriction and retention of salt and water. Angiotensin II induces vasoconstriction of efferent arterioles, increasing glomerular filtration pressure despite reduced renal blood flow. This increase in sympathetic activity is initially compensatory for reduction in renal blood flow, but over time becomes maladaptive, accelerating cardiac remodeling.A6,B1,B2,C2,D1,G1,H9,K5,K7,M7,Z1

#### Neurohormonal Mechanisms

As cardiac output and tissue perfusion are reduced, complex neurohormonal responses are evoked for maintaining arterial perfusion (Fig. 20-1). This compensatory (adaptive) mechanism is initially beneficial in maintaining tissue perfusion as cardiac output declines, but the process actually increases hemodynamic burden and oxygen requirements of the heart, eventually becoming detrimental (maladaptive). Circulating levels of norepinephrine may be markedly increased, and there is increased activity of adrenergic neurons that cause vasoconstriction and increase afterload of the failing ventricle. Over time, density of adrenergic receptors and concentration of norepinephrine in the myocardium are reduced. These changes are accompanied by reduced activity of adenylate cyclase, which lowers intracellular concentrations

of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and reduces activation of protein kinase, affecting phosphorylation of Ca++ channels and decreasing transsarcolemmal Ca++ entry, thereby depressing cellular uptake of Ca++ . The result is depression of the myocardial force-velocity relationship and the length–active tension curve, which reduces the myocardial contractile state.

Cardiac output is maintained by increased end-diastolic fiber length and elevation of ventricular end-diastolic volume (Frank-Starling mechanism). Initial improvement of contractility associated with increased norepinephrine is eventually attenuated or prevented by norepinephrine depletion or down-regulation of myocardial norepinephrine receptors. Eventually, myocardial damage is progressive, ventricular failure intensifies, and death ensues.

Heart failure may progress as a result of overexpression of compensatory biologically active molecules that exert toxic effects on the myocardium.T1 A variety of molecules have been implicated as sufficiently toxic to contribute to heart failure,M2 including norepinephrine, angiotensin II, endothelin, aldosterone, and tumor necrosis factor. These molecules are of neuroendocrine origin, but may also be produced by a variety of cell types within the heart, including the myocyte itself.

#### Symptoms and Signs

Heart failure can be an acute decompensation or a chronic progressive disease. It is usually associated with decline in

#### **Box 20-1** Stages of Heart Failure

## **Stage A**

High risk for developing heart failure, but with no structural disorder of the heart (hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, rheumatic fever, personal history, family history of cardiomyopathy)

#### **Stage B**

Structural disorder of the heart with no signs or symptoms of heart failure (left ventricular hypertrophy, dilatation or hypocontractility, valvar disease, myocardial infarction)

#### **Stage C**

Past or current symptoms of heart failure associated with underlying structural heart disease (dyspnea or fatigue or asymptomatic patient treated for prior symptomatic heart failure)

#### **Stage D**

Advanced disease requiring continuous or frequent hospitalization or specialized treatment strategies such as mechanical circulatory support, continuous inotropic infusions, cardiac transplantation, or hospice care

cardiac output. The consequence of elevated left ventricular (LV) preload and pulmonary capillary pressure is dyspnea.K9 Cardiac remodeling is generally accepted as a determinant of the clinical course of heart failure.C10 An approach to classification has been proposed that reflects the progressive nature of the clinical syndrome.H9

Evolution of the disease is identified by four stages of heart failure (Box 20-1). This classification complements the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification, which gauges severity of symptoms primarily in stages B and C. The classification suggests that patients with heart failure are expected to advance from one stage to the next unless progression of the disease is slowed or stopped by treatment.

# NATURAL HISTORY

Heart failure is estimated to affect more than 5 million people in the United States alone and accounts for 1 to 3 million hospitalizations per year, or about 5% to 10% of all hospital admissions.A7 The number of individuals with heart failure is increasing, with 400,000 to 700,000 new cases diagnosed each year, and the frequency is expected to increase two to three times during the next decade. About 3% of the adult population is treated for heart failure. Occurrence of heart failure increases with age; 6% to 10% of people older than age 65 are affected, and it is the most common cardiac diagnosis in this patient population.

Heart failure results in nearly 300,000 deaths per year in the United States, 60% sudden. Sudden death may be completely unexpected (one third of patients), a consequence of rapid deterioration (one third of patients), or a result of progression of chronic heart failure (one third of patients).N1 About one third of patients die within 1 year of initial heart failure diagnosis, with nearly 80% dead within 6 years.R3

Cost of treating patients with heart failure is enormous, estimated at more than \$40 billion per year, or more than 5% of the healthcare budget.H9 Of that total, about \$20 billion goes directly for medical costs, \$500 million of which is spent on drugs for treating heart failure.

## TREATMENT OF HEART FAILURE

When a specific treatable medical disorder is responsible for heart failure, specific treatment of the underlying condition is a critical component of initial therapy (see Section VII).

# Pharmacologic Therapy

Standard guidelines for evaluating and treating heart failure have been published.H9 A fundamental goal is to slow or reverse ventricular remodeling. Intense medical therapy, which has evolved over the last 20 years, demonstrably improves survival. ACE inhibitors, new-generation β-blockers, and aldosterone improve survival, attributed in part to their reverse remodeling effects.A4,A8,E1,K6,K9,P6,R1,T2,W2

Current treatment of heart failure, based on various pathophysiologic theories, recognizes that no single model explains all aspects of the heart failure syndrome and therefore attempts to use all clinical models to develop effective therapeutic strategies.H9,M2 Most patients with symptomatic LV dysfunction should be routinely managed with a combination of four categories of drugs: a diuretic, an ACE inhibitor, a β-adrenergic blocker, and digitalis.H9 Diuretics and spironolactone are used to treat congestion and fluid retention related to cardiorenal mechanisms. Short-term intravenous inotropic support, intravenous vasodilators, or both, are used to treat cardiocirculatory mechanisms. Long-term inotropic support is achieved using digoxin.A3,T3 Intermediate and long-term strategies are directed at neurohormonal mechanisms using carvedilol,P1 a β1-, β2-blocker with antioxidant properties, and ACE inhibitors. When ACE inhibitors are not tolerated, angiotensin receptor blockers may be effective.J5

#### Pacing Therapy for Conduction Abnormalities

Worsening of LV systolic function is frequently accompanied by impaired electromechanical coupling, which further diminishes systolic function. About 20% to 30% of patients with symptomatic heart failure have a prolonged P-R interval or an intraventricular conduction disorder characterized by wide QRS (left bundle branch block) and a discoordinate contraction pattern. Prolonged P-R interval may result in early contraction of the atria and mitral regurgitation during the diastolic phase, reducing ventricular filling. Proper timing of the P wave relative to mitral valve closure by cardiac pacing may provide more appropriate ventricular filling time.

Prolonged QRS and delay of conduction may result in contraction of the base of the heart well in advance of the LV lateral wall and apex. This may cause paradoxical septal motion and mitral valve regurgitation. Biventricular pacing (also termed *cardiac resynchronization therapy*) allows simultaneous electrical stimulation of the RV and LV using an implantable pacing system. A discoordinate contraction pattern of the ventricles may be resynchronized by pacing the lateral wall of the LV synchronous with pacing the apex of the RV. Optimal aortic pulse pressure occurs when the peak of left atrial pressure coincides with start of the LV contraction as a result of optimal preload mechanisms. In addition to optimizing left atrial–to-LV mechanical timing, favorable response to both LV and biventricular stimulation may result from improved synchrony of RV and LV contraction.A10

# Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Therapy

In patients with advanced heart failure, the potential for fatal ventricular arrhythmias has prompted consideration of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy over chronic anti-arrhythmia drugs.

# RESULTS

# Pharmacologic Therapy

The effect of various therapeutic interventions has been evaluated in a number of clinical trials in patients with LV systolic dysfunction. Both ACE inhibitors and β-blockers, acting individually or synergistically, reduce morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients treated with diuretics and digoxin. Agents such as ACE inhibitors that inhibit neurohormonal activation relieve symptoms, reduce hospitalizations, and prolong survival.P1 An increasing dose of ACE inhibitor or adding spironolactone to an ACE inhibitor may further improve prognosis. The optimal dose of β-blockers is unknown. Digoxin continues to be a mainstay of heart failure treatment and has been shown to decrease heart failure– related hospitalizations, but there is no evidence that it decreases mortality. It is not known whether digoxin is effective when added to a β-blocker.

# Pacing Therapy for Conduction Abnormalities

Shortening of the P-R interval correlates with improved functional class and increased oxygen consumption.A5 Resynchronization therapy with biventricular pacing has been shown to improve symptoms in patients with moderate to advanced heart failure.A1,C3 Several randomized multicenter trials have examined its effects on functional status, quality of life, and hemodynamics in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. These studies have demonstrated clinical improvement correlated with narrowing of the paced QRS complex, decrease in interventricular conduction delay, and a trend toward increase in duration of ventricular filling.G5,S2 Clinical benefits appear to be maintained over 12 months in patients with both sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation.L1,L4 Biventricular pacing incorporating antitachycardia options or an ICD appear to be the future direction of pacing therapy.S13

Large prospective, randomized multicenter trials have identified patient populations for whom ICD therapy provides survival benefit even in the absence of prior cardiac arrest or sustained ventricular tachycardia.E2

# **Section II Dilated Cardiomyopathy**

#### DEFINITION

Dilated cardiomyopathy is a cardiac muscle disease characterized by enlargement of one or both ventricles and impairment of at least systolic function.R2 It may be considered the final outcome pathway of a variety of causes of myocardial insult. These include coronary artery disease (see Chapter 10), infectious etiologies (most commonly viral), toxic substances (e.g., alcohol), certain medications, familial cardiomyopathy, inherited disorders, pregnancy, long-standing supraventricular tachycardias, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, and other rare causes (see Section VII). In most patients, the causative factor is never identified (*idiopathic cardiomyopathy*).I2

# HISTORICAL NOTE

# Cardiac Transplantation and Mechanical Circulatory Support

The historical development of cardiac transplantation and mechanical circulatory support for treating dilated cardiomyopathy and other cardiomyopathies are detailed under Historical Note in Chapters 21 and 22.

# Mitral Valve Repair

In an earlier era of cardiac surgery (1980s and early 1990s), mitral valve surgery was generally considered ill advised for patients with severe mitral regurgitation in the setting of markedly depressed LV function. It was hypothesized that the sudden increase in ventricular afterload by transforming a regurgitant mitral valve into a competent one would induce acute failure of an already dysfunctional LV. Over the last 15 years, results of mitral valve repair or replacement in this setting have progressively improved.

## Partial Left Ventriculectomy

In 1996, Batista introduced the concept of surgically reversing the remodeling process in dilated cardiomyopathy with a procedure termed *partial left ventriculectomy*. B4 The basis for the operation was the Laplace law, which relates wall tension to chamber radius. It was reasoned that reduction of LV size would improve cardiac function. Theoretically, reduction in LV volume reduces wall tension and improves contractility, with restoration of a more normal volume/mass relationship.B5,J1,M10,S4 Initially, only LV posterior wall was removed. Later, resection was sometimes extended to include the papillary muscles and mitral valve.

Although it is true that reducing chamber radius will reduce wall stress for a given pressure, it is not obvious from this explanation alone that volume reduction will increase the heart's pumping capacity.A9 The potential limitation of this procedure is that it removes functioning, though weakened, myocardium. Systolic wall stress is reduced, and LVEF may improve with reduction of ventricular chamber radius, but it may be associated with a deleterious effect on diastolic compliance that neutralizes any beneficial effect and may actually reduce net ventricular pumping capacity.

#### Alternative Therapies

## *Dynamic Cardiomyoplasty*

Dynamic cardiomyoplasty is use of an electrically stimulated skeletal muscle that is wrapped around part of the heart to augment or restore contractility of the ventricles. It was introduced experimentally by Kantrowitz and McKinnon in 1959 and developed for use in humans by Carpentier and Chachques in 1958.C1,H3

## *Ventricular Shape Change and Constraint Devices*

Chaudhry and colleagues used a prosthetic jacket of knitted polyester mesh to provide passive LV constraint in a canine heart-failure model produced by intracoronary microembolization.C5 The prosthetic jacket prevented progressive LV remodeling and abolished functional mitral valve regurgitation. This led to the Acorn Cardiac Support Device (Fig. 20-2) for use in humans (Acorn Cardiovascular, St. Paul, Minn.).

#### *Direct Cardiac or Aortic Compression Devices*

Devices to assist the failing heart by direct compression of the heart (to shift end-systolic pressure–volume relationship) or aorta have been designed to avoid blood–foreign surface interaction of the assist device.F6,O4,S1

![](_page_7_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 20-2** Acorn Cardiac Support Device.

# MORPHOLOGY

The primary morphologic characteristic is enlargement (increased volume) of the ventricles and, to a lesser extent, the atria. A variable degree of hypertrophy is often present. Microscopic examination demonstrates extensive interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, occasionally with calcification, in the ventricular myocardium. Myocardial cell degeneration is usually seen.S5

Considerable evidence supports the notion that chronic severe mitral regurgitation is an additive insult to the damage of ventricular remodeling. Furthermore, some studies suggest an organic contribution to the functional mitral regurgitation of advanced heart failure. In studies by Grande-Allen and colleagues,G4 the mitral valve exposed to chronically increased ventricular stress demonstrates increased collagen synthesis, producing increased valve stiffness, resulting in a valve that cannot distend sufficiently in the radial direction to cover the valve orifice in the presence of heart failure–induced anular dilatation. Increased stiffness and reduced extensibility increase valve stresses and reduce coaptation, leading to progressive mitral regurgitation. Several studies have indicated a deleterious effect of chronic severe mitral regurgitation on midterm survival in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.B10,J6

# CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

The specific diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy usually cannot be made by endocardial biopsy. There has been considerable speculation as to the possible progression of infective (particularly viral) myocarditis to dilated cardiomyopathy. Such progression may be especially frequent in children.G2 Alcoholism, pregnancy, and systemic hypertension may provide a background for its development.

Less than 25% of patients have familial disease.M1 Several families have been described in which some members have dilated cardiomyopathy, and in some of these the inheritance is X-linked.B8 In these, onset seems to be early (second and third decades) in men and late (sixth decade) in women. Most asymptomatic relatives of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and LV enlargement have histopathologic and immunopathologic findings similar to those of patients with established disease.M1,M6

Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized pathophysiologically by impaired ventricular systolic function.B14,B15,B16,G3 However, particularly late in the disease, decreased LV compliance may develop. Both end-diastolic and end-systolic ventricular volumes are increased.

All forms of cardiomyopathy may have a nonspecific prodromal phase lasting weeks or months that suggests an infectious process.K11 Then symptoms of left, right, or biventricular failure develop and progress to chronic heart failure.S6

#### Chest Radiography

Chest radiography may be normal or show cardiomegaly, which can be extreme.

#### Two-Dimensional Echocardiography

Two-dimensional echocardiography has become standard for evaluating ventricular function.B6,J3,L3 It is excellent for diagnosing systolic dysfunction characterized by segmental or global reduction of systolic wall motion. As many as one third of patients with heart failure, however, have normal systolic function. This implicates diastolic dysfunction as a major pathophysiologic abnormality in these patients. Doppler color flow interrogation is a practical, noninvasive method for diagnosing and following patients with diastolic dysfunction.N2 Methods used to evaluate it are based on analysis and interpretation of flow velocity across the mitral valve.

#### Cardiac Catheterization

Cardiac catheterization usually reveals nonspecific findings. Right, left, or biventricular ejection fractions are reduced, and the diastolic pressure contour often has the *square root sign* characteristic of pericardial constriction. Endomyocardial biopsy may be useful in excluding other conditions in patients believed to have dilated cardiomyopathy. However, positive diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy from biopsy is rarely possible.O2

## NATURAL HISTORY

Approximately 5 to 8 of every 1,000,000 people are diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy each year. It can develop at any age but is more common among patients aged 20 to 60 years. Some 10% of patients are diagnosed after age 65. It occurs three times more frequently in males and blacks than in females and whites. About 80% of patients are dead within 10 years of onset.F11 Despite heterogeneity of its etiology, there is considerable correspondence among different estimates of survival with this condition.

The course is variable, with some patients dying within 1 to 2 years of the evident onset of disease; a few have an even

**Figure 20-3** Abnormal separation of papillary muscles as a cause of mitral regurgitation in dilated cardiomyopathy.

more fulminating course. Cardiac autoantibodies may play a functional role, and their removal may induce hemodynamic improvement.F1 A few patients recover spontaneously, most commonly when cardiomyopathy is related to acute myocarditis. Spontaneous recovery is increasingly recognized following prolonged periods of support with LV assist devices (LVAD; see Chapter 22).H8

Mode of death is usually chronic cardiac failure. Occasionally, death is due to intractable ventricular arrhythmias and sometimes is sudden (see Section I).M9 Important risk factors for death include marked cardiomegaly, ventricular arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension, and elevated right atrial pressure.I2,M19,U1

Thromboembolism is particularly common when the LV is greatly dilated and in patients with atrial fibrillation.

# TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

# Cardiac Transplantation

Cardiac transplantation is widely used as a treatment for endstage dilated cardiomyopathy. Technique of operation is described in Chapter 21.

#### Mitral Valve Repair

Mitral regurgitation in cardiomyopathy has two major mechanistic components: anular dilatationM17 as part of overall LV enlargement, and abnormal separation of the papillary musclesK10,M11,M12 (Fig. 20-3). Details of mitral anuloplastyH6 and management of the subvalvar apparatus are discussed in Chapters 10 and 11.

#### Partial Left Ventriculectomy

Partial left ventriculectomy consists of full-thickness LV freewall resection between the papillary muscles, extending from the mitral anulus to LV apex. In the presence of mitral regurgitation, the mitral valve is repaired or replaced, usually through the ventriculectomy incision.

#### Alternative Therapies

#### *Dynamic Cardiomyoplasty*

The latissimus dorsi muscle is transferred as a muscle flap through a window in the chest wall made by partial removal of a rib.C4 It is used as a wrap around the heart for reinforcement or as a substitute for a defect in the ventricular wall. Electrodes are implanted on the muscle flap and connected to an electrical stimulator, which paces contractions synchronously with myocardial contraction.

A variation of dynamic cardiomyoplasty is an auxiliary blood pump formed from a pedicled graft of latissimus dorsi muscle (skeletal muscle ventricle) connected to the circulation in a cardiac assist configuration. It has shown some promise in experimental heart failure.K1,T4 Adaptive conditioning by electrical stimulation enables the skeletal muscle to perform a portion of cardiac work without fatigue. Such skeletal muscle pumps have been able to maintain blood pressure greater than 80 mmHg for up to 4 years in dogs, without compromising viability of the working muscle. Although this work is experimental, clinical application for cardiac assist may eventually become feasible.

#### *Ventricular Shape Change and Constraint Devices*

The LV is a conical structure, whereas the RV is a crescentshaped chamber wrapped to the right side of the LV. In the presence of systolic heart failure, progressive ventricular enlargement distorts the normal shape as well as the Frank-Starling pressure-volume relationship.F8,P4 The dilated ventricle also increases wall stress based on the Laplace law relating radius, pressure, and wall tension. All these pathologic phenomena could theoretically be abated by surgical techniquesJ4 or devices that prevent further ventricular enlargement.

Animal studies showing that native pericardium provides constraint to deformation of the ventriclesF10 provided the physiologic concept behind cardiomyoplasty and passive ventricular constraint. Although dynamic cardiomyoplasty was originally touted as a procedure to augment systolic ventricular contraction, subsequent clinical studies demonstrated that the constraining effect of the muscle wrap was the primary beneficial effect.K1 In the late 1990s, application of the cardiac constraining principle stimulated development of multiple devices designed to change LV shape or restrain ventricular dilatation in heart failure.

# *Direct Cardiac or Aortic Compression Devices*

Direct cardiac or aortic compression devices have the advantages of simplicity of application during unstable circulatory conditions and ease of removal after recovery from heart failure or at transplantation. The CardioSupport system (Cardio Technologies Inc., Pine Brook, N.J.) is a cufflike structure that surrounds both ventricles from apex to atrioventricular groove. It is applied under negative pressure (−200 mmHg) to provide a vacuum seal. Compression bladders are inflated and deflated in synchrony with cardiac contraction, timed from epicardial electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes.

The Heart Booster (Abiomed, Danvers, Mass.) is a cufflike device consisting of several parallel compression tubes covering both ventricles and held in place with surgical adhesive. A hydraulic drive system fills and empties the compression tubes. Both of these compression systems are in the development phase.

The Kantrowitz CardioVad (LVAD Technology Inc., Detroit, Mich.) is an experimental system operating on the principle of diastolic augmentation, like an intra-aortic balloon catheter and pump. The blood pump is an inflatable bladder sutured into the wall of the descending thoracic aorta via left thoracotomy, with the patient on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). There is direct blood contact with the textured surface of the inflatable bladder, which is expected to become covered with pseudoneointima. The pump is worn externally and provides a stroke volume of up to 60 mL via a transcutaneous tube.J2

The C-Pulse (Sunshine Heart Inc., Sydney, Australia) is a counterpulsation device that is wrapped externally around the ascending aorta, avoiding direct blood contact. The inflatable cuff and a sensing wire are attached to an external pneumatic driver that inflates and deflates the cuff in sequence with the ECG signal to provide timed counterpulsation. Implantation is performed via median sternotomy and does not require CPB. The system can be turned on and off by the patient as required. This device is intended for use in ambulatory patients with advanced NYHA class III or early class IV symptoms.

# RESULTS

#### Cardiac Transplantation

Results of transplantation are detailed in Chapter 21.

#### Mitral Valve Repair

Bolling and colleagues reported a hospital mortality of less than 2% and 1-year survival of 82% following mitral valve anuloplasty using an undersized flexible ring in the presence of severe LV systolic dysfunction, with preoperative LVEF ranging from 8% to 25%.B11 Patients experienced improved NYHA class, LVEF, and exercise oxygen consumption, and reduced end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes. Perhaps the most persuasive evidence supporting the safety of mitral valve repair or replacement in the setting of severely depressed LV function came as an offshoot of the multi-institutional ACORN trial for the Acorn cardiac constraining device.A2 One arm of the study included patients with poor ventricular function, dilated cardiomyopathy, and severe mitral regurgitation. Hospital mortality among patients undergoing mitral valve repair or replacement with or without a constraining device was 1.6%, and 12- and 24-month cumulative survival was 86% and 85%, respectively. Mitral valve surgery was associated with reduced LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, decreased LV mass, increased LVEF, and decreased sphericity. Postoperative functional mitral regurgitation remained stable over midterm follow-up, with more than 80% of patients having 0 or 1+ mitral regurgitation at 6 to 18 months.

These and other reports indicate that in the present era, with optimal myocardial protection and appropriate preoperative management of heart failure, patients can undergo mitral valve repair in the presence of severe LV dysfunction (LVEFs as low as 10%) with low anticipated hospital mortality. Nevertheless, long-term benefit remains controversial. A retrospective analysis by Wu and colleagues failed to demonstrate a survival benefit conferred by mitral valve anuloplasty.W6

#### Partial Left Ventriculectomy

Batista and colleagues reported clinical improvement following partial left ventriculectomy in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and advanced heart failure.B4 Batista was joined by other colleagues to report a combined series of patients having partial left ventriculectomy to treat advanced heart failure.B5 Although the procedure initially generated considerable enthusiasm as an alternative to cardiac transplantation, surgical mortality was considerably higher than after transplantation, and subsequent composite freedom from death, need for ventricular assist support, and cardiac transplantation was low at 2 years.F7,S12,S14 Franco-Cereceda and colleagues at Cleveland Clinic noted that perioperative mortality was low (3.2%; CL 1.0%-7.5% of 62 patients), but a ventricular assist device was required in 18% (CL 13%-24%) of cases; survival at 3 years was 64%.F7 LVEF showed only small initial improvement that declined with time, and failure (relisting for transplant, NYHA class IV symptoms, or death) was common (74%) during the first 3 years after operation.F7,M8,S12 The challenge in part appeared to be patient selection.

Frazier and colleagues reported a combined institutional series of 42 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy treated by partial left ventriculectomy.F9 Cardiac output and LVEF improved minimally. Changes in myocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis were postulated to be related to clinical results. Lundenheimer and colleaguesL6 showed the healed scar was 4 cm wide and reached 2 to 12 mm beyond the surgical suture line. In addition, myocardial fibers were misaligned. Konertz and colleagues reported 49 patients with 5 early deaths (10%; CL 6%-17%).K8 Functional improvement was better in patients with ischemic etiology (88% NYHA functional class I or II) than idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (56% NYHA class I or II). These authors proposed use of stress echocardiography to identify patients with segmental wall motion abnormalities who would be better treated by an infarct exclusion operation, reserving partial left ventriculectomy for patients with a global wall motion abnormality. They also proposed evaluating ventricular function in response to dobutamine infusion as a means of predicting improved function after partial ventriculectomy.

Thus, initial enthusiasm for partial left ventriculectomy was dampened by mixed results after operation, with a high prevalence of early failure.F7 Despite the lack of current interest in this procedure, good functional results can be obtained in some patients.

#### Alternative Therapies

# *Dynamic Cardiomyoplasty*

Long-term studies of patients having cardiomyoplasty have shown improvement in quality of life and functional class following dynamic cardiomyoplasty.B12 However, clinical improvement has not correlated with changes in LVEF or cardiac output.O1 Kass and colleagues suggested that benefits derived from cardiomyoplasty may be primarily due to passive constraint of the heart rather than to an active squeezing assist effect.K1 There have been late deaths from ventricular arrhythmias, mainly ventricular fibrillation, so antiarrhythmic drugs or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators are needed.B12 Consequently, dynamic cardiomyoplasty has not found a place in routine treatment of cardiac failure.

#### *Ventricular Shape Change and Constraint Devices*

In a multi-institutional randomized trial in the United States,M3 the Acorn Cardiac Support Device implanted via median sternotomy was compared with continued optimal medical therapy for patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and NYHA class III heart failure. Compared with the medical group, the cardiac support device group had greater reduction in LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes and greater improvement in LV sphericity and quality-of-life measures. Nevertheless, both groups had similar LVEFs, occurrence of repeat hospitalizations, and mortality.

Other constraining devices that have entered clinical trials, but without current U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, include the Myosplint device (Myocor, Maple Grove, Minn.), which alters the LV short axis into two bilobed spheres, producing a reduction in wall stress; and the Paracor device, a nitinol mesh coated with polyurethane that is slipped over the heart via a small thoracotomy.

#### *Direct Cardiac or Aortic Compression Devices*

The CardioSupport system, which provides epicardial compression, has been used in experimental animals for up to 7 days without adverse events.W4

Initial feasibility studies of the C-Pulse device in patients demonstrated predictable augmentation of coronary flow and reduction of LV afterload, decrease in heart failure symptoms, and improved cardiac performance.H4 A multicenter trial to assess safety and performance is in progress.

# INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

# Cardiac Transplantation

Indications for cardiac transplantation are presented in Chapter 21.

#### Mitral Valve Repair

Isolated mitral valve repair is not advisable in the setting of deteriorating cardiac performance requiring inotropic support or overt cardiogenic shock. A high operative mortality would be expected under these circumstances. These patients, if unresponsive to other measures, are better served by a strategy utilizing mechanical circulatory support (see Chapter 22) or cardiac transplantation (see Chapter 21).

In the absence of acute cardiac decompensation or chronic inotrope dependence, surgical mitral valve repair can be considered in patients who remain symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy when mitral regurgitation is severe. However, because long-term studies have not yet demonstrated a survival and functional benefit from mitral valve surgery in this setting, consensus has not been reached regarding specific patient subsets who should undergo mitral valve surgery. More routine application of mitral valve repair in dilated cardiomyopathy with severe mitral regurgitation will depend on demonstration of survival benefit, a more favorable functional outcome, evidence of sustained competence or near competence of the mitral valve, evidence of hemodynamic benefit, and reverse remodeling following repair.

# Partial Left Ventriculectomy

As originally described, partial left ventriculectomy was indicated for patients in NYHA class IV heart failure from dilated cardiomyopathy.B4 Currently, in countries where cardiac transplantation is available, this procedure has been largely abandoned. However, in countries or regions without access to these more complex and expensive therapies, this procedure may be advisable for patients with marked LV dilatation (end-diastolic dimension of 7 cm or more) and class IV heart failure despite optimal medical therapy.

# Alternative Therapies

# *Dynamic Cardiomyoplasty*

Dynamic cardiomyoplasty is not indicated for routine treatment of heart failure.

#### *Ventricular Shape Change and Constraint Devices*

To date, no ventricular constraining device has received FDA approval in the United States, and supplemental trials are in progress.

#### *Direct Cardiac or Aortic Compression Devices*

These devices are intended for short-term use (<7 days) for any cause of cardiogenic shock.

# **Section III Ischemic Cardiomyopathy**

See Chapter 10.

# **Section IV Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy**

See Chapter 19.

# **Section V Restrictive Cardiomyopathy**

## DEFINITION

Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a cardiac muscle disease that results in impaired ventricular diastolic function with loss of compliance and is usually accompanied by diffuse ventricular hypertrophy. The most common example of restrictive cardiomyopathy is endomyocardial fibrosis (or obliterative cardiomyopathy), a form of restrictive cardiomyopathy in which the pathologic process—chronic inflammation—is restricted to the endocardium.

# HISTORICAL NOTE

This condition has been known to exist for many years, but its in vivo differentiation from chronic constrictive pericarditis became possible only when modern cardiac diagnostic methods became available. Endomyocardial fibrosis began to receive serious study during the late 1940s. D'Arbela, Brockington, and Davies and their colleagues identified the similarity between the tropical zone form of the disease (Davies endocardial fibrosis)C11 and that of the temperate zone (Löffler endocarditis) during the 1960s and 1970s.B3,B13,D2,D3,D5,L5 Its surgical treatment was first reported by Prigent and Dubost and their colleagues in 1973.D8,P8

# MORPHOLOGY

The ventricular walls are excessively rigid, resulting in restrictive filling and reduced left, right, or biventricular diastolic volume with normal or near-normal systolic function. Microscopically, fibrosis and myocyte hypertrophy are usually present. Often there is no morphologic suggestion as to etiology. However, restrictive cardiomyopathy may be secondary to amyloid infiltration and other processes, with or without eosinophilia.

Endomyocardial fibroelastosis consists of fibrous endocardial lesions involving primarily the inflow portions of right and left ventricles, along with the posterior wall and apex.C11,D4 The atrioventricular valves are often involved and regurgitant. The outflow tract of the ventricle is usually spared.C6 The heart may be more or less normal in size or somewhat enlarged, but massive cardiomegaly is rare, as is ventricular hypertrophy.C6,S8 Although both ventricles are commonly involved, 40% of patients have purely LV involvement, and 10% purely RV involvement.C6,S8 Metras and colleagues have described a more localized form of the disease that affects only the LV papillary muscles and presents as isolated mitral regurgitation.M14

Microscopically, a thick layer of hyalinized fibrous tissue is usually seen in the endocardium.D3 Calcification may be present, and thrombi may cover the inner portion of the involved ventricle. The myocardium is minimally affected. These changes may be associated with eosinophilia (Löffler syndrome).B13 In addition to evidence of chronic inflammation, an anomalous lymphatic pattern has been observed, connected to the distal coronary circulation.

Endomyocardial fibrosis is of unknown etiology. There has been speculation as to the possible role of a diet high in bananas, malnutrition, and immunologic responses from various infections.B17 About 50% of patients undergoing resection reveal molecular evidence of a number of infectiveagent genomes of unknown importance to pathogenesis.I1 In a subset of patients, antimyosin antibodies against specific myocardial proteins have been identified, and immunosuppressive therapy in such patients has been suggested.M18 These antibodies against C-terminal sequences may mediate the disease in a similar fashion as Chagas disease.W1

# CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

The primary physiologic abnormality in restrictive cardiomyopathy is severe impairment of ventricular compliance. Generally, ventricular systolic function is unimpaired. Pathophysiologically, this condition simulates chronic constrictive pericarditis to such an extent that the two conditions are separated hemodynamically with great difficulty.

Endomyocardial fibrosis is pathophysiologically complex. Early in this process, there are only scattered areas of fibrosis, with little hemodynamic effect. As progressively increasing endomyocardial fibrosis develops, with consequent restriction of ventricular filling, ventricular end-diastolic pressures elevate, as do pulmonary or systemic venous pressures, depending on which ventricle is involved. Involvement of the atrioventricular valves then adds valvar regurgitation to the already impaired hemodynamic state.V4

When endomyocardial fibrosis involves both ventricles, RV failure usually dominates the clinical picture, with liver enlargement, ascites, and peripheral edema in association with tricuspid regurgitation. There are often pleural and pericardial effusions. RV endomyocardial fibrosis is characterized by distinctive findings of right atrial enlargement, as well as hepatomegaly, ascites, and peripheral edema. With isolated LV involvement, there are features of LV failure and often mitral regurgitation.M16 There is usually a third heart sound.

*Chest radiography* shows cardiomegaly, usually attributable to right atrial enlargement and pericardial effusion.M4,M5 Calcification may be seen diffusely within the ventricles.C8 *Echocardiography* reveals enlarged atria, ventricular cavity obliteration, and at times, mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.H2 Mitral and tricuspid valve Doppler inflow velocities reveal a restrictive pattern with short deceleration time.B7 *Magnetic resonance imaging* is particularly valuable in detecting delayed endocardial enhancement.P5,S7,S9,S11,V5 Cardiac catheterization confirms the diagnosis, with physiologic findings of cardiac restriction (see Section I of Chapter 23) dominating the findings. Angiography often reveals obliteration of the apex of the involved ventricle, which in the RV may mimic Ebstein anomaly.V1 The LV may show an apical diverticulum.

#### NATURAL HISTORY

Generally, symptoms are of long duration, with death delayed for 5 to 20 years after abnormalities of cardiac function become apparent. However, the natural history of patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy has not been well defined.

Endomyocardial fibrosis tends to affect childrenD6 and young adults. It occurs primarily in Uganda, Nigeria, and India.V4 However, cases have been sporadically reported in many countries, including the United States.L2 The natural history of patients with this type of cardiomyopathy is generally unfavorable, characterized by a slowly deteriorating course and death within 5 to 10 years, often within 1 to 2 years.C6,D5,P3

# TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

Resection of endocardial fibrosis is performed using CPB and cold cardioplegic myocardial protection (see "Preparation for Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2 and "Methods of Myocardial Management during Cardiac Surgery" in Chapter 3). In left-sided disease, the mitral valve and interior of the LV are exposed through the usual incision for valve repair or replacement in the right side of the left atrium (see "Technique of Operation" in Section I of Chapter 11). When exposure is unsatisfactory, an approach through the right atrium and across the atrial septum is used; only if no other approach is possible is a left ventriculotomy used.L2 The thickened and fibrotic endocardium in the inlet and apical portions of the LV are excised. Endocardiectomy is as extensive as needed, but no attempt is made to remove the fibrotic plaque in one block. Localizing the pathology to the inlet and apical portions in the ventricles facilitates the surgical procedure. Often the tensor apparatus of the mitral valve must be sacrificed as part of the excision, and the valve is often regurgitant preoperatively. Therefore, in most patients, mitral valve replacement is part of the procedure (see "Mitral Valve Replacement" under Technique of Operation in Section I of Chapter 11).

Approach is through the right atrium in cases of isolated RV involvement. The procedure described is carried out, often associated with tricuspid valve replacement. However, whenever possible, a 5-mm strip of endocardium is left on the ventricular septum along the anulus of the tricuspid valve, particularly in the region of the anteroseptal commissure, to avoid damage to the bundle of His.M13

# RESULTS

In general, risk of death after operation has been 10% to 20%, and greater in patients with biventricular disease. Metras and colleagues have reported 4 hospital deaths (20%; CL 10%- 33%) among 20 patients operated on in Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast).M15

Functional results of operation are good.D7,H7,M19,M20,V2 In most patients, the hemodynamic state of the LV returns to normal after surgical treatment of the left-sided form of the disease. However, in RV endomyocardial fibrosis, despite clinical improvement, the hemodynamic status of the ventricle usually remains abnormal.M19 RV endocardiectomy may be complicated by complete heart block, but Metras and colleagues have avoided this in most cases by being conservative with the endocardial resection beneath the tricuspid valve.M14

# INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Operation is indicated for patients whose disability has progressed to NYHA class III or IV.

These specific cardiomyopathies (Box 20-2) can be classified according to usual categories, but their association with specific cardiac systemic disorders warrants special mention. Treatment of cardiomyopathy associated with specific cardiac or systemic disease not only requires treatment of the cardiomyocyte disease, but is also directed at the cardiac or systemic diseases that are the root causes of the cardiomyopathy. Effectiveness in treating the specific disease usually determines prognosis. The stage at onset of cardiomyopathy and rate of progression of the primary disease are also prominent factors in the outcome of therapy. Peripartum cardiomyopathy is associated with a mortality of 28%, with most deaths occurring within 3 months of onset of symptoms.S10 Nevertheless, there is clinical improvement in about 50% of patients on standard medical therapy. Improvement is correlated with higher baseline ventricular function measured by LVEF.
