#### DEFINITION

*Cardiac trauma* is damage done to the heart by penetrating or nonpenetrating injuries.

# **Section I Penetrating Cardiac Trauma**

#### HISTORICAL NOTE

The first suggestion that wounds of the heart and great vessels could be sutured may have been by Roberts in 1881.R2 In 1882 and 1895, studies of experimental closure of cardiac wounds in animals were reported.B3,D1 On September 9, 1896, Rehn in Germany successfully repaired a penetrating cardiac wound.R1 Mead reported that Williams first successfully performed a heart operation in the United States when, in 1889 at Provident Hospital in Chicago, he repaired a stab wound.M3 The first published report of a successful heart operation in the United States was by Hill, who repaired a stab wound in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1902.H4 In his report, Hill not only described successfully suturing the wound, but also summarized 37 other cases reported by that time.

#### MORPHOLOGY

When a sharp, long-bladed instrument is violently driven into the midportion of the thorax and penetrates the pericardium, a laceration of the heart or great vessels commonly results. The right ventricle alone is involved in 35% of patients reaching a hospital after their traumatic episode.D2 The left ventricle alone is involved in about 25% of cases, and infrequently, the right atrium alone is involved. In nearly 30% of patients, more than one cardiac chamber is injured.S15 In addition, coronary arteries can be transected and traumatic coronary arteriovenous fistulae produced, cardiac valves can be lacerated, and great vessels can be penetrated.A3,L3

When a missile penetrates the thorax and pericardium, a cardiac wound is frequently produced. Many high-velocity missiles produce massive through-and-through injuries of the heart. Occasionally, however, a missile may produce a tangential laceration of a ventricle or penetrate a cardiac chamber and come to rest within it.

# CLINICAL FEATURES, DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA, AND NATURAL HISTORY

#### Pathophysiology

Most stab wounds of the heart result in acute pericardial tamponade, although occasionally, rapidly exsanguinating hemorrhage may result. The patient thus usually presents with symptoms and signs of acute cardiac tamponade complicated by acute blood loss. (For a discussion of cardiac tamponade, see "Acute Cardiac Tamponade" under Clinical Features and Diagnostic Criteria in Section I of Chapter 23.)

Missile wounds usually result in acute hemorrhagic shock, which may be rapidly fatal. If not, the patient enters the hospital profoundly hypotensive, with tachycardia and collapsed veins.

Penetrating cardiac wounds are frequently accompanied by wounds involving the pleural space, the intrapericardial thoracic vessels, the lung, and occasionally by wounds of the liver and other abdominal viscera.

# Symptoms and Signs

External evidence of a penetrating wound is usually apparent, although in the case of injury with a stiletto, the external wound may initially escape discovery. The external wound and evidence for either hemorrhagic shock or acute pericardial tamponade dominate the clinical presentation.

# Special Studies

If the patient's condition permits, a chest radiograph is made. In the rare situation of an initially stable patient, or in a patient recovering from repair of a penetrating wound in another organ and now suspected of having also suffered a cardiac laceration, usual techniques of cardiac investigation are used. Two-dimensional echocardiography, particularly transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), is the technique best adapted to these situations. Its use minimizes, in nonemergency situations, subxiphoid exploratory pericardiotomy.B5,M2,M4

# TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

When a patient presents with a penetrating wound of the chest in a location and direction that could involve the heart, the assumption is made that a penetrating wound of the heart exists. Resuscitative measures, including endotracheal intubation, volume replacement, and insertion of chest tubes, are performed promptly on admission to the emergency department, except in stable patients without shock or respiratory distress.

All centers properly prepared for treating patients with cardiac wounds have well-developed protocols.S6 Only general methods of management are described here.

# Stab Wounds

Patients with stab wounds of the heart and great vessels usually survive when treatment is adequate, except for those in extremis on admission (most of whom have suffered immediate massive hemorrhage from laceration of a great vessel).

If the stabbing device is still in place when the patient is admitted to the emergency department, it is not removed until the incision is made and ideally not until the pericardium is opened.

When the patient arrives in the emergency department unconscious and without vital signs or semiconscious with gasping respirations, a thready pulse, and no blood pressure, and all evidence points to a cardiac or great vessel wound as the cause, prognosis is poor; immediate thoracotomy (see discussion under "Missile Wounds" later in this chapter) is indicated if the emergency department is prepared for this type of major surgery.A5,I1,S6 If not, a large-bore needle (13F) is inserted into the pericardial space through the subxiphoid route, and the patient is transported rapidly to an operating room. Because of the pathophysiology of acute cardiac tamponade (see Chapter 23), removal of even 40 to 50 mL of blood usually improves the hemodynamic state, at least temporarily. When the patient is in shock but has vital signs, a pericardiocentesis is performed as described, followed by rapid transfer to the operating room. When the patient's condition is stable and a cardiac stab wound is only suspected, investigation can be accomplished in the emergency department or in the operating room if a noncardiac procedure is indicated. This evaluation is best performed by TEE.

Once in the operating room, the patient is rapidly anesthetized, prepared, and draped for operation. A large-bore needle is placed in an easily accessible large vein as these preparations are being made. Surgical draping should be wide, with the chest and abdomen fully exposed. Median sternotomy is made and the pericardium opened. (In institutions in which cardiac surgery is not frequently performed, an anterolateral incision, usually left-sided, is made, because this incision can be made rapidly and is the most generally useful.)

Blood is rapidly aspirated from the pericardial space with high-vacuum suckers. Ventricular wounds are best controlled initially by digital compression. Atrial and caval wounds are generally not well controlled in this manner, and wide Allis (Allis-Adair) clamps serve ideally to establish hemostasis by apposing the wound edges. If this is not possible or if the wound edges tear after application of clamps, a Foley catheter with a large balloon volume can be inserted into the cardiac chamber or vein and inflated. Only after digital or instrumental control of active bleeding has been accomplished should attention be turned to suturing the wounds. At this time, physiologic resuscitation should be completed. Blood volume is reconstituted with donor-specific matched or unmatched type O-negative blood to augment previously infused crystalloid or colloid, and blood pH is restored toward normal with bicarbonate. Supplemental calcium is usually given.

Ventricular wounds are best sutured with interrupted pledgeted mattress sutures of No. 2-0 or 3-0 polyester or polypropylene. A great danger in myocardial lacerations is their enlargement by the act of passing sutures in a fully filled and beating ventricle. It is often appropriate to induce inflow occlusion to empty the heart and provide a quieter field. After an interval of hyperventilation, the vena cavae are occluded using vascular clamps, followed by clamp occlusion of the ascending aorta after the heart has emptied a few beats later. The cardiac wound is sutured over the next 2 to 3 minutes; thereafter, the caval and aortic clamps are released. The heart will have continued to beat slowly during the occlusion period. Occasionally, a ventricular laceration is so extensive that it requires cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and patchgrafting of the ventricular free wall. Wounds near a major coronary artery are similarly sutured, with pledgets on both sides of the artery and the sutures passing beneath it. If the left anterior descending coronary artery has been damaged, a coronary artery bypass graft should be placed (see Chapter 7). Atrial or caval wounds are closed by continuous No. 4-0 or 5-0 polypropylene sutures. Suturing is done beneath the clamp or carefully over the top of the inflated balloon of a Foley catheter, and the clamp is removed (or balloon deflated) only after the suture line is largely in place.

Unless there is near certainty that the pleural spaces have not been violated, both are opened widely through the median sternotomy. The internal thoracic arteries, a potential source of hemorrhage, are examined and, if damaged, are suture-ligated. Damaged areas of lung are oversewn or stapled. The hilum of each lung is examined for injury to the pulmonary vessels.

Drainage catheters are placed in each pleural space (see "Positioning Chest Tubes" under Completing Cardiopulmonary Bypass in Section III of Chapter 2), and one may be placed in the pericardial space as well. If hemostasis within the pericardium has been satisfactory, the pericardium is loosely closed with widely spaced interrupted sutures. The sternotomy is closed in the usual manner (see Section III of Chapter 2).

## Missile Wounds

Patients with missile wounds of the heart are far less likely to survive than those with stab wounds.A5,I1,M2,S6 Patients who are unconscious or without vital signs, or who are semiconscious but without a measurable blood pressure, should receive immediate thoracotomy if the emergency room is properly prepared.T1 A left anterolateral incision is made, curving beneath the breast, and the thorax is entered through the fifth or sixth interspace. An assistant spreads the wound with two handheld retractors, or a self-retaining thoracotomy retractor is inserted, and digital control of the hemorrhage is obtained. If trained surgeons are in attendance and the repair appears to be a simple one, repair is then performed. Otherwise, the patient is transferred to a prepared operating room while digital control of the hemorrhage is maintained. If digital control of the hemorrhage is not possible, survival is unlikely and any further intervention inadvisable.

Patients not meeting these criteria for operation in the emergency department are transported immediately to the operating room. Principles of management are the same as described for penetrating wounds, but the result is less often successful.

# SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

If a central venous catheter was not inserted in the operating room, it is placed postoperatively. Principles of care are the same as those used for patients after other forms of cardiac surgery (see Chapter 5).

A special consideration is the possibility that a major coronary artery has been damaged by the trauma or at operation. Thus, during the first few postoperative hours, if the hemodynamic state is unexpectedly unsatisfactory despite appropriate ventricular filling pressures—and particularly if the electrocardiogram suggests coronary injury—emergency coronary arteriography is performed. If a major vessel is interrupted or importantly narrowed, emergency coronary artery bypass grafting is performed.

During the early postoperative period, it must be kept in mind that penetrating wounds may have perforated a cardiac septum or damaged an atrioventricular or, rarely, a semilunar valve.S14 Should any evidence suggest such an injury, appropriate studies are indicated. TEE is particularly informative. If the findings are positive, in unstable patients, immediate repair should be considered. If the hemodynamic state remains satisfactory, however, delay for 8 to 12 weeks permits a more secure repair.

# RESULTS

Prompt and effective therapy allows good results in most patients with stab wounds of the heart.A5,I1,S11 Overall, about 80% of patients survive. Results for missile wounds are less satisfactory and depend upon extensiveness of the wound, condition of the patient on admission, and associated injuries.A5,B2,I1 Overall survival is about 40%. The functional result in surviving patients is usually excellent, even when patch-grafting of the left ventricular free wall has been necessary.S16

# INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Presence of a penetrating wound to the heart is an indication for immediate operation.E1 A stab wound over the heart without bleeding or hypotension may indicate that no penetration has occurred, and is therefore not an indication per se for operation. TEE is helpful in this situation.

Occasionally, patients convalesce apparently satisfactorily and without special treatment (usually a stab wound rather than injury by a missile), only to come to medical attention weeks to years later because of a murmur or heart failure. Special studies usually demonstrate a ventricular septal defect (VSD), laceration of a cardiac valve, or aorta-to–pulmonary artery or aorta-to–brachiocephalic vein fistula.A3 Operation is indicated, and a good result can usually be obtained.

# **Section II Nonpenetrating Cardiac Trauma**

#### HISTORICAL NOTE

In earlier times, cardiac rupture was the only sequela of nonpenetrating (closed or blunt) cardiac trauma to receive attention. Apparently, this catastrophic event was originally observed by Senac in 1778.S8 Although rupture of the ventricular septum was described in 1847 by Hewett, not until 1959 did Campbell and colleagues at the University of Minnesota first successfully repair a VSD produced by nonpenetrating trauma.C1,H3 More recently, surgical attention has focused on rupture of cardiac valves as a consequence of nonpenetrating cardiac injuries, although in 1927 Adam described such injuries as well as the natural history of patients with valvar rupture secondary to trauma.A1 Cardiac contusion has more recently been recognized as one of the complications of nonpenetrating cardiac trauma.J2

When the heart is compressed between two objects, such as the sternum and the vertebral column, intracardiac—and particularly intraventricular—pressure suddenly becomes elevated, and the free atrial or ventricular walls, ventricular septum, tensor apparatus of the atrioventricular valves, or aortic valve cusps may rupture. The same holds true when there is sudden deceleration of the chest with the heart thrust forward against the sternum. Rarely, a coronary artery fistula to a cardiac chamber develops after nonpenetrating chest trauma.

Less violent nonpenetrating injury may result simply in contusion of the myocardium. Such contusions may vary from small areas of subepicardial or subendocardial petechiae to full-thickness injury of the cardiac wall. Radionuclide angiography has shown that the anteriorly situated right ventricle is particularly susceptible to contusion.S13

*Commotio cordis* is a syndrome of sudden death seen infrequently after low-energy trauma to the anterior chest wall. Experimentally, Link and colleagues found this to occur within a narrow window during the repolarization phase of the cardiac cycle, 30 to 15 ms before the peak of the T wave.L2 Clinically, this has been reported in children struck in the chest with a baseball.M1

# CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

# Cardiac Contusion

Patients with cardiac contusion may exhibit no symptoms, precordial pain, or symptoms indistinguishable from those of angina. Dysrhythmias of different types may develop.

Electrocardiographic abnormalities may be present shortly after injury or can be delayed 12 to 24 hours. Abnormalities may be transient or longer lasting, depending on extent of myocardial damage.A2,J2 Q waves may develop similar to those seen in acute myocardial infarction. Myocardial enzymes may become elevated after injury and, if so, provide a near-positive diagnosis of cardiac contusion.K2 However, the electrocardiographic and enzymatic criteria are relatively insensitive and nonspecific indicators of cardiac contusion.P3

A more sensitive indicator is radionuclide angiography. Demonstration of decreased right or left ventricular ejection fraction in a previously healthy person and abnormalities of left ventricular segmental wall motion suggest myocardial contusion.H2 This diagnostic study also permits sequential examination and indicates that considerable myocardial dysfunction can fail to impair the hemodynamic state; in other cases, if myocardial dysfunction does impair the hemodynamic state, it can revert to normal within a few weeks.S12

#### Cardiac Rupture

When rupture of the heart occurs, the most common site is the right atrium. In most cases, immediate and severe acute cardiac tamponade develops. An exception is when there has been concomitant rupture of the pericardium, and then there is exsanguinating hemorrhage. Cardiac rupture may occur immediately upon injury or several days later; in the interim, there may be no suggestion of impending catastrophe. Rupture occasionally may be localized, involving primarily a branch of a coronary artery.B4

#### Ventricular Septal Rupture

When the ventricular septum ruptures, it usually occurs at the time of injury. The characteristic murmur of a VSD appears. When the rupture is small, the hemodynamic state remains good. When it is large, the patient exhibits signs and symptoms of pulmonary venous hypertension, and cardiac output is likely to be low.

#### Atrioventricular Valve Rupture

When rupture of the tensor apparatus or leaflet of an atrioventricular valve is a complication of closed trauma, its occurrence is usually immediate. Most commonly, the tricuspid valve is ruptured, and this may be accompanied by rupture of a branch of the right coronary artery into the right ventricle.S1 Thus, initial clinical manifestations are minimal, and the diagnosis is not suggested until a number of weeks have passed, by which time the characteristic signs and symptoms are presentS9 (see "Tricuspid Regurgitation" under Clinical Features and Diagnostic Criteria in Chapter 14).

Less frequently, the tensor apparatus of the mitral valve is ruptured.H1 Patients usually exhibit sudden pulmonary venous hypertension and rapidly developing symptoms including frank pulmonary edema.J1 Occasionally, mitral regurgitation may slowly worsen, and operation is required several weeks to several months after injury.C2,P1

#### Aortic Cusp Rupture

Rarely, an aortic valve cusp is ruptured by nonpenetrating cardiac trauma. Acute pulmonary edema can be precipitated by rupture of two cusps, but symptoms may become evident only after an apparently symptom-free interval.S4

#### NATURAL HISTORY

## Cardiac Contusion

Only fragmentary information is available concerning the natural history of patients with myocardial contusion, because this condition often goes undiagnosed. The natural history is probably similar to that of acute myocardial infarction. When the area involved is small, premature death is uncommon. When it is of moderate size, and particularly when there is associated damage to the left anterior descending coronary artery, a typical large left ventricular aneurysm may develop.S10 The natural history then is that of other large left ventricular aneurysms (see Chapter 8). When the area involved is extensive, death may occur relatively early after injury in the same modes as after acute myocardial infarction. Pericarditis and hemopericardium may develop as complications of cardiac contusion.K1,S2,S5 The natural history then becomes that of these conditions (see Chapter 23), with possible late development of cardiac tamponade and chronic constrictive pericarditis.

#### Cardiac Rupture

Cardiac rupture is generally rapidly fatal without operation. However, if the rupture is small, and particularly if it involves the right atrium or right ventricle and the pericardium is intact, the hemopericardium that develops may tamponade the bleeding, and the hemodynamic state may remain reasonably good. Some patients survive such an episode, as evidenced by the very old finding of Cabriolanus (in 1604) of healed cardiac wounds in persons who had been thought to be well.B1

# Ventricular Septal Rupture

As in congenital VSDs, the natural history of ventricular septal rupture depends on the size of the defect (see Chapter 35). When it is small, the early posttraumatic hemodynamic state is good, as is the long-term outlook. When it is large, the hemodynamic state may not be good early after the injury, and chronic heart failure may ensue.

# Atrioventricular Valve Rupture

In the same way that excision of the tricuspid valve is well tolerated (see Chapter 14), so is acute traumatic rupture of the tricuspid valve. Often the diagnosis is not made at the time of injury. Usually, within 2 to 3 months the patient exhibits decreased exercise tolerance, and signs of tricuspid valve regurgitation become evident.T2

In mitral valve rupture, as in spontaneous rupture of chordae tendineae or postinfarction mitral regurgitation, the patient often becomes acutely ill within a few hours of injury.S7 Perhaps because traumatic mitral valve rupture is associated with a variable amount of cardiac contusion and myocardial dysfunction, this condition often results in deterioration and death within 24 hours.M5

# Aortic Cusp Rupture

Natural history of acute aortic cusp rupture may be similar to that of acute aortic regurgitation occurring with infective endocarditis and cusp perforation (see Chapters 12 and 15), although there may be a symptom-free interval.S4

## TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

When diagnosis is rupture of a cardiac free wall, immediate operation is undertaken, but preparations must be made for CPB. If the patient's condition permits, the femoral artery is exposed and cannulated (after heparinization) before median sternotomy. After median sternotomy, it may be seen that the rupture involves only a small area. In that case, digital control and placement of pledgeted mattress sutures suffice.L1 If digital control cannot be obtained, CPB is established; blood is aspirated from the pericardium for venous return, and a reduced systemic blood flow rate is used. As soon as a single venous cannula can be inserted into the right atrium, CPB is converted to usual techniques and flow rates. Repair of the free wall rupture is improvised but, in the case of the ventricle, is generally similar to repair of a myocardial rupture complicating acute myocardial infarctionG1,W1 (see Chapter 8).

Posttraumatic VSDs and traumatic injuries of the tricuspid valve are managed in a manner similar to that for congenital and postinfarction VSDs and other types of tricuspid valve regurgitationA4 (see Chapters 9, 14, and 35). In tricuspid valve rupture the tensor apparatus is usually involved. An attempt should be made to reconstruct the leaflets using pericardium, and the tensor apparatus using artificial chordae of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) suture.N1 For trauma to the mitral valve, repair, if possible, is advised (see "Repair of Mitral Regurgitation" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 11). Occasionally, mitral valve replacement is necessary.P2 In the rare case of rupture of a single aortic valve cusp, repair is possibleD3; when two cusps are involved, valve replacement is usually necessary.S4

# SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Care usually given to patients after cardiac surgery is used (see Chapter 5).

#### RESULTS

Except in massive traumatic cardiac ruptures, results of repair in young and otherwise healthy persons are good. Aggressive therapy can salvage a number of patients if carried out in an institution in which cardiac surgery is frequently performed.

# INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

## Cardiac Contusion

There is no indication for surgical treatment of patients with cardiac contusions. Close follow-up is indicated, however, in case delayed ventricular arrhythmia, cardiac rupture, or constrictive pericarditis develops.A2,S3

#### Cardiac Rupture

When a patient survives the acute rupture long enough to reach a hospital, immediate operation is indicated.

#### Ventricular Septal Rupture

Unless the patient is asymptomatic and the ventricular septal rupture small, surgical closure is indicated. However, the possibility of preoperative improvement by use of percutaneous techniques should be considered (see "Percutaneous Closure of Defect" under Special Situations and Controversies in Chapter 9). If the hemodynamic state remains good during the early posttraumatic period, repair is deferred to 8 to 12 weeks after injury so that a more secure closure can be made.

#### Atrioventricular and Aortic Valve Rupture

Because important valvar regurgitation usually develops after atrioventricular or aortic valve rupture, operation is advisable. When the tricuspid valve has ruptured, operation is rarely urgently necessary and is often best delayed 8 to 12 weeks after the injury. In mitral or aortic valve rupture, operative repair is often urgently indicated.
