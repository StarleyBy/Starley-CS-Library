## DEFINITION

Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is abnormal persistence of a patent lumen in the fetal ductus arteriosus, which usually connects the upper descending thoracic aorta with the proximal portion of the left pulmonary artery (LPA). When the aortic arch is right-sided, the ductus usually connects to the proximal right pulmonary artery. The ductus may at times connect to the adjacent subclavian or brachiocephalic artery rather than to the upper descending thoracic aorta.

This chapter is primarily concerned with isolated PDA. PDA associated with other anomalies is discussed briefly here and in more detail in other chapters (Coarctation of the Aorta and Interrupted Aortic Arch, Chapter 48; Ventricular Septal Defect, Chapter 35; and Ventricular Septal Defect with Pulmonary Stenosis or Atresia, Chapter 38).

## HISTORICAL NOTE

The ductus arteriosus apparently was first described by Galen (born AD 129). It was rediscovered by Botallo in the 16th century, although some attribute the description of its postnatal closure to AciernoA3,F6 and Harvey.F5,H3 In 1888, Munro demonstrated in an infant cadaver the feasibility of dissecting and ligating a PDA.M12 In 1900, Gibson described the characteristic continuous murmur of this anomaly.G1 However, it was not until 1937 that Strieder in Boston attempted to close a PDA surgically in a patient with fulminating infective endarteritis; the patient died on the fourth postoperative day with gastric distention and aspiration of vomitus.G8

Cardiac surgery received a great impetus on August 26, 1938, when Gross successfully ligated the PDA of a 7-yearold girl at Boston Children's Hospital.G13 Subsequently, he developed division rather than ligation as the surgical technique of choice.G11,G12 The first successful repair of an infected PDA was reported in 1940 by Touroff and Vesell, who later reported successful division of an infected PDA.T3,T4 Portsmann and colleagues reported catheter closure of this anomaly in 1971.P6 The first successful catheter closure of a PDA in a neonate or infant was performed by Rashkind and Cuaso in 1977.R2,R3 Thus, PDA is the anomaly that initiated not only the *surgical* treatment of congenital heart disease, but also its *transcatheter* treatment.

## MORPHOLOGY AND MORPHOGENESIS

## Morphology of Normal Ductal Closure

At birth, the fetal ductus arteriosus is patent, resembling, according to Gittenberger-de Groot and colleaguesG3:

*…a muscular artery with an intact, wavy internal elastic lamina, interrupted only underneath the intimal cushions. At those sites the elastic lamina is fragmented and is sometimes split up into several layers. The media is composed mainly of circularly arranged smooth muscle cells, with only minimal elastin fibers in between. The medial components may be widely separated, predominantly along the line of junction with intimal cushions, thereby creating large pools filled with a mucoid, slightly eosinophilic substance, the so-called mucoid lakes. In more advanced stages of anatomic closure, necrosis of cellular components of the media and a diffuse fibrous proliferation of the intima begin to appear.*

Postnatal closure occurs in two stages.C4 The first stage is complete within 10 to 15 hours after birth in full-term infants; smooth muscle in the media of the ductal wall contracts, producing shortening and an increase in wall thickness. This functional closure is assisted by approximation of the intimal cushions. The *intimal cushions* (or mounds or pillows) are swellings composed of longitudinally oriented smooth muscle cells that protrude into the lumen and lie between the endothelium and internal elastic lamina and thus within the intima.J2 They thicken as the duct matures and are most prominent at the pulmonary end. Muscle contraction occurs both circumferentially from the circularly arranged smooth muscle cells that fill almost the entire media, and longitudinally from one or more bands of muscle in the inner media.S5

The second stage of closure is usually completed by 2 to 3 weeks. It is the result of diffuse fibrous proliferation of the intima, sometimes associated with necrosis of the inner layer of the media, and hemorrhage into the wall. The latter may be due to intimal tears producing a limited dissection of the ductus wall; there may also be small thrombi within the lumen, but gross luminal thrombus is rare.C1 These changes result in permanent sealing of the lumen and produce the fibrous *ligamentum arteriosum.*

Closure usually begins at the pulmonary end and may remain incomplete at the aortic end, leaving an aortic ampulla from which the ligamentum arteriosum arises. Less commonly, there may be a ductus diverticulum arising from the proximal LPA.

The ductus arteriosus is completely closed by 8 weeks of age in 88% of infants with a normal cardiovascular system.C6

When the process is delayed, the term *prolonged patency* of the ductus arteriosus is appropriate; when the process ultimately fails, *persistent patency* of the ductus arteriosus is the appropriate term. Ductus closure or patency is mediated by release of vasoactive substances (acetylcholine, bradykinin, endogenous catecholamines, and probably others), by variations in pH, but chiefly by oxygen tensionM9 and prostaglandins (PGE1, PGE2, and prostacyclin PGI2).C9 Oxygen tension and prostaglandins act in opposite directions, with an increasing PO2 constricting the ductus and prostaglandins relaxing it; the potency of each varies at different gestational ages.H8 Thus, the ductus is considerably more sensitive to PO2 in the mature fetus and to prostaglandins (specifically, PGE1) in the immature fetus. The complex interplay of these factors is the reason prolonged patency of the ductus is more common in premature than term infants, particularly when there is associated respiratory distress syndrome (see Special Situations and Controversies later in this chapter). *Intermittent patency* of the ductus arteriosus has been documented, particularly when the ductus is long and narrow.D5

#### Position and Absence

At birth, usually in subjects with other cardiac anomalies, the ductus may be unilateral, bilateral, or (rarely) completely absent. It is absent in 35% of autopsy specimens with tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis, in 40% of those with tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia, in almost all patients with tetralogy of Fallot and absent pulmonary valve (see Chapter 38), and in truncus arteriosus (see Chapter 43). It is rarely absent in patients with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum (4%) (see Chapter 40) or in those with pulmonary atresia and other complex anomalies (15%).

#### Anatomic Details

# *Isolated Patent Ductus Arteriosus*

The usual isolated PDA connects to the upper descending thoracic aorta 2 to 10 mm beyond the aortic origin of the left subclavian artery (Fig. 37-1).C1 From the aorta, it passes centrally toward the origin of the LPA from the pulmonary trunk, either directly or angling superiorly and hugging the undersurface of the distal aortic arch. When, as in the normally developing heart, the ductus delivers approximately 55% of the combined ventricular output into the descending aorta, the ductus meets the aorta at a proximal acute angle (<40 degrees) and a distal obtuse angle (110 to 160 degrees, mean 134 degrees)C1,H7,M3 (Table 37-1; see also Fig. 37-1).

The PDA is generally 5 to 10 mm in length (in autopsy specimens, 2.5-8 mm), with a wide aortic orifice (4-12 mm) and a considerably narrower pulmonary orifice, and it is restrictive to flow. The PDA may be longer or shorter than this and may have a wide pulmonary as well as aortic orifice.

#### *Patent Ductus Arteriosus as a Coexisting Anomaly*

When other cardiac anomalies are present, orientation of the ductus to the aortic arch varies, as does the flow pattern in fetal life.C1 When there is pulmonary atresia and the pulmonary circulation is ductus dependent, with ductal flow in utero occurring from the aorta to the pulmonary artery, the ductus becomes a downwardly directed branch of the distal aortic arch. The proximal angle is much less acute and often

obtuse, and the distal angle is often acuteC1,R10 (Fig. 37-2; see also Table 37-1) (see "Aortic Arch and Ductus Arteriosus" under Morphology in Section I of Chapter 38). When this is not the case, pulmonary atresia likely developed late in pregnancy.S1 The ductus is also usually narrower and longer (see Fig. 37-2).C1 The lumen is usually narrower at the pulmonary end and wider at the aortic end, as in isolated PDA.

In aortic atresia and coarctation of the aorta, the distal angle is normal, but the proximal angle in these shorter, broader examples of PDA is much less acute, probably because ductal flow enters both the ascending and descending aorta.C1

Uncommonly, in the presence of a left aortic arch, the ductus may arise from an aortic diverticulum (thought to represent persistence of the most distal portion of the right fourth branchial arch) that projects from the medial aspect of the left arch just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery.G9 In rare cases in which the ductus is bilateral, the right-sided PDA connects the right pulmonary artery to the brachiocephalic artery.

In the presence of a right aortic arch, a left-sided ductus is still more common than a right-sided ductus. When there is mirror-image branching of the right arch, the left PDA arises from the distal brachiocephalic (or proximal left

subclavian) artery (see Chapter 38). Much less commonly, the right PDA persists in mirror image to the normal, passing from the right arch beyond the right subclavian artery to the right pulmonary artery origin. A PDA (or ligamentum arteriosum) arising from an aortic diverticulum or from an aberrant left subclavian artery is one form of vascular ring (see Chapter 51).

## Histology

Histology of a persistent PDA is different from that of simple prolonged patency of the ductus.G2 It is also different from that of the adjoining great arteries. A persistent PDA has a relatively thick intima with an unfragmented elastic lamina separating it from the media, an additional and pronounced wavy unfragmented subendothelial elastic lamina, and variable mucoid material in the media where there is an intricate helicoid spiral muscular arrangement.G2 The media contains variable amounts of elastic material that may form conspicuous lamellae, making the ductus wall resemble the wall of the aorta (aortification).

# Aneurysms of Ductus Arteriosus

Aneurysms of the ductus arteriosus, which are rare lesions, appear to be of two types. One is the spontaneous infantile ductal aneurysm, which is present at birth or develops shortly thereafter.H6 The other develops in childhood or adult life.

Presence of the first type may not be detected until autopsy after death from other causes.D1 The aneurysm involves the entire length of the ductus arteriosus and is usually associated with occlusion of the pulmonary artery end and a relatively narrow but patent aortic end.F8 It generally contains thrombus and is occasionally a site of infection and embolism. Rarely, it may be a true dissecting aneurysm of the ductal wall.F1 This rare lesion manifests most often in newborns with a history of respiratory difficulties.D6,H6 It produces a tumorlike shadow of variable size that projects beyond the mediastinum adjacent to the aortic knob in the posteroanterior chest radiograph. The aneurysm usually regresses spontaneously within weeks or months, presumably as a result of complete thrombosis and organization, but progressive enlargement or onset of hoarseness from recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement is an indication for surgical exploration and excision.H6 Less marked dilatation of the ductus can be seen on the plain chest radiograph as a fusiform shadow between 6 and 18 hours after birth, disappearing by 24 to 48 hours of age.B1 It has been called the *ductus bump.*

The second type of ductal aneurysm is thought to be unrelated to the infantile form. The ductus may be patent at both ends, but usually the pulmonary artery end is closed.G5,T9 There is a tendency for progressive enlargement, and death may occur from rupture.C13

#### CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

Symptoms and signs of a PDA are the consequence of leftto-right shunting, with the magnitude of the shunt dependent upon size of the communication and relationship between systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances. In this regard, it is similar to other types of high-pressure shunts, which include those across the ventricular septum and others from the aorta.

## Large Patent Ductus Arteriosus

Aortic and pulmonary artery pressures are essentially equal when the PDA is large, and the magnitude and direction of shunting are dependent on changes in pulmonary vascular resistance, because systemic vascular resistance remains fairly constant after birth.R9 As neonatal pulmonary vascular resistance decreases, left-to-right shunting increases and severe heart failure develops within a month or so of birth. There is tachypnea, tachycardia, sweating, irritability, poor feeding, and slow weight gain.K4 Pulmonary edema and pneumonia or less severe, and recurrent respiratory infection may occur.

On examination, there is an overactive precordium, sometimes with a systolic thrill, and evidence of cardiac enlargement with a thrusting left ventricular apical impulse.A5 The pulse is jerky or frankly collapsing, and the pulse pressure is correspondingly wide. These features become more obvious when heart failure is medically controlled. On auscultation, there is a systolic murmur maximal in the pulmonary area, with late systolic accentuation and minimal spillover into diastole.R8 Occasionally the murmur is continuous, but sometimes with severe heart failure, no murmur is heard.M8 The first and second heart sounds are accentuated, and there is a third sound at the apex or a prominent mid-diastolic mitral flow murmur.R4 The liver enlarges and jugular venous pressure rises; frequently, rales are heard in the lung bases.

The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows left ventricular enlargement with deep Q and tall R waves in the left ventricular leads. There may be evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy with upright T waves in the right precordial leads and evidence of left atrial enlargement with widened P waves. The chest radiograph shows marked cardiomegaly and plethora with or without interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema. The pulmonary trunk is enlarged, as is the ascending aorta. The echocardiogram shows left atrial enlargement. The ductus may be visualized with twodimensional echocardiography.

In some infants with a large PDA, heart failure may be less marked, presumably because pulmonary vascular resistance does not fall to the usual level. Histologic changes of pulmonary vascular disease may develop within the first few months of life. These changes may occur in infants in whom heart failure is controlled medically and the ductus is not closed by intervention. These patients become asymptomatic, and the left-to-right shunt diminishes. The murmur becomes purely systolic, the pulmonary component of the second heart sound is markedly accentuated, the apical mid-diastolic murmur disappears, and the pulse loses its jerky quality. Right ventricular hypertrophy becomes dominant in the ECG, the heart becomes smaller on the chest radiograph, and pulmonary plethora disappears. Cyanosis develops as pulmonary vascular resistance increases above systemic vascular resistance (Eisenmenger syndrome), typically earlier than with ventricular septal defect (see Chapter 35).E5 Differential cyanosis may be noted, with blueness of the feet and sometimes the left hand, but not of the face or right hand.

#### Moderate-Sized Patent Ductus Arteriosus

Left-to-right shunt in moderate-sized PDA is regulated by size of the ductus arteriosus. In this setting, pulmonary artery pressure is only moderately elevated. As neonatal pulmonary vascular resistance declines, the shunt increases and heart failure may occur. By the second or third month of life, however, compensatory left ventricular hypertrophy is usually associated with clinical improvement and stabilization of symptoms. Physical development may be somewhat retarded, and breathlessness and fatigue may occur, but many patients with moderate-sized PDA remain essentially asymptomatic until the second decade of life or later.

On examination, the pulse is jerky, the precordium is mildly overactive, and the left ventricle is palpable at the apex in association with some cardiac enlargement. The classic continuous murmur is usually heard by age 2 to 3 months, although it varies in intensity.L3 The murmur is generally loud and often masks the heart sounds. It is maximal over the pulmonary artery and radiates upward beneath the mid-third of the clavicle. As described by Gibson in 1900, "it begins after the commencement of the first sound—it persists through the second sound and dies away gradually during the long pause. The murmur is rough and thrilling. It begins softly and increases in intensity so as to reach its acme at or immediately after the occurrence of the second sound, and from that point gradually wanes until its termination." G1 Subnormal physical growth is common; Krovetz and Warden found body weight below the third percentile in 26% of 515 surgically proven cases.K4 The ECG may be relatively normal during infancy, but some degree of left ventricular hypertrophy develops in older children. The chest radiograph shows moderate cardiac enlargement and plethora and a prominent ascending aorta (in contrast to findings in patients with a large ventricular or atrial septal defect). In adults, the PDA may be calcified. It is rare for pulmonary vascular resistance to increase, and Eisenmenger syndrome does not develop.

## Small Patent Ductus Arteriosus

Left-to-right shunt is small in early life, and pulmonary vascular resistance decreases rapidly to normal after birth.

Left ventricular failure does not occur, and symptoms are absent in infancy and childhood. They may appear later in life, but usually attention is drawn to the condition by a murmur detected on physical examination.

Physical development is normal unless there is maternal rubella. The pulse is normal and the precordium not overactive. By age 2 to 3 months, a short systolic murmur is usually replaced by one that spills over into diastole, or it may be continuous in the second left intercostal space but less intense, and with less radiation than when the ductus is moderate in size. The continuous murmur varies greatly in intensity between patients and sometimes is detectable only when the patient is sitting or standing upright. The ECG and chest radiograph are normal or nearly so.

#### Special Investigations

Most children and young adults with a PDA and a continuous murmur that is maximal in the second left intercostal space do not need preoperative invasive studies unless other defects are suspected; such studies may be necessary for diagnosis in atypical cases. Instead, two-dimensional echocardiography is usually performed and will image the ductus arteriosus. It has identified so-called silent ductus (a PDA without auscultatory findings).H11 Managing patients with isolated silent ductus remains controversial, although endarteritis has been reported and may be an indication for closure.B2 Cardiac catheterization and angiography are indicated if the echocardiogram suggests elevated pulmonary vascular resistance or associated cardiac anomalies.

#### NATURAL HISTORY

Isolated PDA in term infants occurs in approximately 1 in 2000 live births and accounts for 5% to 10% of all types of congenital heart disease.M10 It is twice as common in femalesC2 and may occur in siblings, suggesting a genetic factor. It is particularly common when the mother contracts rubella during the first trimester of pregnancy and may then be associated with multiple peripheral pulmonary artery stenoses and renal artery stenosis.

Because of the early introduction of surgical treatment of PDA, which antedated methods for establishing the diagnosis, its natural history is not completely documented.

#### Spontaneous Closure

Campbell's study concluded that spontaneous closure of isolated PDA occurs in 0.6% of patients per year and that this rate is fairly constant through the first 4 decades of life.C2 If this is accepted, it means that in approximately 20% of patients, the PDA will have closed by age 40. His study involved only patients diagnosed beyond age 12 months and was based entirely on clinical findings, closure being assumed to have occurred when a typical murmur was no longer audible, regardless of size of the ductus or initial right-to-left shunt. Other experience suggests that the closure rate is much lower, and it is generally agreed that spontaneous closure is uncommon beyond age 3 to 5 months in full-term infants. Delayed closure of the ductus arteriosus in preterm infants is, however, common (see Special Situations and Controversies later in this chapter).

#### Pulmonary Vascular Disease

Prevalence and type of pulmonary vascular disease in patients with large PDA are similar to those in patients with large ventricular septal defect (see "Pulmonary Vascular Disease" under Morphology in Section I of Chapter 35).

#### Rupture

Rupture of both non-aneurysmal and aneurysmal PDA has been reported.C13,M5

#### Death

Mortality with untreated PDA in infancy is high, and it has been estimated that, particularly in earlier eras, 30% of patients born with an isolated PDA died within the first year.C2,H5 Risk of death is highest in the first few months of life (see "Patent Ductus Arteriosus in Preterm Infants" under Special Situations and Controversies later in this chapter).

After infancy, the annual death rate of patients with untreated PDA decreases dramatically to approximately 0.5% per year.C2 By the third decade, the death rate has increased to about 1% per year; by the fourth decade, 1.8% per year; and in subsequent decades, as high as 4% per year.C2 As a result, approximately 60% of patients with PDA die by age 45. Most of the deaths in older patients are related to development of intractable left ventricular failure secondary to long-standing volume overload.

## Modes of Death

In infants with a large PDA, mode of death is usually heart failure. Recurrent respiratory infection terminating in pneumonia is a less common mode. In those with a large PDA who survive infancy, death is usually due to acute or chronic right heart failure secondary to development of severe pulmonary vascular disease by the second or third decade of life.

In patients with a moderate-sized PDA, mode of death from the third and fourth decades onward is heart failure. Excluding infants and deaths from pulmonary vascular disease, Campbell estimated that heart failure was the cause of death in 30% of patients.C2

Infective endarteritis occurs mainly as a complication of small and moderate-sized PDA. It rarely occurs when the ductus is large. In the preantibiotic era, endarteritis was responsible for approximately 45% of deaths in patients with surgically untreated PDA.A2,C2,K2 After the advent of antibiotics, few patients died from this cause, although they remained subject to recurrent infection. In the current era, risk of infective endarteritis is extremely low.F4

# TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

## Closure of Patent Ductus Arteriosus

Unless the patient is an infant in severe heart failure or elderly, an intraarterial monitoring catheter is usually unnecessary. After the usual induction of anesthesia and preparations for operation (see Chapter 4), the patient is positioned on the right side (Fig. 37-3, *A*). A small roll or pillow is placed under the mid-chest. The patient is positioned near the surgeon's side of the table, but not so much so that the first assistant across the table from the surgeon cannot see into the field well and work comfortably.

### *Posterolateral Thoracotomy*

A curving skin incision is made, centered about 1 to 2 cm below the tip of the scapula. In infants and young children, the incision is really a lateral one, because only the latissimus dorsi and posterior part of the serratus anterior are divided. In older children, the incision is posterolateral, extending posterosuperiorly to overlie the lower 1 or 2 cm of the trapezius, which is also incised. In patients who are in the second decade of life or older, the incision extends from the anterior axillary line around the scapula and up midway between the spine and posterior scapular border over the lower 3 to 4 cm of the trapezius.

After incising the latissimus dorsi (and trapezius if indicated), the scapula is elevated with a retractor and the ribs are counted from the top down to the fifth rib. Identifying the appropriate rib or intercostal space requires an accurate point of reference. There are three possible points of reference (the second and third are often more reliable than the first):

■ First rib: The surgeon passes his or her left hand under the serratus and identifies the first rib by palpation.

- Second rib: The serratus anterior attaches superiorly to the second rib. The surgeon identifies this attachment using upward traction on the scapular retractor, which makes the prominent posterior border of this muscle taut.
- Second intercostal space: This is usually appreciably wider than the third intercostal space.

Counting down from the reference point, the fifth rib is identified and scored. Only then are the posterior and midportions of the serratus anterior divided so that the muscle incision may be directly over the fifth rib. The fourth interspace may be opened with a knife or cautery or the chest may be entered through the superior part of the bed of the nonresected fifth rib. With the latter method, the periosteum over the rib is incised, and its superior portion is elevated from the front and back with a periosteal elevator.

After the incision in the rib cage is extended anteriorly and posteriorly, the rib retractor is placed with the ratcheted portion anteriorly (Fig. 37-3, *B*). The retractor is opened only partially at first, but as the operation proceeds, it is gradually opened further to obtain adequate exposure.

A retractor is gently placed on the lung, and a vertical incision is made in the mediastinal pleura over the proximal descending thoracic aorta (see Fig. 37-3, *B*).1 Traction sutures are placed on the anterior and posterior pleural flaps. The lung retractor is removed, moist gauze is placed over the lung, and the anterior pleural traction sutures are pulled taut and anchored to the retractor or drapes. The vein that traverses the aorta obliquely on its anterior surface is divided. The PDA is completely dissected from the surrounding tissue (Fig. 37-3, *C-E*). In small infants, particular care is taken to be certain that the structure identified as the PDA connects the aorta and pulmonary artery, and that it is not the LPA or distal aortic arch. As dissection proceeds, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve is not isolated, although it should be clearly visualized behind the areolar tissue over the LPA, just inferior and posterior to the PDA (see Fig. 37-3, *C*).

When the PDA is an uncomplicated one, either division or ligation may be performed. Both techniques, when done properly, ensure complete closure with low risk.

**Division** When division is elected and the patient is an infant or young child, one straight and two angled finetoothed Potts ductus clamps are selected. In teenagers and adults, longer-handled vascular clamps are used. At this time, and particularly in older children and adults, the anesthesiologist reduces arterial blood pressure (see Chapter 4) and maintains it below baseline level until the clamps are removed.

The straight clamp is placed completely across the aortic end of the PDA, making sure that its tip does not grasp the recurrent laryngeal nerve or other soft tissue posterior to the ductus. The clamp is placed in the surgeon's left hand and is gently pulled anteriorly. One angled ductus clamp is placed on the aortic side of the straight clamp and usually on the aorta contiguous with the PDA rather than on the ductus itself. The straight clamp is removed. With the clamp on the aortic origin of the PDA, which is held in the surgeon's right hand, the other angled clamp is placed with the left hand on

Gross made an anterolateral thoracotomy incision, placed the pleural incision midway between the phrenic and vagus nerves, and retracted the vagus nerve posteriorly.G11-G14 Exposure is probably less optimal with this approach, although it may be appropriate in small patients and those with variations of situs such as mesocardia and dextrocardia.

**Figure 37-3** Closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) by division. **A,** Posterolateral incision in a patient properly positioned for operation. **B,** Rib retractor has been placed and opened slowly to its final width. Lung is gently retracted anteriorly. Vertical incision is made in mediastinal pleura, and traction sutures are placed on pleural flaps. Left vagus and left recurrent laryngeal nerves are identified and protected. **C,** Areolar tissues and pericardial lappet anterior to ductus are elevated with forceps and sharply dissected free of it. Care is taken to leave the adventitial layer of ductus undisturbed.

the pulmonary end of the ductus. To avoid dislodgment from the clamp and retraction into the pericardial cavity, the clamp must grasp *only* the ductus and not any of the lappet of pericardium or other tissue. This clamp, like the one on the aortic end, is "squeezed" onto the pulmonary artery as much as possible when it is being placed to give added length to the ductus. The ductus is divided midway between these clamps by Potts scissors or a scalpel (Fig. 37-3, *F*).

The aortic end of the PDA is oversewn with two rows of 5-0 or 6-0 polypropylene suture placed as a whip stitch (Fig. 37-3, *G*). The pulmonary end is similarly closed. Although accurate suturing is of obvious importance, the key to a safe repair is separating the clamps widely enough so that a substantial cuff of ductus remains beyond them after the ductus is divided. This permits placing additional sutures for hemostasis.

![](_page_7_Picture_2.jpeg)

**D,** After anterior surface of ductus has been freed far enough medially so that junction of PDA with left pulmonary artery is visible, superior and inferior surfaces are similarly dissected. Right-angled clamp is passed behind ductus. Clamp stretches areolar tissue behind ductus, which is then grasped with forceps and cut away. **E,** This maneuver is repeated several times and creates a space behind ductus. **F,** Clamps are placed at aortic and pulmonary ends of ductus (see text), and it is divided midway between them. **G,** Aortic end of ductus is oversewn with two rows of 5-0 or 6-0 polypropylene suture. Clamp on aortic end of ductus is generally kept in place following closure and provides traction to expose pulmonary end, which is then oversewn in a similar fashion. Clamps are then released. **Figure 37-3, cont'd**

The clamp on the pulmonary end of the divided ductus generally is removed first. The clamp on the aortic end is then removed, and a sponge is placed between the divided ends and held in place with pressure for several minutes. Unless the original placement of the clamps has been faulty or the suture closure is inadequate, the bleeding that occurs when the clamps are released usually stops within this period. If not, and if there is no major bleeding that would require replacing one or both clamps, a 5-0 polypropylene suture approximating the adventitia from both sides of the suture line usually controls the bleeding. A pledget of absorbable porcine gelatin sponge is left between the divided ends of the ductus to prevent the suture lines from rubbing against each other.

**Ligation** If the situation is uncomplicated and the PDA is pliable, it may be ligated rather than divided. The technique is basically that described by Blalock in 1946.B9 The operation proceeds exactly as described for ductal division until the PDA is completely dissected. Using a doublearmed 5-0 or 6-0 polypropylene suture, adventitial stitches are placed into the accessible superior, inferior, and anterior aspects of the aortic wall contiguous with the PDA (Fig. 37-4, *A*). One end of the suture is passed beneath the ductus, and the ends are held. A similar stitch is placed on the pulmonary end of the ductus (Fig. 37-4, *B*). The aortic stitch is pulled up and snugly tied, and then the suture at the pulmonary end is tied. This leaves a long length of ductus between the tied sutures. Finally, a transfixion ligature of 5-0 or 6-0 polypropylene is placed at the middle of the ductus, and the ends are passed in the opposite direction around the ductus and tied to complete the ligation (Figs. 37-4, *C* to *F*).

The mediastinal pleura is closed with interrupted sutures, leaving a small opening at each end. In the unlikely event that there is substantial bleeding from the suture lines after operation, this closure will contain it and may be lifesaving.

The rib retractor is removed, a small catheter is inserted into the posterior part of the pleural space through a stab wound in the sixth or seventh intercostal space at the midaxillary line, and suction of 15 to 25 cm water is placed on it. The ribs on either side of the incision are approximated with interrupted sutures. The muscles are individually sutured with a slowly absorbable synthetic material (polyglycolic acid), and the skin edges are approximated with a subcutaneous stitch. In infants, the chest tube may be removed in the operating room.

## *Transaxillary Muscle-Sparing Lateral Thoracotomy*

A 3- to 4-cm incision is made over the third intercostal space in the axilla. The serratus anterior is reflected inferiorly and laterally, and the pectoralis major is reflected anteriorly. The third intercostal space is entered and a rib retractor inserted. The lung is retracted anteriorly, and the pleura overlying the descending thoracic aorta is incised. The PDA is identified at its junction with the aorta, and the recurrent laryngeal nerve is identified and protected. The PDA is dissected circumferentially and is divided or ligated using the techniques just described. Alternatively, it may be occluded with a medium-sized surgical clip.C5 The lung is inflated as the chest is closed.

Fluid and air can be aspirated as the chest wall is closed with interrupted pericostal sutures, making a chest tube unnecessary. The muscle and soft tissue layers are approximated with a slowly absorbable synthetic suture (polyglycolic acid), and the skin edges are approximated with a subcutaneous stitch. This technique is applicable to premature infants, neonates, older children, and adults.G15,K1,M2,T5,T6

## Closure of Patent Ductus Arteriosus in Association with Repair of Intracardiac Lesions

Closure of a PDA may be required during operations to correct intracardiac anomalies that require the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). This occurs in two distinct clinical situations. When the PDA is an incidental finding and relatively small and restrictive, such as with a large ventricular septal defect, dissection of the ductus is usually performed after CPB has been established, because exposure of the adjacent aorta and pulmonary artery is facilitated when the heart is decompressed, and injury to the ductus or surrounding structures can be avoided. The technique for closure of the PDA under these circumstances is described in Technique of Operation in Chapter 35. In the second situation, as can occur in the neonate with transposition of the great arteries with intact ventricular septum, the ductus is large. It must be exposed and controlled before initiating CPB so that it can be ligated immediately after bypass is established.

## Closure of Patent Ductus Arteriosus in Older Adults

When a PDA requires closure in older adults, the aortic end is often calcified and the ductus very short. A technique using CPB described by Goncalves-Estella and colleaguesG4 and later by O'Donovan and BeckO1 is appropriate in this circumstance.

With the usual preparations (see Chapter 2), a median sternotomy is performed and the usual stay sutures and pursestring sutures placed. The aorta and pulmonary trunk are dissected apart. CPB is established with a single venous cannula, and cooling of the patient by the perfusate is begun. The head of the table is lowered to place the patient in a moderate Trendelenburg position. As the heart begins to slow from the cold perfusion, the ductus is obliterated by compressing the front wall of the LPA against it with the index finger. This is essential because otherwise ductal flow into the pulmonary artery will overdistend the pulmonary vascular bed and the right ventricle (this does not occur when the heart is ejecting adequately). When the nasopharyngeal temperature reaches 20°C to 22°C, the aorta is clamped and cold cardioplegic solution is infused into the aortic root or retrogradely into the coronary sinus (see "Technique of Retrograde Infusion" in Chapter 3). The perfusion temperature is stabilized at 20°C to 22°C, and flow is reduced to 0.5 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> . The finger is removed, the distal pulmonary trunk is opened anteriorly and longitudinally, and the incision is continued into the LPA opposite the ductus. (If external pressure on the LPA does not control ductal flow during CPB cooling, perfusion is temporarily reduced to a low level, and the pulmonary artery incision is made such that the finger can be placed directly over the ostium of the ductus to control flow from it into the LPA. CPB flow rate is then increased until cooling is completed.)

The intracardiac sucker is positioned within the LPA beyond the ductus to aspirate blood entering it. The ductal orifice is closed by placing and tying one or more pledgeted

**Figure 37-4** Closure of patent ductus arteriosus by ligation. **A,** Dissection has been completed as shown in Fig. 37-3. Adventitial pursestring suture of 5-0 or 6-0 polypropylene is placed around aortic end of ductus. **B,** Similar purse-string suture is placed around pulmonary end of ductus. **C,** The two purse-string sutures are snugly tied. Transfixion suture is placed through ductus. One end is passed beneath ductus. **D,** Other end of suture is passed beneath ductus in opposite direction, and the two ends are tied on anterior surface. **E,** Crosssectional diagram showing scheme for passing ends of suture. **F,** Transfixion suture has been tied, leaving a space between it and other sutures.

mattress sutures of 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene. This is usually readily accomplished because the pulmonary artery end of the ductus is rarely calcified, and the pulmonary artery tissues are strong enough to hold sutures well. If the orifice of the pulmonary artery end of the PDA is too large or immobile for this technique, an impervious patch of bovine pericardium, woven polyester, or polytetrafluorethylene can be used to close it, sewing the patch in place with continuous 4-0 or 5-0 polypropylene suture. Flows are then restored, the table leveled, and rewarming of the patient with the perfusate begun. Any leak from the ductus closure site is secured with additional sutures. The pulmonary arteriotomy is closed with a running stitch of fine polypropylene.

With strong suction on a venting catheter or needle that has been placed in the aortic root, the aortic clamp is released. The remainder of the operation is completed in the usual fashion (see "Completing Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2).

#### Closure of Patent Ductus Arteriosus in Premature Infants

Perioperative management and technique of operation are different when surgical closure of the ductus is indicated in the premature infant, most of whom weigh approximately 1000 g and some as little as 400 g. Precise management of ventilation, fluid administration, and body temperature, as well as a precise surgical technique, are essential for success.

Operation is usually performed in the neonatal intensive care unit. This simplifies the logistics and, when properly organized, can provide outcomes as good as those obtained in a conventional operating room.C10,E4

If the procedure is to be performed in the operating room, the infant is intubated in the neonatal nursery, and proper position of the tube is verified by a chest radiograph. The patient, covered by a plastic wrap blanket and cloth cap, is transported to the operating room in a prewarmed (37°C) transport isolette. The room is prewarmed to approximately 30°C, and the patient is placed on the right side on an infant operating table with overhead servocontrolled radiant warmers set at 37°C.

After preparation and draping, a left lateral incision of approximately 2.5 cm is made, cutting or reflecting the latissimus dorsi and posterior aspect of the serratus anterior. The chest is entered through the third or fourth interspace, and a small rib retractor is put into place. With a narrow malleable retractor, the lung is held forward by the first assistant. The ductus is usually large but is variable in position. It may course superiorly as well as anteriorly from the aorta and be immediately adjacent to the distal aortic arch. In this location it can be easily mistaken for the arch. It may course directly anteriorly and be well inferior to the arch.

The friable vascular tissue makes the usual complete dissection of the ductus inadvisable.G15,K3,M7,T6 The mediastinal pleura is incised with fine scissors just superior to the aortic end of the ductus and then just inferior to it. The tissue plane is developed by gently spreading fine scissors. As the inferior tissue plane is developed, the back wall (or right side) of the ductus is seen; no attempt is made to pass an instrument around it. The ductus is temporarily and lightly occluded with a fine forceps, and a pulse oximeter on the foot confirms that it is the ductus, not aorta, and that the aortic arch is intact without interruption or coarctation. A medium-sized hemoclip on a holder is positioned well across the ductus at its aortic end; the tip of the clip must be *beyond* the ductus posteriorly. The adventitia of the aorta may be grasped and gently retracted toward the surgeon as the clip is placed. By closing the holder the ductus is closed.

A 12F catheter is brought out through a stab wound in the chest wall and placed on suction. Placing a chest tube is usually not necessary. The chest wall is closed with two pericostal sutures. The muscles are closed with a continuous fine absorbable suture (polyglycolic acid), and the closure is completed with a subcuticular stitch of fine absorbable sutures. When the procedure is performed in the operating room, the infant is transferred back to the neonatal intensive care unit in a prewarmed transfer isolette.

# SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Care after division or ligation of PDA is simple and follows the principles described in Chapter 5. The patient is usually extubated and the drainage catheter removed in the operating room or within a few hours of leaving it. When the transaxillary muscle-sparing technique is used, most patients can be discharged from the hospital within 24 hours.C5,H4 When the operation is done with CPB, care is also simple and usual (see Chapter 5).

#### RESULTS

#### Early (Hospital) Death

Within 10 years of Gross and Hubbard's first successful case, hospital mortality for surgical closure of uncomplicated PDA had become very low. In 1951, Gross and Longino reported eight deaths (1.9%; CL 1%-3%) among their first 412 surgically treated cases.G14 In 1955, Ash and Fischer reported no deaths (0%; CL 0%-6%) among 116 consecutive children (ages 4 months to 14 years) undergoing surgical closure.A5 Other similar experiences reinforce the idea that the operation is safe and that hospital mortality approaches zero.M6

#### Incremental Risk Factors for Early Death

No risk factors for early death can be consistently identified. Operation in infancy or childhood, associated congenital anomalies, pulmonary hypertension, and mild or moderate increase of pulmonary vascular resistance do not increase the risk of hospital death, nor does the surgical technique used. However, by considering the entire span of time since Gross first successfully closed a PDA in 1938, certain situations can be presumed to increase risk.

When pulmonary vascular disease is severe and the shunt is bidirectional or dominantly right to left, risk is high; 5 of 14 such patients (36%; CL 21%-53%) died in the hospital in the early Mayo Clinic experience.E5 Death was due to hemorrhage during operation (from the pulmonary artery suture line, because pulmonary artery pressure after closure was *higher* than systemic arterial pressure and the pulmonary artery was large and thin walled), or it occurred suddenly some days later without any demonstrable cause.E5 However, no distinction with regard to reactivity of the pulmonary vascular bed was made in these patients. Thus, it is likely that with preoperative provocative testing, a subgroup of patients could be identified that would have lower operative risk.

When pulmonary vascular disease is mild or moderate, and thus when a large left-to-right shunt is present, there is no increased risk. Even in the early era, 16 among 271 patients undergoing repair of PDA at the Mayo Clinic had severe pulmonary hypertension but only mild or moderate pulmonary vascular disease and a large left-to-right shunt, and there were no (0%; CL 0%-11%) early or late deaths.E5

Older age minimally increases risk of surgical closure even in the absence of severe pulmonary vascular disease. This increase is principally from the technical problems posed by the friable and often calcified ductal wall in older patients, and the tendency of the long-standing volume overload of the left ventricle to predispose them to fatal arrhythmias. The mildly increased risk in the older age group is illustrated by the report of Black and Goldman in 1972, which described one death (2%; CL 0.2%-6%) in 53 adults (aged 14-55 years) undergoing surgical closure of a PDA. Death occurred at early reoperation for postoperative bleeding from a tear in the aorta.B8 In recent years, the technical problems in older patients have been eased by use of an open technique (see Technique of Operation earlier in this chapter).

#### Time-Related Survival

Life expectancy is normal after surgical closure of an uncomplicated PDA in infancy or childhood. When moderate or severe pulmonary vascular disease has developed preoperatively, late deaths may result from its progression, as is the case in children with ventricular septal defect (see "Pulmonary Hypertension" under Results in Section I of Chapter 35).

When the operation is performed in adults with advanced chronic heart failure, premature late death is at times unavoidable. This is because the cardiomyopathy secondary to longstanding left ventricular volume overload is irreversible in some patients, in a way entirely analogous to the situation in patients with long-standing aortic valve regurgitation (see "Left Ventricular Structure and Function" under Results in Chapter 12).

## Symptomatic and Functional Status

Disappearance of the signs and symptoms of heart failure is dramatic after surgical closure of a large PDA. Ash and Fischer recount that the marked hepatomegaly and splenomegaly in a 3-year-old girl with cardiac cachexia and advanced heart failure were no longer detectable 3 hours after surgical closure of the ductus, and cardiac size on chest radiography had returned to near normal within 4 months.A5

## Physical Development

It has been presumed that when a large isolated PDA is closed in infancy, growth pattern becomes normal. However, growth retardation, particularly in regard to height, tends to persist, particularly when the operation is delayed beyond infancy or if the child has a rubella syndrome.E7 The same may occur after repair of ventricular septal defect (see "Physical Development" under Results in Section I of Chapter 35).

## Recurrence of Ductal Patency

Currently, prevalence of recurrent or persistent ductal patency approaches zero when division or appropriate ligation techniques are used.L6,M6 In an earlier era, it did occur. In 1965, Jones reported 12 patients (20%; CL 14%-26%) with recurrent or persistent ductal patency out of 61 patients who had ductal ligation with heavy tape.J5 Later, it became less common; Panagopoulos and colleagues reported only four cases (0.4%; CL 0.2%-0.8%) among 936 patients undergoing ductal closure, mostly by ligation.P2 Trippestad and Efskind reported 20 among 639 traced cases (3.1%; CL 2.4%-4.0%).T7

#### False Aneurysm

False aneurysm is a rare complication of surgical ductal closure that usually occurs after ligation rather than division.P3,P10,R7 Only rare cases of false aneurysm have been reported after ductal division, and these probably resulted from technical errors or infection.C12,E3,H1,R5 Development of a false aneurysm is an indication for urgent reoperation.

## Left Vocal Cord Paralysis

Transient and occasionally permanent left vocal cord paralysis resulting from manipulation or injury of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve occurs in 1% to 4% of patients following division or ligation of a PDA.F2,M6 Prevalence is higher among infants with low birth weight.B7,D2,F2,Z1

## Phrenic Nerve Paralysis

Phrenic nerve paralysis with elevation of the hemidiaphragm after PDA closure occurs in approximately 4% of patients.F2 It usually occurs on the left side, usually in infants, and most frequently in preterm babies.F2 It is not necessarily due to surgical damage to the phrenic nerve, because it may develop on the right side. It often regresses spontaneously but may persist for many months or indefinitely.

#### Chylothorax

Chylothorax is a rare complication of surgical ductal closure. Its management is discussed in Section II of Chapter 5.

## INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

*Persistent* PDA is an indication for closure, and the optimal age for operating is during the first year of life.A5 Patients, either term or preterm, with *prolonged* PDA require closure in early life only when a large left-to-right shunt results in heart failure. In practice, this means that in term infants in the first month of life, PDA closure is indicated only when symptoms of heart failure are present. (For a discussion of the special situation in preterm infants, see "Patent Ductus Arteriosus in Preterm Infants" under Special Situations and Controversies later in this chapter.)

Beyond the first month of life, prophylactic closure of the PDA is indicated. In the absence of symptoms, operation may be delayed until about age 6 months. However, closure is indicated at any time before this when symptoms of heart failure or failure to thrive persist despite intense medical treatment. Older age is not a contraindication to closure of an isolated PDA in the absence of severe pulmonary vascular disease.

Severe pulmonary vascular disease is a contraindication to closure. The criteria of inoperability in this setting are the same as described for patients with ventricular septal defect (see Indications for Operation in Section I of Chapter 35). In the case of patients with PDA, the ductus may be temporarily occluded at operation; if pulmonary artery pressure does not decrease but remains severely elevated with no increase in aortic pressure, the shunt is *not* dominantly left to right. Closure of the ductus, therefore, will not reduce pulmonary artery pressure or left atrial pressure and therefore cannot trigger a favorable change in pulmonary vascular resistance. Repair is contraindicated in this situation. With preoperative provocative testing, abandoning closure in the operating room should be uncommon.

Until recently, indications for closure of PDA were indications for *operative* closure. This is probably still true in many institutions, but percutaneous closure must also be considered (see "Percutaneous [Catheter] Closure of Patent Ductus Arteriosus" under Special Situations and Controversies later in this chapter).

# SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

#### Patent Ductus Arteriosus in Preterm Infants

# *Historical Note*

In 1963, both Powell and De Cancq, independently, were apparently the first to close a PDA in a preterm infant by operation.D3,P7 Subsequent improvement in the cardiovascular status of preterm infants after surgical closure of a PDA has been clearly demonstrated.B3,J1

#### *Clinical Features and Diagnostic Criteria*

The preterm infant with a PDA may have a continuous murmur, and under these circumstances diagnosis is made with confidence.C8,E6 The shunt is considered large enough to be important if there is pulmonary plethora and cardiomegaly on the chest radiograph, if peripheral pulses are bounding, or if by echocardiography, the left atrial–aortic ratio is 1.5 or greater and Doppler color flow interrogation demonstrates a large left-to-right shunt.J4

A systolic murmur is less specific for PDA, but the diagnosis is made clinically if the murmur is associated with a hyperactive precordium, increased pulse pressure, or positive chest radiograph or echocardiogram. A few preterm infants have these positive clinical and laboratory findings of PDA without a murmur.M8,T1

## *Natural History*

A high proportion of preterm infants have prolonged patency of the ductus arteriosus after birth. The frequency increases with decreasing gestational age and decreasing birth weight.H7 Siassi and colleagues reported the presence of a PDA (based on presence of a long systolic murmur) in 77% of premature infants with a gestational age of 28 to 30 weeks, 44% with a gestational age of 31 to 33 weeks, and 21% with a gestational age of 34 to 36 weeks.S3 Birth weights of less than 1000 g, 1000 to 1500 g, and 1500 to 2000 g were associated with a PDA prevalence of 83%, 47%, and 27%, respectively. Frequency of hemodynamically important PDA is less, however: approximately 40% when the birth weight is less than 1000 g and 10% when it is less than 1750 g.E6,V2

A PDA has the same hemodynamic effects in preterm infants as in term infants, as evidenced by collapsing pulses and radiographic evidence of increased pulmonary blood flow, left atrial enlargement, and cardiomegaly. Furthermore, experimental studies in preterm lambs have shown that the left-to-right shunt through the open ductus is associated with reduced effective systemic blood flow and organ hypoperfusion.B4 This has led to the hypothesis that necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants may be associated with a large PDA, which is supported by results of a randomized trial of ductal closure in preterm babies and by other studies.C3,V2

A strong correlation exists between patency of the ductus arteriosus and idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome, although these may not be causally related.E1,E2,T1 There is also an association between fluid administration and ductal patency; thus, PDA is less frequent in neonatal units that restrict fluids in preterm infants.B5

#### *Technique of Operation*

See Technique of Operation earlier in this chapter.

#### *Special Features of Postoperative Care*

Because surgical closure of a PDA is only one facet of care of a preterm infant, the patient is returned to the care of the neonatologist in the neonatal intensive care unit. The drainage catheter may be left until mechanical ventilation is no longer necessary, because pneumothorax occasionally develops in preterm infants maintained on a ventilator.

## *Early Results*

Hospital mortality is approximately 10% to 20%.H2,P1,P5,T8 It is not related to the interval between birth and operation, but, as in other circumstances in preterm infants, it is probably related to birth weight and gestational age. Death may be from continuing respiratory distress, intracranial hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, or a diffuse coagulopathy,B10,P5 but it rarely occurs during the immediate perioperative period. In low-birth-weight preterm neonates, postoperative morbidity includes bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and retinopathy.N1 There is no clear evidence that prevalence of intracranial hemorrhage is increased by surgical closure of the ductus.S6 Whether ligation of the PDA is causally linked to these adverse outcomes remains to be determined.N1

Cardiac status usually improves immediately, and left atrial size is promptly reduced.B10 At least one randomized study indicates overall benefit of early surgical closure of a PDA in preterm infants weighing less than 1500 g and requiring mechanical ventilation.C11 Another randomized study of infants weighing 1000 g or less and requiring supplemental oxygen demonstrated reduction (*P* = .001) in necrotizing enterocolitis among those treated by early ligation.C3

## *Late Results*

Among preterm infants requiring PDA closure, only half the hospital survivors are well 1 to 5 years later.B10,D4 About one third have bronchopulmonary dysplasia on chest radiograph, with variable clinical findings. About one sixth have more severe complications, such as retrolental fibroplasia, blindness, and cerebral palsy.B10,D4

## *Indications for Operation*

Recent publications have questioned the efficacy of PDA closure in preterm infants, whether by surgery or by pharmacologic therapy.B6,N2 The analyses performed in these publications rely on review and meta-analysis of existing historical literature pertaining to management of PDA in premature infants. The retrospective nature of these analyses incorporates major assumptions and limits the veracity of the conclusions. The authors of these studies acknowledge that there currently are no randomized controlled prospective trials evaluating surgical closure, pharmacologic closure, and conservative medical management not aimed at closure, and that such studies are the only way to resolve this question definitively. Notwithstanding these opinions, the overwhelming consensus is that closure should be actively pursued in preterm infants with hemodynamically important PDA. Indications for operative closure of a PDA include respiratory distress (ventilator dependency and need for high FIO2 in the absence of important shunt) and demonstration of a large PDA (collapsing pulses, left atrial enlargement by echocardiography, and a large Qp/Q s by radionucleotide scanning). In many centers, closure is reserved for infants who do not respond to medical management, including a course of indomethacin or ibuprofen therapy, and for infants in whom pharmacologic therapy is contraindicated.F7,H9,J3,O2,P4,V3 Failure of indomethacin treatment may approach 40% to 50%, particularly in lowbirth-weight infants (<800 g).P1,P5,T8 Surgical ligation should be considered the primary form of treatment in small preterm infants who have persistent cardiopulmonary compromise after pharmacologic therapy or an increased risk for development of complications from this therapy.C3,G10,P5,J3

## Percutaneous (Catheter) Closure of Patent Ductus Arteriosus

Technical improvements and operator experience have made percutaneous closure of PDA an intervention of proven efficacy. Percutaneous closure is generally contraindicated in patients weighing less than 6 kg. Device closure was effective in 58 patients weighing 3.6 to 6.0 kg, but complication rates led these authors to conclude that surgical closure is first-line therapy.A1 Two case reports document device closure in infants weighing 2.2 and 1.7 kg, but it is not recommended.N3,P9 In earlier years, approximately 65% of patients had complete ablation of the shunt with this technique.A4,R3 Currently, closure can be achieved in a high percentage of patients with umbrella or button coils or plugs.B11,L4,L5,M4,R6,S2,S4,T2 Effective occlusion (no or trivial residual shunt) can be accomplished in up to 94% of patients.F4,M1,R1,U1 Procedures are performed under local anesthesia and on an outpatient basis in many centers.F3,M11,M13,P8,W1 Procedural mortality has been extremely low (1 of 1640 procedures [0.061%; CL 0.01%-0.21%] reviewed by Fortescue and colleagues).F4 In this group of patients, embolization of the closure device occurred in 80 patients (4.9%; CL 4.3%- 5.5%) and was successfully retrieved in 70. Aortic or LPA narrowing not requiring intervention occurred in 32 patients (2.0%; CL 1.6%-2.4%), significant hemolysis in 12 (0.73%; CL 0.52%-1.0%), and inguinal pseudoaneurysm or loss of pulse in 18 (1.1%; CL 0.83%-1.4%). Overall occurrence of minor complications was 8.8%.F4 Procedural failure did not occur when PDA size was smaller than 1.5 mm. Infective endarteritis occurred in one patient, but follow-up to date is limited and variable in the reviewed studies. It is thus impossible to estimate the true risk of infective endarteritis with these techniques.F4

The ultimate role of outpatient closure of a PDA will be determined by its costs compared with those of operative closure, reproducibility of the results obtained, prevalence of complete and permanent closure, and occurrence of late complications resulting from a device residing in the ductus arteriosus.F3,G6,G7,P1 Currently in patients with a PDA of large diameter or short length, surgical closure is advisable.

#### Thoracoscopic Closure of Patent Ductus Arteriosus

An alternative to percutaneous catheter closure of a PDA is thoracoscopic closure without thoracotomy. It is performed under general anesthesia using three or four incisions 3 to 7 mm in length in the left hemithorax.L1,L2 The surgical field is viewed on a video screen. Once the ductus is dissected from the surrounding tissue, one or more clips are applied to close it. The technique has been used in neonates, children of all ages, and adults.B12,C7,H10,L1 In the experience of Laborde and colleagues with 332 consecutive pediatric patients, mortality was zero (CL 0%-0.57%) and morbidity minimal.L1 Three patients with persistent ductal patency required surgical closure. Subsequent series have confirmed the safety of the procedure, with no operative deaths.D7,V1 When compared with open operation, more complications, particularly recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, occurred with the thoracoscopic technique.
