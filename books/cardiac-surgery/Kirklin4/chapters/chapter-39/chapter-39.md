## DEFINITION

Pulmonary stenosis and intact ventricular septum is a form of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction in which the stenosis can be valvar, infundibular, or both. Isolated infundibular stenosis is unusual. This chapter concerns primarily valvar pulmonary stenosis, with or without infundibular stenosis. When neonates present with the most severe form of this defect, the term *neonatal critical pulmonary stenosis* is used. When patients present beyond the neonatal period or in early infancy, the term *pulmonary stenosis* is used.

## HISTORICAL NOTE

In 1913, as described by Dumont,D7 Doyen first attempted to surgically relieve pulmonary stenosis in a 20-year-old woman who, in retrospect, is thought to have had infundibular obstruction. Thirty-five years later, in December 1948, Sellors performed a successful closed transventricular instrumental pulmonary valvotomy, closely following Doyen's technique.S2 Brock performed three successful closed valvotomies in early 1948.B5 These patients probably all had tetralogy of Fallot. Blalock and Kieffer applied this procedure to patients with pulmonary stenosis and intact ventricular septum soon thereafter, reporting 19 patients and two hospital deaths.B4 Swan and colleagues surgically corrected pulmonary stenosis and intact ventricular septum by an open technique in about 1953, approaching the valve through a pulmonary arteriotomy during circulatory arrest, with the patient rendered moderately hypothermic by surface cooling.S10 Other techniques evolved.H5,L3,M12,S7

Kirklin's experiences with closed valvotomy at Mayo Clinic led to an appreciation of the importance of acquired infundibular obstruction caused by hypertrophyK5 and the need for a pump-oxygenator system that would allow relief by open operation.K4 When cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) became available in 1955, most surgeons began to use it to support patients during open valvotomy.

Surgical treatment of pulmonary stenosis was challenged in 1982 when Kan and colleagues reported successful percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty.K1 This method of therapy is now applied to patients of all ages, and is, with the important exception of the morphologic variant called *pulmonary valvar dysplasia,*K7 the initial procedure of choice.C1,C3,L1,P1,Z1

## AGE CONSIDERATIONS

Symptoms, signs, and treatment of valvar pulmonary stenosis in the neonate presenting in severe distress during the first few days of life have long been recognized as different from those of patients presenting later in life. Interrelationships exist between neonatal valvar pulmonary stenosis and intact ventricular septum and pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum. Now that percutaneous techniques are used for therapy, different groups of physicians, as a rule, care for valvar pulmonary stenosis in patients presenting for treatment for the first time as adults and those presenting in early childhood. For all these reasons, this subject seems best approached according to age categories.

## **Section I Critical Valvar Pulmonary Stenosis in Neonates**

## MORPHOLOGY

## Pulmonary Valve

The pulmonary valve is commonly a uniform fibrous cone with a circular, central, and stenotic orifice and two or three ridges on its pulmonary arterial side (Fig. 39-1). These ridges radiate from the central orifice to the periphery and outline two or three cusps that correspond to pulmonary sinuses of Valsalva, which are usually well formed. The valvar diaphragm is considerably thicker than normal cusp tissue, particularly around the ostium, but it is mobile.G8 Thickening is produced by an increase in myxomatous tissue. Obstruction may be due to thickened, shortened, and rigid cusp tissue with little or no commissural fusion, known as *pulmonary valvar dysplasia*. This was described in 1969 by Koretzky, Edwards, and colleaguesK7 and further characterized by Stamm, Anderson, and colleagues.S8 The right ventricular–pulmonary trunk junction *(anulus)* may be narrowed and the pulmonary trunk wall pulled inward or tethered at the site of commissural cusp attachment. The valve is often bicuspid. Although this condition may cause critical pulmonary stenosis in neonates, stenosis is typically moderate, a finding that is characteristic of Noonan syndrome.N2,R9

#### Pulmonary Arteries

Although it has been reported that in about 50% of neonates with critical pulmonary stenosis, right and left pulmonary arteries appear to be moderately or severely hypoplastic

**Figure 39-1** Specimen from a neonate with congenital valvar pulmonary stenosis and intact ventricular septum viewed through open, dilated pulmonary trunk. Fibrous cone with its central, very stenotic orifice; well-formed sinuses of Valsalva; and potential threecusp valve structure are typical. Moderate right ventricular hypoplasia coexists (see Fig. 39-3).

<sup>a</sup>Numbers in parentheses refer to grading of RV cavity size.

<sup>b</sup>Degree of hypoplasia of the pulmonary arteries was graded as 0 to −5. Hypoplasia was considered moderate or severe when graded -3, -4, or -5. Grading scheme was validated by comparison with actual measurements transformed to z values in patients for whom they were available. Key: LPA, Left pulmonary artery; RPA, right pulmonary artery; RV, right

when imaged, this has not been confirmed by other studies<sup>C2</sup> (Table 39-1). As a rule, the appearance of pulmonary arterial hypoplasia is probably secondary to low pulmonary blood flow, because the pulmonary arteries are usually normal in size within a few years in those who survive interventional treatment.<sup>C2</sup>

## Right Ventricle

Rarely, the right ventricular (RV) cavity is severely reduced in size. More commonly, mild or moderate reduction is present (Fig. 39-2). Reduction in cavity size relates in part to the amount of concentric RV hypertrophy produced by the RV outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction (Fig. 39-3).

Histologic appearance of the RV varies. Concentric RV hypertrophy is characterized by increased muscle cell size and diffuse fibrosis.<sup>Al</sup> The former is greater in the fibers near the endocardial surface; in some areas, muscle fibers can be seen to be disintegrating. Fibrosis is diffuse or patchy, but papillary muscles are the most severely affected. Fibrosis increases pari passu with hypertrophy and probably results from imbalance in the myocardial oxygen supply/demand ratio.<sup>Al</sup> Fibrosis of both endocardium and trabeculations is a marked feature when the RV is hypoplastic, contributing to poor compliance.

Neonates with critical pulmonary stenosis occasionally have severely enlarged RVs. This may represent coexisting important cardiomyopathy or (rarely) tricuspid valve disease. Prognosis is poor with or without valvotomy.

#### Tricuspid Valve

About 50% of neonates have normal tricuspid valve dimensions (within 2 standard deviations of the mean value for normal persons of the same size; see "Dimensions of

Normal Cardiac and Great Artery Pathways" in Chapter 1). In the others, diameter is smaller than normal; in less than 10% the tricuspid valve is severely hypoplastic (Fig. 39-4). When it is markedly hypoplastic, it is apt to be grossly abnormal as well, with abnormal chordal attachments and fused cusps. Otherwise, the cusps and chordae usually are normal.

#### Right Ventricular Coronary Artery Fistulae

About 10% of neonates with critical pulmonary stenosis have RV sinusoids, but only 2% have RV coronary arterial fistulae. RV-dependent coronary circulation in such hearts is rare.

#### Right Atrium

The right atrium is usually large. There is generally at least a patent foramen ovale, and right-to-left shunting across it is a major contributor to arterial desaturation exhibited by many of these neonates.

#### Morphologic Correlates

RV cavity size and tricuspid valve dimension are not highly correlated in this condition, but mild to moderate hypoplasia is the rule in both locations. H2 This is in contrast to pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum (see Morphology in Chapter 40), suggesting that reduction in RV cavity size in critical pulmonary stenosis is secondary to RV hypertrophy and thickening from outflow obstruction, rather than from genetic or developmentally induced hypoplasia. This is in harmony with the hypothesis that critical pulmonary stenosis develops relatively late in fetal life, in contrast to some types of pulmonary atresia.<sup>T3</sup>

### Coexisting Cardiac Conditions

Coexisting cardiac conditions are uncommon. Ebstein malformation, which occurs in about 5% of patients with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum, occurs in about 1% of those with critical pulmonary stenosis.H2

## CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

Neonates presenting with critical pulmonary stenosis and intact ventricular septum are usually critically ill, irritable, tachypneic, and severely hypoxic from right-to-left shunting at the atrial level. They usually present for treatment within a few days after birth and are generally of normal birth weight.H2 When the atrial septum is intact, which is uncommon, cyanosis is absent.

Tachycardia and severity of heart failure often make auscultatory findings nondiagnostic. Physical findings of tricuspid regurgitation may be present. Chest radiograph usually shows a normal or somewhat enlarged heart. Pulmonary stenosis with hypoplastic RV is associated with less electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of RV hypertrophy than expected.F2 Diminished RV potentials are due to smallness of the RV cavity rather than to diminished muscle mass.B6

In a critically ill neonate with clear lung fields and a large cardiac silhouette, two-dimensional echocardiography provides near-certain diagnosis. The thick stenotic pulmonary valve is visualized, the RV cavity is seen, and size and cusp thickness of the tricuspid valve can be determined. Additionally, the pulmonary artery branch diameter can be accurately estimated, and color Doppler imaging can suggest presence of coronary artery anomalies such as RV-to–coronary artery fistulae.

Cardiac catheterization is indicated in essentially all cases for both diagnostic reasons (e.g., to define coronary artery anomalies) and therapy, because balloon pulmonary valvotomy is currently the treatment of choice. Cardiac catheterization usually shows peak RV pressure higher than that in the left ventricle (LV) or systemic arteries. Rarely, and in the presence of severe heart failure, peak RV pressure is less than that in the systemic circulation, despite severe valvar stenosis.

Cineangiography provides precise information regarding site of stenosis, size of RV cavity and infundibulum, presence or absence of tricuspid regurgitation, morphology of the pulmonary trunk and right and left pulmonary arteries, and presence or absence of RV-to-coronary artery fistulae (Fig. 39-5). The tricuspid valve is competent in about 10% of patients, and in the other 90% it is moderately or severely

regurgitant (Hanley and colleagues and the Congenital Heart Surgeons Society: personal communication; 1992). Regurgitation, which is not well correlated with degree of RV hypertension (Fig. 39-6), is probably a manifestation of RV failure.

Currently, magnetic resonance and computed tomographic imaging are not routinely used in neonatal critical pulmonary stenosis, simply because these studies provide little added value to echocardiography and the mandatory cardiac catheterization. Recently, fetal echocardiography has been used to predict the postnatal fate of patients with critical

pulmonary stenosis.G3 The aim is to predict whether a two- or single-ventricle circulation will result following postnatal therapy. These techniques are more applicable to pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum but also have a role, albeit a lesser one, in pulmonary stenosis. Morphologic and physiologic characteristics identified at fetal echocardiographic interrogation can accurately predict the fate of the circulation following birth. These data can be used for planning postnatal therapy, parental counseling,K2 and possibly prenatal intervention.R10

## NATURAL HISTORY

Presentation is usually within the first 2 weeks, and mean age at operation in the series at Toronto Hospital for Sick Children was 3.9 days.C2,M7 Most neonates in whom severe hypoxia develops, with or without heart failure, die without treatment, although some may live for a few months.G5

## TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

## Percutaneous Balloon Valvotomy

The technique of percutaneous balloon valvotomy has been described in detail.L1,P1,Z1 Briefly, a guidewire is introduced via the femoral vein across the pulmonary valve and maneuvered through the ductus arteriosus into the descending aorta. A wire-guided balloon 1.2 to 1.3 times the measured size of the anulus is placed across the pulmonary anulus. The balloon is inflated rapidly two or three times.T1 Several case reports of fetal intervention for critical pulmonary stenosis using percutaneous balloon valvotomy have been reported, documenting technical success.G1,T4 Efficacy of the procedure has not yet been documented.

## Open Pulmonary Valvotomy Using Cardiopulmonary Bypass

When percutaneous balloon valvotomy has not been used or is unsuccessful, open pulmonary valvotomy using CPB is recommended.H2 The surgical procedures of closed pulmonary valvotomy and open valvotomy with simple inflow stasis have also given good results; however, they are not currently recommended in most circumstances.J2,M6 Operation may be performed using one or two venous cannulae and CPB with mild (32°C-34°C) or moderate (25°C-28°C) hypothermia as described in Chapter 2. A single venous cannula and mild hypothermia are chosen when a simple patent foramen ovale is present that will not be closed; two venous cannulae and moderate hypothermia are chosen when an atrial septal defect (ASD) will be closed.

Before establishing CPB, the ductus arteriosus is dissected and ligated immediately after initiating CPB. After establishing CPB and hypothermia, the aorta is clamped and cold cardioplegia administered (see "Cold Cardioplegia, Controlled Aortic Root Reperfusion, and [When Needed] Warm Cardioplegic Induction" in Chapter 3). Alternatively, operation may be done on the beating heart, without aortic clamping.

If two venous cannulae are used and an ASD is to be repaired, a small-caliber vent can be placed into the left side of the heart through a purse-string suture in the right pulmonary vein. Alternatively, the right atrium is opened through a small oblique incision, and a pump sump-sucker is placed across the foramen ovale and into the left atrium.

The pulmonary trunk is opened through a vertical incision, and fine stay sutures are placed on the edge of the incision for exposure. Two or three fused commissures can usually be seen, and these are opened with a knife, extending the incisions to the RV–pulmonary trunk junction. Because regurgitation is of less concern than residual narrowing, the incisions may be tailored to some extent to ensure that the valve has a wide opening. Portions of the valve are excised only when other methods fail to achieve a wide opening. Less commonly, the valve is dysplastic with three fully formed commissures and markedly thickened, even bulky, cusps. In this case, cusp debulking by partial resection of tissue is necessary to relieve obstruction. Rarely in neonates is there need to resect RV infundibular musculature. The pulmonary trunk is closed with one row of continuous 7-0 polypropylene suture. Usually, operation requires less than 15 minutes, and the aortic clamp, if used, is simply removed and de-airing accomplished. Remainder of the operation is completed in the usual manner (see "Completing Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2).

A patent foramen ovale, if present, is usually left open because the RV is very hypertrophied. The patient will benefit from allowing right-to-left atrial shunting until the RV remodels. If an ASD coexists, the decision is more complex because it is likely the patient will eventually develop significant left-to-right shunting through it once RV remodeling is complete. Judgment must be used in this setting. If there is concern that RV size and hypertrophy will result in perioperative RV failure, the ASD should be left open; it can be addressed at a later time once the RV has remodeled. If the RV is judged to be adequate, the ASD should be closed. Regardless of the initial decision, the physiology should be assessed carefully in the operating room following separation from CPB, and surgical readjustments (either opening or closing the ASD) made as necessary. Remainder of the operation is completed in the usual manner.

A concomitant systemic–pulmonary artery shunt may be added if PaO2 is severely reduced (<30 mmHg) after discontinuing CPB. The neonate usually comes to the operating room well resuscitated by prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). However, in the rare circumstance in which this is not the case, methods employed for seriously ill adult patients will probably improve results (see "Cold Cardioplegia, Controlled Aortic Root Reperfusion, and [When Needed] Warm Cardioplegic Induction" in Chapter 3).

Consideration should be given to placing a fine polyvinyl catheter into the RV, inserted through the right atrium across the tricuspid valve. It is used perioperatively to monitor RV pressure and typically is removed 48 hours later in the intensive care unit (see Special Features of Postoperative Care later). Measurements in the operating room after repair are not as informative and cannot serve as a guide to concomitant infundibular resection (see Results).

Transesophageal echocardiography should be used routinely to assess the outflow tract after separation from CPB, paying particular attention to gradients at the valvar and infundibular level, degree of pulmonary and tricuspid valve regurgitation, RV function, and presence and degree of intraatrial shunting.

## Transanular Patch

Although the likelihood of needing a transanular patch is greater when the RV cavity is small, the decision to place one at the initial surgical procedure is generally best made during operation.H2 When surgery is performed as a secondary procedure, the decision is usually made preoperatively. Operation proceeds as described earlier for open pulmonary valvotomy. The interior of the RV infundibulum is inspected by looking through the pulmonary valve orifice. If it appears to be narrowed and if the diameter of the opened pulmonary valve (and thus presumably the "anulus") has a *z* value of −3 or less (see discussion of *z* value in "Standardization of Dimensions" under Dimensions of Normal Cardiac and Great Artery Pathways in Chapter 1), and particularly when the RV cavity is very small, a transanular patch is probably indicated.

Incision in the pulmonary trunk is carried across the anulus and down to the junction of the sinus and infundibular portions of the RV. The pulmonary valve cusps are excised. Conservative resection of hypertrophied muscular trabeculae in the infundibulum may be accomplished, but this is often impractical in neonates (see Fig. 38-11 in Chapter 38). An enlarging patch is fashioned from glutaraldehyde-treated or untreated autologous pericardium and sewn into place with continuous 6-0 or 7-0 polypropylene sutures (see "Decision and Technique for Transanular Patching" in Section I of Chapter 38). Remainder of the procedure, including placing the polyvinyl catheter, is as described in the preceding text. A systemic–pulmonary artery shunt is added only if PaO2 is severely reduced after discontinuing CPB.

#### Systemic–Pulmonary Artery Shunt

If a systemic–pulmonary artery shunt is required as an isolated procedure (see Special Features of Postoperative Care later), a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) interposition aortopulmonary shunt is made using a 3.5- or 4-mm tube via a median sternotomy. Whether shunting is an isolated procedure or concomitant to valvotomy or transanular patching, the PTFE tube is placed between the brachiocephalic trunk–right subclavian artery junction and the right pulmonary artery (see Technique of Operation in Section I of Chapter 38).

## SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Proper perioperative management of neonates is essential for success. Generally these deeply cyanotic and critically ill infants are started on PGE1 intravenously in doses of 0.05 to 0.4 µg · kg<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> even before any studies are done; the resulting enlargement of the ductus arteriosus increases pulmonary blood flow and PaO2 by the time of operation.F6,N1,O3 PGE1 is continued during percutaneous valvotomy and early thereafter until the RV has a chance to remodel.

Caution must be used lest pulmonary overcirculation develop in a neonate whose pulmonary valve has been widely opened. The infant is left intubated and ventilated. As PGE1 is discontinued in the hours after the procedure, SaO2 is monitored by pulse oximeter, or PaO2 is measured frequently. If after 24 hours, PaO2 remains well above 30 mmHg and the hemodynamic state is good, the neonate is gradually weaned from the ventilator and extubated. Even though some arterial desaturation persists, so long as PaO2 stays above about 30 mmHg and the clinical condition remains good, the neonate is patiently followed in anticipation of continued improvement as the RV remodels and the pulmonary vascular resistance decreases. If PaO2 falls to 30 mmHg or less, and if residual stenosis is mild or absent, a PTFE systemic–pulmonary artery shunt is performed. If important RVOT obstruction is present along with important hypoxia, a transanular patch as well as a systemic–pulmonary artery shunt is probably necessary.

If a primary surgical procedure is performed on the RVOT, the ductus has typically been ligated, and an appropriately sized systemic–pulmonary artery shunt may also have been placed. When a systemic–pulmonary artery shunt has been performed, the infant should be restudied at about age 6 to 12 months; plans should then be made for shunt closure by percutaneous or surgical means. In some surgical patients who do not receive a shunt at the time of the initial RVOT procedure, persistent cyanosis will occur, requiring return to surgery for placement of a shunt. Patients should be followed after hospital discharge until there is assurance that the RV– pulmonary artery peak pressure gradient is within acceptable limits. If it is not but can be remedied by further valvotomy, percutaneous techniques are generally recommended. In about 10% of patients, follow-up evaluation indicates important residual RV hypertension from "anular" or persistent infundibular narrowing; placing a transanular patch is then required to achieve the desired result.

#### RESULTS

## Survival

#### *Early (Hospital) Death*

About 10% of heterogeneous groups of neonates die during initial hospitalization (Fig. 39-7). Risk-adjusted analysis indicates that early death occurs in only 6% of neonates treated by the surgical methods described in this chapter (Fig. 39-8). This very good result in critically ill patients is directly traceable to introduction of PGE1, general improvement in neonatal cardiac surgery, and advent of percutaneous balloon valvotomy.H2 Results of balloon valvotomy in neonates compare favorably with those of surgical valvotomy. Tabatabaei and colleagues were able to accomplish balloon dilatation in 35 of 37 neonates with critical valvar pulmonary stenosis (generally with suprasystemic RV pressure),T1 with only 3 deaths (8%; CL 0%-16%). Others have reported similarly good survival.F4,F5,T2,Z1

#### *Time-Related Survival*

Survival for at least 4 years after birth in heterogeneous groups of treated neonates is about 80% (see Fig. 39-7). The rapidly declining appreciable early rate of death (hazard function) begins to flatten out considerably about 3 months after intervention. Risk-adjusted survival for at least 4 years can be presumed to be 94% (see Fig. 39-8), because death rarely occurred between 6 months and 4 years postoperatively in a large study.H2 Gudausky and Beekman have reviewed midand long-term outcomes following balloon valvotomy in neonates, citing 6 studies since 1995 in addition to their own experience, totaling 221 patients.G12 There were a total of 249 patients, with successful dilatation in 224 (90%). Follow-up ranged from 1 to 116 months. Twelve serious

complications resulted from the procedure, and 13 total deaths; 5 of the deaths were early and 8 were late.

#### Modes of Death

The mode of virtually all deaths is either hypoxia or acute cardiac failure.

#### Incremental Risk Factors for Premature Death

Although uncommon, RV enlargement of an appreciable degree is a highly lethal coexisting cardiac anomaly. This is probably a special situation in which there is a coexisting cardiomyopathy or tricuspid valve lesion (e.g., Ebstein malformation) already present in fetal life because of genetic or developmental factors. Aside from these rare cases, no general patient-specific risk factors for death are identifiable in neonates. This is unusual in patients with congenital heart disease.

For open pulmonary valvotomy *without* inflow stasis or CPB and for certain morphologic variants (see text that follows), transanular patching without a shunt is a risk factor, and these procedures should not be used<sup>H2</sup> (Table 39-2).

Analysis was of 93 patients, excluding five with Ebstein anomaly, a large right ventricle, or both, and three (two are deceased) in which no procedure was performed.

<sup>b</sup>The three factors listed under transanular patching without a shunt are interaction terms; that is, they pertain only to patients in whom transanular patching without a shunt was performed, not to patients undergoing other types of procedure. Transanular patching without a shunt, when examined without interaction terms, had a low P value of .9.

Key: *PT*, Pulmonary trunk; *RV*, right ventricle.

Other procedures give good results, with few differences between them (Fig. 39-9). In neonates and young infants, transanular patching unaccompanied by a systemic–pulmonary artery shunt is an incremental risk factor when the pulmonary "anulus" is severely hypoplastic or when there is important tricuspid regurgitation. Patients in this situation usually have severe RV hypertrophy and reduced cavity size; without a shunt, they tend to have marked hypoxia from right-to-left shunting across a patent foramen ovale secondary to acute RV failure.

![](_page_8_Figure_2.jpeg)

Figure 39-9 Risk-adjusted predicted percent survival for at least 6 months after first intervention in neonates with critical pulmonary stenosis. Depiction is similar to that in Figure 39-8. It indicates that in 1991 (value entered for date of operation), all procedures other than open pulmonary valvotomy without inflow stasis or cardiopulmonary bypass were followed by a 94% probability of survival for at least 6 months when the z value of right ventricle (RV)–pulmonary trunk (PT) junction ("anulus") was –4 or larger. When the anulus was severely hypoplastic, survival was not as good as after a transanular patch (TAP) without a shunt (see text). (Data from Hanley and colleagues. H2)

#### Reintervention

About 75% of neonates successfully undergoing pulmonary valvotomy require no further procedure for at least 4 years. H2 About 10% remain hypoxic and require a systemic–pulmonary artery shunt. In a few, repeat balloon valvotomy is needed. About 10% of those not initially receiving a transanular patch will need one at some point. Rarely (<2%), a two-ventricle system cannot be attained, and a superior cavopulmonary anastomosis or Fontan-type operation is ultimately required. Similarly, Rao reports occurrence of reintervention was 25% following initial balloon valvotomy. R5

Occasionally, closure of an ASD is required as the RV remodels and important left-to-right shunting develops in patients in whom the ASD was purposefully left open at the time of the neonatal procedure. The long-term implications of severe pulmonary regurgitation, primarily in those patients who received a transanular patch, remain unclear. In patients who fail to develop adequate SaO<sub>2</sub> (>85% at rest) and right atrial pressure (<12-15 mmHg at rest) with the atrial septum and any systemic–pulmonary artery shunt temporarily closed, a superior cavopulmonary anastomosis can be considered to reduce the workload of the RV, allowing closure of the ASD and systemic–pulmonary shunt. Occasionally, a Fontan-type operation is ultimately indicated. G12

#### Residual Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction

Limited information is available concerning residual gradients. In about 90%, any important residual gradient has disappeared or been overcome by repeat percutaneous valvotomy within 6 to 12 months of the initial procedure. Ultimately, the RV–pulmonary trunk gradient is usually about 20 mmHg. M2,R1,R2,R6,R8,Z1 In unusual cases in which the gradient remains above about 50 mmHg, transanular

patching is warranted. The mechanism by which percutaneous balloon valvotomy effects its good results is generally the ideal one of commissural splitting; tearing of pulmonary valve tissue is uncommon. The exception may be the dysplastic pulmonary valve, in which commissural fusion is not the dominant problem causing obstruction. Although Stamm, Anderson, and colleagues emphasize that balloon valvotomy is ineffective, based on morphologic characteristics of dysplastic valves, reports vary as to effectiveness of this procedure in this setting. M1,M13,T5

## Morphologic and Functional Changes

Although some neonates initially have at least moderate reduction in RV cavity size, late after pulmonary valvotomy the RV cavity is normal or only mildly reduced in size in 90%. In only about 10% does an important degree of infundibular obstruction, cavity narrowing, or both persist. C2 Following balloon valvotomy, pulmonary anulus and RV chamber size increase, cusp mobility improves, and cusp thickening resolves in the majority of cases studied by echocardiography 6 months to 8 years after intervention. T1

Whereas most patients have tricuspid regurgitation initially (in some cases, severe), more than 80% have no regurgitation late after valvotomy. However, in a few patients, moderate or severe regurgitation persists, and it is likely that the tricuspid valve is somewhat dysplastic in these patients. Pulmonary regurgitation following balloon valvotomy occurs with increasing frequency and severity over time in 41% to 88% of patients. B3,G4 Need for surgical placement of a competent pulmonary valve prosthesis is unusual but reported. B3

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Interventional treatment is indicated for all neonates. It may be accomplished by percutaneous balloon valvotomy or by open surgical valvotomy with CPB. Balloon valvotomy is the procedure of choice in most circumstances. An exception is when the patient has severe hypoplasia (z value of –4 or less) of the pulmonary "anulus" and severe reduction of RV cavity size; inserting a transanular patch and concomitantly constructing a systemic–pulmonary artery shunt are indicated as the initial procedure. When only a valvotomy has been performed, a subsequent systemic–pulmonary artery shunt, transanular patch, or both will be indicated in 10% to 20% of patients (see Special Features of Postoperative Care earlier). Surgical valvotomy is also the procedure of choice if expertise in percutaneous balloon valvotomy is lacking.

# Section II Pulmonary Stenosis in Infants, Children, and Adults

#### **MORPHOLOGY**

Valvar pulmonary stenosis and intact ventricular septum in patients presenting after the neonatal period is a spectrum ranging from critical (pinhole) pulmonary stenosis, through severe pulmonary stenosis with a normal-sized or dilated RV, to moderate or mild valvar pulmonary stenosis that remains relatively stable throughout life.

Key: *PA,* Pulmonary artery; *PT,* pulmonary trunk.

#### Pulmonary Valve

The pulmonary valve is usually better developed in infants and children with severe pulmonary stenosis than it is in neonates. Although the cusp tissue may have a myxomatous appearance and may be irregularly deformed and thickened, the two, three, or even four pulmonary valve cusps are relatively well formed with only partial commissural fusion.G10,S3 In adults, the valve may become calcified, particularly when there has been preexisting infective endocarditis.D5 In older patients, a variable amount of infundibular hypertrophy results in secondary infundibular stenosis. Occasionally, infundibular stenosis alone accounts for RV outflow tract obstruction (Table 39-3).

## Pulmonary Arteries

Post-stenotic dilatation of the pulmonary trunk (see Fig. 39-5) is characteristic of this malformation and is present in about 70% of infants and children with this lesion.F1,G6 The left pulmonary artery may be involved as well.

## Right Ventricle

In older patients, in contrast to neonates, important hypoplasia of the RV is uncommon, although marked thickening of the ventricular wall is often seen. When this thickening involves the infundibular septum and free wall of the RV, severe subvalvar obstruction gradually develops.K5 This has been anecdotally referred to as the "suicidal tendency" of the RV of patients with important pulmonary stenosis. In occasional cases, a low-lying and large moderator band or so-called anomalous muscle bands contribute to infundibular obstruction. In about 10% to 20% of patients, these are the only sites of obstruction, the valve being either normal or (rarely) bicuspid, but not stenotic (see Section V of Chapter 38).

#### Tricuspid Valve

In infants and children, the tricuspid valve is usually morphologically normal. However, mild regurgitation or, in the face of RV failure, moderate or severe regurgitation may develop.

#### Right Atrium

The right atrial wall is hypertrophied secondary to increased right atrial pressure. In about one fourth of infants and adults, the atrial septum is intact. However, in most the foramen ovale is patent, or there is a small ostium secundum ASD; right-to-left shunting results in cyanosis.F2,K5 When a left-toright shunt is present, there is usually a large ASD and only mild or moderate pulmonary stenosis.R7

#### Left Ventricle

Alterations in the LV (e.g., myocardial infarction, myocardial dysplasia, obstructive changes in the coronary arteries, abnormal media of the ascending aorta) have been shown occasionally to coexist with pulmonary stenosis and intact ventricular septum.B2,S6 Muscular subaortic stenosis of the variety seen in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy may coexist. A combination of muscular subaortic and subpulmonary obstruction may be associated with abnormal facies and is a possible variant of Noonan syndrome.N2 Important valvar pulmonary stenosis in infants and children can adversely affect LV function.H3 This is largely the result of RV hypertension that displaces the septum toward the left and alters LV geometry.S4 Cardiac output and LV function are adversely affected, but the abnormalities revert to normal after correction of the RV outflow obstruction.

#### Associated Anomalies

Pulmonary stenosis and intact ventricular septum occurs frequently in Noonan syndrome, which is characterized by small stature, hypertelorism, mild mental retardation, cardiac malformations (most commonly pulmonary stenosis), and at times ptosis, undescended testes, and skeletal malformations.L5,N2 It is also associated with intrauterine rubella.

## CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

#### Symptoms

Infants may be symptomatic but usually have less severe symptoms than neonates. After the first year, patients often present because of a murmur only, produced by mild or moderate stenosis. In the second, third, and fourth decades, presentation may be with chronic RV failure. In all, 30% to 40% of patients are asymptomatic when first examined.F1,K3 When symptoms occur, the earliest is often effort dyspnea, which results from inability to increase pulmonary (and thus systemic) blood flow with exercise because of the relatively fixed resistance of the pulmonary valve.A3,F1

Cyanosis appears when, in the presence of an interatrial communication, the RV becomes less compliant than the LV or its pressure becomes severely elevated. With a normally developed RV, this occurs only when its pressure is suprasystemic, and is associated with ECG evidence of considerable RV hypertrophy. When cyanosis is marked in older patients, polycythemia becomes severe, and all the complications associated with this condition can develop (see "Clinical Presentation" under Clinical Features and Diagnostic Criteria in Section I of Chapter 38).M11 However, these patients rarely squat for symptomatic relief as do those with tetralogy of Fallot.A3,F1

This group is discussed in more detail in Section V of Chapter 38. Includes only patients receiving combined valvotomy and infundibular resection.

Effort-related precordial pain is not uncommon and is presumably due to RV angina. Sudden death can occur in cyanotic and acyanotic children and in young adults.M11,W3

Patients in the second and third decades of life with severe and long-neglected pulmonary stenosis and intact ventricular septum show development of right heart failure with elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatomegaly, and ascites, which eventually leads to death.

#### Signs

Except in young infants with severe heart failure, a systolic murmur (best heard in the second left interspace) is present, often with a thrill. Peak intensity of the murmur occurs later in systole in those with severe rather than mild stenosis.G2 The pulmonary component of the second sound may be normal, decreased, or inaudible, whereas the aortic component is usually obscured by the murmur. The tighter the pulmonary stenosis, the longer the RV ejection time and the greater the delay in pulmonary valve closure.G2,V1

In severe stenosis, an ejection click is absent because the dome of the pulmonary valve is pushed upward into the pulmonary trunk by the vigorous right atrial contraction before ventricular systole occurs. In some patients with mild stenosis, the abnormality of cusp movement may be insufficient to produce a click, although in other patients it may be prominent, the sound being magnified by a dilated pulmonary trunk.

The hypertrophied RV can often be appreciated as an RV heave palpable to the left of the sternum. The jugular venous "a" wave increases in amplitude as pulmonary stenosis increases in severity and is made more obvious by a noncompliant RV.W3 In older children, diagnosis of associated RV hypoplasia is suspected when signs of pulmonary stenosis are combined with heart failure and cyanosis in the absence of severe RV hypertrophy on the ECG. Thus, in contrast to pulmonary stenosis with a normally developed RV, cyanosis may occur when its pressure is less than systemic and the ECG is unremarkable.S1,W2

## Electrocardiography

Right atrial enlargement from moderate or severe pulmonary stenosis is reflected in prominent P waves in the ECG.S5 When pulmonary stenosis is mild or moderate, the R-wave height in V1 is less than 10 mm, or there is a pattern of incomplete right bundle branch block. When it is severe, the R or R′ in V1 becomes greater than 10 mm and corresponding in its height to degree of RV hypertension.E3

#### Echocardiography

In children and adults, as well as neonates, two-dimensional echocardiography can provide near-certain diagnosis. The thickened, immobile, or domed pulmonary valve can be imaged, along with post-stenotic enlargement of the pulmonary trunk and RV thickening. Severity of stenosis can be estimated by Doppler evaluation of the flow across the pulmonary valve in systole, and this can be confirmed by similar evaluation of the velocity of flow in the tricuspid valve regurgitant jet, if present. Echocardiography can also be used to diagnose restrictive RV physiology by demonstrating forward flow across the pulmonary valve in late diastole. This physiology can be present in up to 42% of adults with moderate or severe stenosis and correlates with increased symptoms.L2

## Cardiac Catheterization and Cineangiography

Techniques and findings are the same as those described in Section I.

## NATURAL HISTORY

Pulmonary stenosis with intact ventricular septum accounts for about 10% of congenital heart disease and is thus a common malformation. Most surgical series show a predominance of females.

## Patients Presenting in Infancy

Patients who survive the neonatal period to present later in infancy have a wide variation in degree of pulmonary valve narrowing. About 40% (CL 32%-47%) have mild obstruction, 47% (CL 39%-54%) moderate, and only 14% (CL 9%-20%) severe. However, these percentages probably underestimate the proportion of patients in this age group with severe obstruction. Nugent and colleagues found that 58% (CL 51%-64%) of an unselected group of infants presenting in the first 2 years (*n* = 81) with this entity had severe RV outflow obstruction.N3 Even in early life, and probably more so as time passes, infundibular (muscular) narrowing adds to RV output resistance.

When RV outflow obstruction is severe in infants and young children, heart failure, cyanosis, or both are common (more so than in older patients who have developed the same degree of obstruction).L4,N3 Prognosis of this group is poor. Levine and Blumenthal found that 56% of patients with heart failure died during follow-up.L4

Even when obstruction is moderate in this young age group, an important proportion have heart failure, with its same poor prognostic implication. It is probable that a degree of RV hypoplasia is often implicated in heart failure under these circumstances. According to Mody's study of 17 patients with moderate RV outflow tract obstruction in the first year, 53% (CL 38%-68%) experienced progression to a severe lesion in the next several years (average 4.5 years).M8 Similar conclusions can be drawn from the data of Wennevold and Jacobsen and Danilowicz and colleagues.D2,W1

Even in asymptomatic infants with mild stenosis, Anand and Mehta reported rapid progression requiring intervention within 6 months in 15%.A2 Experience of others, however, contradicts this, indicating that progression of mild pulmonary stenosis (gradient of <40 mmHg) in infants is rare and is similar to the natural history of mild pulmonary stenosis diagnosed in older children.A4,D6

#### Patients Presenting after Infancy

Patients with isolated pulmonary stenosis that produces mild RV outflow obstruction (peak pressure gradient between RV and pulmonary trunk ≤ 25 mmHg or RV peak pressure ≤ 50 mmHg) have a predicted probability of survival equal to that of an age-gender-ethnicity–matched general population.H4 These patients rarely experience progression of pulmonary stenosis and therefore rarely require interventional therapy.H4,M8,M9,M10 Recent studies by Rowland and colleagues and Gielen and colleagues corroborate earlier findings.G7,R12

Patients with moderately severe obstruction (peak pressure gradient between RV and pulmonary trunk > 25 mmHg but < 50 mmHg, or RV peak pressure > 50 mmHg but < 80 mmHg) sometimes experience progression in severity of their RV outflow obstruction. Without progression, as best as can be gleaned from currently available information, predicted probability of survival for at least 25 years is excellent.H4

Patients with severe pulmonary stenosis are susceptible to eventual development of chronic heart failure (and thus premature death), the tendency being greater the older the patient. Secondary changes in the severely stenotic valve probably make it more obstructive as time passes, with the outflow tract becoming more hypertrophied and stenotic and the RV becoming thicker, more fibrotic, less contractile, and less compliant.H1 In women with severe pulmonary stenosis who are in New York Heart Association functional class I or II, pregnancy is not associated with an increase in fetal or maternal complications, in contrast to similar disease of the mitral or aortic valve.

## Effect of Right Ventricular Hypoplasia

RV hypoplasia seems to affect natural history unfavorably. However, some patients with hypoplasia do not die in infancy but present later in life, usually with progressive cyanosis from a right-to-left shunt at atrial level. Left untreated, progressive right heart failure develops and causes death.

## TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

## Comment

In infants, children, and adults, as in neonates, percutaneous balloon valvotomy is the treatment of choice for valvar pulmonary stenosis. If this is not successful, or is not indicated, open surgical valvotomy using CPB is performed. Balloon valvotomy is ineffective in most cases of dysplastic pulmonary valve, and when the valve anulus is hypoplastic (*z* value < −3). The surgical technique is that described in Section I. When transanular patching is necessary, the technique is also that described in Section I.

#### Open Operation during Cardiopulmonary Bypass

The general aspects of operation described in Section I are applicable to pulmonary valvotomy in infants and adults. After the pulmonary trunk is opened through a vertical incision, valvotomy is performed (Fig. 39-10). When edges of the cusps are bulky and obstructive, and particularly when the valve is bicuspid, partial or complete valvectomy may be necessary, because a taut bicuspid valve cannot open properly even after incision of the two fused commissures. RV, LV, and pulmonary artery pressures are measured at this point, but they are of little value in decision making (see Special Features of Postoperative Care later). A polyvinyl catheter is placed to measure RV pressure. It can be brought from the pulmonary artery out the low RV or alternatively, can be advanced forward from the right atrium through the tricuspid valve. Pressure measurements made the following morning may indicate the need for return to the operating room for relief of infundibular or anular stenosis.

When an infundibular resection is indicated (Fig. 39-11), a vertical infundibular incision is preferred. After resection, the incision is closed using an oval-shaped patch of PTFE or pericardium. In a few patients, a transanular patch is required because of a small pulmonary valve anulus. Patients requiring this often have dysplastic pulmonary valves. Cineangiogram or echocardiogram may suggest need for the transanular patch, but the final decision is usually made in the operating room. At the time of valvotomy through the pulmonary arteriotomy, the anulus is sized with Hegar dilators. If it is small (*z* value of −3 or less), the arteriotomy is carried across the anulus and down the infundibular free wall. If there is doubt about need for transanular patching, the pulmonary arteriotomy is left open and a vertical incision made in the infundibulum.

After muscle resection has been accomplished, the anulus is again sized by Hegar dilators passed through the valve from below. If it is too small, the two incisions are joined by cutting across the anulus, and a transanular patch is inserted (see "Decision and Technique for Transanular Patching" under Technique of Operation in Section I of Chapter 38). Deleon and colleagues have described a reconstructive operation for patients with dysplastic pulmonary valve with hypoplastic anulus that preserves valve function.D4 However, the experience involves only two patients, and follow-up is limited.D4

In the occasional patient with stenosis of the pulmonary trunk or branches in whom these have not, or cannot, be treated adequately by balloon dilatation and stenting, the narrowed pulmonary branch is dissected to a point beyond the stenosis and an enlarging repair made (see Technique of Operation in Section I of Chapter 38). Preliminary dissection of these branches is best made during CPB cooling. These stenoses must be identified in detail at preoperative cardiac catheterization.

## SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Postoperative care is accomplished as described in Chapter 5. One special feature is that RV pressure should be assessed on the first postoperative day. This is accomplished by monitoring the RV pressure or withdrawal of the pulmonary artery pressure catheter that was placed at operation into the RV. These pressures are more reliable in predicting late results from operation than those taken in the operating room. However, if the patient's hemodynamic state is good, reoperation within a few days of the initial procedure is rarely necessary, even when RV pressure is high, because of the known tendency for infundibular hypertrophy to regress with time.

## RESULTS

#### Survival

#### *Early (Hospital) Death*

Hospital mortality is essentially zero after percutaneous balloon valvotomy.M1,M2,R1,R2 It is very low after surgical valvotomy as well and has been for many years.D1,E1,M3,P2,R11 It approaches zero when patients with severe RV hypoplasia or advanced chronic heart failure are excluded.

Young age (down to 1 month) is not a risk factor. The few deaths that occur are associated either with severe

As this is done, the surgeon and an assistant must carefully stabilize the cusp on either side to avoid inaccuracy in making the incision. If necessary, thickened valve tissue around the orifice may be resected, or a cusp may be partially detached. However, this is done only if the opening is otherwise unacceptable, because some degree of regurgitation results. When infundibular dissection and resection are also required, RV is opened through a vertical incision in the infundibulum. After performing the dissection and resection, vertical ventriculotomy is closed with a small oval patch of polytetrafluoroethylene or pericardium inserted with continuous polypropylene suture.

RV hypoplasia or, particularly in adults, advanced chronic heart failure.

## *Time-Related Survival*

Long-term survival is the rule after surgical treatment. In the early Mayo Clinic experience, survival out to 25 years after hospital discharge was 91% in the overall group, but this was importantly affected by age at operation.K6 Survival for at least 25 years after hospital discharge was 93% for those aged 0 to 4 years at operation, 100% for those aged 4 to 10 years at operation, 92% for those aged 11 to 20 years, and 71% for those older than 21 at operation.K6 Although neonates were not represented in this experience, infants were, and this probably accounts for the effect of age in that era.

In a more recent longitudinal study of 51 patients, with follow-up ranging from 22 to 33 years (mean 25 years), late survival was 96%.R11 Long-term survival is now available following balloon valvotomy. Fawzy and colleagues report 2- to 17-year follow-up (mean 10 years) in 90 patients, with no late deaths.F3 All patients were older at the time of balloon intervention in this study, ranging from 15 to 54 years. Gupta and colleagues reported a single death in 166 patients,G13 and Jarrar and colleagues report no late deaths in 62 patientsJ1 during follow-up.

#### Hemodynamic Outcomes and Reintervention

Immediate relief of the gradient usually is obtained, and it is rare for adequate initial relief of obstruction to be temporary. On average, a peak RV pressure of 128 mmHg before valvotomy is reduced to 51 mmHg shortly after valvotomy.K6 Completeness of relief of pulmonary stenosis can be determined only by late postoperative studies because of the usual, but not invariable, tendency for RV peak pressure to decrease over time after valvotomy.E2,G11 This decline is believed to be due primarily to regression of RV hypertrophy and lessening of infundibular narrowing.G9,K5,N3,R4 It is known, however, that adequate isolated pulmonary valvotomy does not invariably provide excellent relief of pulmonary stenosis, even in infants. Roos-Hesselink and colleagues report a low but definable incidence of restenosis.R11 In 64 patients with follow-up ranging from 22 to 33 years, the reintervention rate was 15%. Two patients required reoperation for recurrent RVOT obstruction at 2 and 3 years after initial surgery, and

Excision is often also necessary from the walls (anterior, medial, and lateral) for a short distance below ventriculotomy. *Continued*

two required subsequent balloon dilatation at 16 and 18 years postoperatively. Additionally, six other patients required surgical reintervention, ranging from 16 to 24 years postoperatively, for severe pulmonary regurgitation. Five of these six had a transanular patch placed at initial operation. Moderate to severe pulmonary regurgitation was present at late follow-up in 37% of patients.

Earing and colleagues, on the other hand, reported more concerning long-term reintervention.E1 In 53 patients with a mean follow-up of 33 years, reintervention for recurrent pulmonary stenosis was similarly low, but 21 patients (40%) required pulmonary valve replacement for severe regurgitation. This may reflect the extremely long follow-up, because other authors have recognized the progressive increase in symptomatic pulmonary regurgitation the longer the follow-up; however, equally important is that this cohort of patients underwent their original surgery in a different era. To this point, in this study, closed pulmonary valvotomy was importantly associated with need for late reoperation.

Hemodynamic results after percutaneous balloon valvotomy are similar to those just described (see Results in Section I). Fawzy and colleaguesF3 report a reduction in pulmonary valve gradient from 105 mmHg to 34 mmHg in their series of 90 patients (mean age 24 years). The infundibular gradient was large immediately following the procedure in 43 patients, all of whom underwent later recatheterization. The gradient decreased from 42 mmHg following the initial procedure to 13 mmHg at repeat study. Other reports document similar results.

Gudausky and BeekmanG12 summarize results from five large studies reported between 1994 and 2003. A total of 866 non-neonatal cases were included. Restenosis occurred in 20%, with 7% requiring repeat balloon valvotomy and 7% requiring surgery. Severe pulmonary insufficiency was present in 1%. Freedom from either surgical or balloon reintervention

at 5 and 10 years after intervention, reported by Rao and colleagues,R3 was 88% and 84%, respectively (Fig. 39-12).

#### Comparison of Surgery and Balloon Valvotomy

Peterson and colleagues studied comparative outcomes between surgical and balloon valvotomy.P2 Between 1969 and 2000, 62 patients underwent surgery, and 108 balloon valvotomy. Both techniques were effective, but there were differences at 10-year follow-up. Surgery reduced the gradient across the pulmonary valve more effectively than balloon valvotomy and had lower rates of restenosis and overall reintervention. Balloon valvotomy had a lower rate of moderate pulmonary regurgitation, which did not appear to influence reintervention rates in the two groups. Nevertheless, balloon valvotomy is today the procedure of choice because of its lower cost, shorter hospital stay, lower degree of invasiveness, and effectiveness. Based on the study of Earing and colleagues,E1 it can be inferred that the reintervention rate in the surgery group studied by Peterson and colleaguesP2 will continue to rise with longer follow-up as symptoms from pulmonary regurgitation develop.

#### Cyanosis

Cyanosis may persist late postoperatively when the foramen ovale or ASD is not closed, even when stenosis has been relieved, as a result of impaired RV compliance.D3,M5,O2 This can occur occasionally with a normally developed, severely hypertrophied RV, presumably secondary to diffuse fibrosis, but it is the rule in the hypoplastic RV. Data from Freed and colleagues suggest that the reversed atrial shunt may lessen as an infant or young child grows and as the RV increases in size, and later closure of the ASD thus may not be required.F3 This favorable sequence cannot be expected in patients with hypoplastic RV, and it is well known that important hypoxia can occur from a right-to-left shunt through a small atrial communication.

## Morphologic Changes

The sinus portion of the RV enlarges and becomes normal in size in most patients. The infundibulum enlarges in many patients, but as in tetralogy of Fallot (see Chapter 38), a narrow pulmonary anulus may fail to enlarge as the child grows. The apparent size of the pulmonary arteries increases, and in most patients they become normal sized. Tricuspid regurgitation, even when severe preoperatively, is usually absent or mild late postoperatively.

### Functional Capacity

Most patients have an excellent late functional result. Stone and colleagues have shown that during exercise, children who have undergone pulmonary valvotomy have a normal relationship between cardiac output and oxygen consumption, no increase in RV end-diastolic pressure (preoperatively it increased), and less increase than preoperatively in RV peak systolic pressure.S9

The late result in patients with a hypoplastic RV is inferior to that in patients with a normally developed ventricle. Late mortality is higher, there may be a reversed shunt through an unclosed atrial communication, and there may be residual infundibular obstruction. There may also be persistent or recurrent right heart failure despite complete relief of stenosis. Although there are no techniques proven to be beneficial in managing the hypoplastic RV, a number of options are available in selected cases. Late heart failure may be prevented in this group, particularly in those who are young, by a complete valvotomy combined with enlargement of the RV cavity by excision of trabeculations. This may be particularly helpful if extensive endocardial fibrosis is present. In patients with persistent RV failure, volume unloading by creating a bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis may be beneficial.

## INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

When patients first show signs and symptoms at age 1 month or more, they are usually less critically ill than those presenting as neonates. Nonetheless, when diagnosis of severe stenosis is made, pulmonary valvotomy is advisable. As in critical pulmonary stenosis in neonates, percutaneous balloon valvotomy is usually the intervention indicated.F4,O1,T1 Only in special circumstances is surgical intervention indicated. These include dysplastic valves, severely hypoplastic valves, severe infundibular stenosis, and associated intracardiac lesions requiring surgery.

Intervention is similarly advised in asymptomatic infants with severe stenosis. In those with moderate stenosis, intervention in infancy is debatable; it is not recommended when stenosis is mild. In older patients, management differs only in the group with moderate stenosis. In this subset, the older the age at diagnosis, the less likely there will be important progression and therefore less need for intervention.

In all patient groups beyond the neonatal period, a gradient across the pulmonary valve of 50 mmHg or greater is considered an indication for intervention. Presence and degree of RV hypoplasia are taken into account when deciding on intervention. Because of its effect in increasing cyanosis and heart failure, severe RV hypoplasia makes intervention more urgent in infants. In older children and adults presenting with this lesion, indications for intervention do not differ unless there is severe heart failure unresponsive to medical measures. Under these circumstances, risk of intervention is increased.

### SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

## Right Ventricular Hypoplasia in Children and Adults

When the RV is severely hypoplastic, symptoms and signs are substantially altered. Important symptoms are not necessarily present in infancy, but when they appear they tend to progress rapidly. Classically, there is a markedly prominent *a* wave and reversed (expiratory) splitting of the second heart sound.W2 Pulmonary stenosis with hypoplastic RV is associated with less than the expected degree of RV hypertrophy, and in severe hypoplasia, LV forces are dominant despite severe stenosis.E3 Diminished RV potentials are due to smallness of its cavity rather than to diminution in muscle mass.B6 Balloon valvotomy may not be as effective in this group because of (1) frequent presence of organic infundibular obstruction, (2) necessity of closing the atrial communication to abolish the otherwise persistent right-to-left shunt, and (3) probable benefits of enlarging the RV cavity by excising muscle from its sinus portion.W2 Taking all these factors into consideration, a surgical approach may be required. However, when severe heart failure is present, prognosis is still poor with any approach. In this setting, reducing volume load on the RV by performing a superior cavopulmonary anastomosis may be of benefit (see Special Situations and Controversies in Section III of Chapter 41).

#### Supravalvar Pulmonary Stenosis

The rarest form of pulmonary stenosis and intact ventricular septum is supravalvar pulmonary stenosis. It has been called *hourglass pulmonary stenosis* M4 and is characterized by narrowing of the sinutubular junction, similar to that seen in supravalvar aortic stenosis. This lesion, like pulmonary valve dysplasia, does not respond to balloon dilatationB1; surgery is required. Various technical approaches have been described, all similar to those described for supravalvar aortic stenosis (see Section III of Chapter 47). The technique of repair can involve patching from the main pulmonary artery across the sinutubular junction into the sinus of Valsalva. Alternatively, repair using only native pulmonary artery tissue has been described.B1
