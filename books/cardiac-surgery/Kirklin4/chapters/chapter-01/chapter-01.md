This chapter describes normal cardiac and great artery anatomy and dimensions, as well as the terminology usually employed.

#### CARDIAC CHAMBERS AND MAJOR VESSELS

Accurate diagnosis of congenital heart defects depends in part on identifying cardiac chambers and major vessels by their morphology, regardless of their spatial positions (Fig. 1-1).

#### Right Atrium

The right atrium (Fig. 1-2) is the heart chamber that normally receives systemic venous drainage from inferior and superior venae cavae. It also normally receives the major portion of coronary venous drainage from the coronary sinus. Morphologic characteristics important for identifying the right atrium are presence of the limbus of the fossa ovalis, which surrounds the valve of the fossa ovalis (septum primum) superiorly, anteriorly, and posteriorly; a wide-based, bluntended, right-sided atrial appendage (auricle); eustachian valve at the orifice of the inferior vena cava and thebesian valve at the orifice of the coronary sinus; and crista terminalis, which separates trabeculated from nontrabeculated (venous) portions of the atrium (Fig. 1-3).

The normal structures are sometimes expressed in an excessive or unusual manner. These are not themselves functionally important abnormalities but are usually associated with cardiac malformations. Thus, the eustachian and thebesian valves may be sufficiently prominent to appear to divide the right atrium into two parts, a common finding in tricuspid atresia.T6 The right atrial appendage may be juxtaposed leftward, and the left atrial appendage is less frequently juxtaposed rightward. Juxtaposition of the atrial appendages is usually associated with cardiac malformations.A17

Radiologically, the definitive morphologic features of the right atrium may be difficult to recognize.B11 Occasionally, the atrial septum is seen well enough in angiographic profile to delineate the limbus of the fossa ovalis, and sometimes the right atrial appendage is outlined sufficiently to differentiate its shape from that of the left atrial appendage. The fact that the hepatic portion of the inferior vena cava usually drains into the right atrium often makes it possible to determine the location of the right atrium by passage of a catheter from the inferior vena cava to the heart. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and three-dimensional (3D) echocardiographic computed tomography are increasingly able to identify even complex morphologic features of this and other cardiac chambers and their connections.H3,H6,K4,Y2

The atria are not in normal position in some patients; in these cases, the wide-based, blunt-ended right atrial appendage is the most secure indicator that an atrium is morphologically a right atrium. Other indicators of the morphology of the atria, and of atrial situs, include venous drainage and the situs indicated by the pulmonary artery and bronchial anatomy.P1,S23,V3,V4

#### Left Atrium

The left atrium (Fig. 1-4) is the cardiac chamber that normally receives pulmonary venous drainage from the four pulmonary veins. Its septal surface is characterized by the flap valve of the fossa ovalis (septum primum), in contrast to the limbus of the fossa ovalis present on the right atrioseptal surface. The left atrial appendage (auricle) is long and narrow, in contrast to bluntness of the right atrial appendage, and is the best indicator that the atrium is morphologically a left atrium. There is no crista terminalis at the base of the left atrial appendage, the only trabeculated structure in the left atrium.

In general, at cardiac catheterization, the location of the left atrium is determined by exclusion after identifying the position of the right atrium as described earlier. With normal pulmonary venous connection, the left atrium may

Its trabeculated portion is separated from its smooth portion by the crista terminalis. Fossa ovalis is located in center of atrial septum, surrounded on its superior, anterior, and posterior aspects by the limbus. Coronary sinus is positioned inferiorly. Coronary sinus, along with tendon of Todaro and anulus of septal leaflet of tricuspid valve, form the boundaries of triangle of Koch. Atrioventricular node and proximal portions of bundle of His, portions of the specialized conduction system, lie within the triangle of Koch. Right coronary artery lies in atrioventricular groove, the anatomic point of separation of right atrium and right ventricle.

be well opacified after a right ventricular or pulmonary artery injection.

#### Right Ventricle

Topographically, the right ventricle has a large sinus portion that surrounds and supports a tricuspid atrioventricular (AV) valve (inlet portion) and includes the apex and a smaller infundibulum (outlet portion) that supports a semilunar valve. The inlet and outlet valves of the right ventricle are thus widely separated. The entire sinus portion of the right ventricle and most of the infundibulum (both free wall and septum) are coarsely trabeculated.

The septal surface of the right ventricle is divided into an inlet portion, a trabecular portion (sometimes called the *apical trabecular portion*), and an outlet portionA9,S29 (Fig. 1-5). Alternatively, the septal surface of the right ventricle may be divided into posterior (basal), middle, apical (anterior), and infundibular (conal) portions (Fig. 1-6). The inlet portion of the ventricular septum surrounds and supports the tricuspid valve.1 The trabecular portion is that portion with the coarse trabecular pattern typical of the right ventricle (see Fig. 1-6). The outlet portion of the right ventricular aspect of the ventricular septum is smooth but complex and has three components. The largest is the infundibular (conal) septum, which separates the pulmonary from the aortic and tricuspid valves. Only part of the infundibular septum is interventricular (see Fig. 1-5), and in some malformations (e.g., double outlet right ventricle), none of it may be. It must be emphasized that the most distal cephalad portion of the infundibular septum is not, strictly speaking, part of the ventricular septum, because in the normal heart, the pulmonary valve arises from the apex of a cone of muscle and does not have a septal attachment.A9,B4,C5,V7 A second part of the outlet portion of the septum is the anterior (superior) extension, or division, of the trabecula septomarginalis (septal band). A third small, very anterior portion is a narrow extension superior to the trabecular septum.

Laterally to the right, the infundibular septum imperceptibly merges with the free right ventricular wall immediately beyond its attachment to the membranous septum; at that point, it can be called the *parietal extension of the infundibular septum*S22 (Fig. 1-7). The parietal band lies anterior to the right aortic sinus (see Fig. 1-7), partially overlying that portion of the free wall of the right ventricle termed the *ventriculoinfundibular fold*. Many surgeons call the infundibular septum and the parietal band the *crista superventricularis*. Medially and to the left, the infundibular septum merges with the trabecular portion of the septum between the limbs of the particularly prominent smooth, Y-shaped muscle bundle called the *trabecula septomarginalis* A10,T2 (Fig. 1-8). The trabecula septomarginalis extends apically to become continuous with the *moderator band,* a prominent trabeculation running from septum to free wall.

The phrase *inlet septum* is in some ways undesirable because the term has developmental implications,A7 and the large inlet septum on the right ventricular side is not duplicated on the left side. Use of the term *trabecular* to describe a portion of the sinus septum is also undesirable in some ways because part of the infundibular septum is also trabeculated (see Fig. 1-5).

**Figure 1-5** Interior of normal right ventricle, particularly trabecular and outlet portions, oriented as at operation. Infundibular (conal) septum separates pulmonary valve from tricuspid valve, and only its rightward portion and inferior part of its central portion form part of the interventricular septum (see also Fig. 1-6).

The junction between outlet and sinus (trabecular) portions of the right ventricle is clearly demarcated only along the lower margin of the outlet portion of the septum. The incomplete muscular ridge formed by the outlet septum (here, specifically, the infundibular septum) and the parietal band, together with the septal and moderator bands, forms a natural line of division between the posteroinferior sinus portion and the anterosuperior outlet portion of the ventricle.V2 It is in this area that ventricular septal defects (VSDs) most commonly occur; the morphology of the area gives the name "junctional," or "conoventricular," to these defects.

The papillary muscle arrangement supporting the three leaflets of the tricuspid valve is different from that of the mitral valve in the left ventricle. In the case of the tricuspid valve, in addition to a single large anterior papillary muscle attached to the anterior free wall that fuses with the moderator band, there are multiple smaller posterior papillary muscles attached partly to the posterior (inferior) free wall and partly to the septum, and a group of small septal papillary muscles. The lowermost of these small septal muscles attaches posterior to the trabecula septomarginalis (see Fig. 1-5) and the uppermost, called the *medial (conal) papillary muscle* (muscle of Lancisi or muscle of Luschka), to the posterior limb of the septal band (Fig. 1-9).

#### Left Ventricle

The left ventricle consists of a larger sinus portion, which supports a bicuspid AV valve and includes the apex, and a much smaller outlet (outflow) portion beneath a semilunar

**Figure 1-9** Interior of right ventricle, oriented as at operation. Right ventricle is divided into three portions: inlet, containing tricuspid valve and surrounding ventricular septum; sinus, or coarse trabecular portion; and outlet, or conus portion, containing infundibular septum and pulmonary valve. Right lateral extension of infundibular septum merges with right ventricle as ventriculoinfundibular fold (parietal band). Medially and to left, infundibular septum merges with right ventricle to form Y-shaped muscle bundle called *trabecula septomarginalis* (septal band). Trabecula septomarginalis extends to apex as the moderator band. An important landmark is the medial (conal) papillary muscle of the tricuspid valve.

valve. The inlet and outlet valves of the left ventricle lie juxtaposed within its base, and inflow and outflow portions are separated by the anterior mitral leaflet2 (Fig. 1-10).

The entire free wall of the left ventricle and apical half to two thirds of the septum are trabeculated (Fig. 1-11; see also Fig. 1-10), but the trabeculations are characteristically fine compared with those in the right ventricle.B11 The septal surface of the left ventricle may be considered to have a sinus portion, most of which is trabeculated, and a smooth outlet (outflow) portion (see Fig. 1-11). The part of the sinus portion of the septum immediately beneath the mitral valve may be termed the *inlet septum,* and the rest of the sinus portion, the *trabecular septum* (Fig. 1-12). The outlet (outflow) portion lies in front and to the right of the anterior mitral leaflet, corresponding to the inlet portion on the right ventricular side of the septum, and includes the AV septum (Fig. 1-13). In contrast to the right ventricular side, where the septal tricuspid leaflet is the only valvar attachment to the septum, on the left ventricular side, the rightward half of the anterior mitral valve leaflet attaches to the septum posteriorly, and the right and part of the noncoronary aortic cusps attach to it anteriorly (see Fig. 1-12). The leftward half of the anterior mitral leaflet is in fibrous continuity with the aortic valve in an area termed the *aortic–mitral anulus* (Fig. 1-14; see also Figs. 1-12 and 1-13). The anteriorly placed right ventricular infundibular (conal) septum lies opposite the aortic valve (Fig. 1-15). It may occasionally be displaced into the left ventricular outflow beneath the aortic valve; occasionally, muscle may also extend between the aortic and mitral valves, forming a true infundibulum to the left ventricle (see Fig. 1-10). The papillary muscles are called *anterolateral* (or simply *anterior*) and *posteromedial (posterior).* No papillary muscles attach to the left side of the ventricular septum.

#### Myoarchitecture of the Ventricles

The adult ventricular mass is made up of a three-dimensional network of myocardial cells.S3 This network is highly structured and arranged in layers in which the myocardial cells have a preferred orientation. In all hearts, the ventricular wall is arranged in three layers: superficial (subepicardial), middle, and deep (subendocardial). Superficial and deep layers are present in both right and left ventricles, whereas the middle layer is only present in the left ventricle. The superficial and deep layers are anchored at the ventricular orifices to fibrous structures of the central fibrous skeleton of the heart. This

In this text, cusps of atrioventricular valves are termed *leaflets,* although current anatomy texts use the term *cusp* for both semilunar and atrioventricular valves.

suggests that myocardial contraction plays an active role in cardiac valve function. The middle layer, unique to the left ventricle, shows a circumferential pattern. No planes of fibrous septation are present between the three layers. Instead, the distinction between one layer and the next is made by a change in muscle fiber direction. This is particularly evident in the ventricular septum, where the superficial layer of the right ventricle invaginates at the interventricular sulcus to form a thin muscular layer that forms the right side of the ventricular septum, covering the circumferentially arranged muscle fibers of the middle layer of the left ventricle. There are age-related changes in direction of the muscle fibers in the superficial layer. With advancing fetal and infant age, muscle fiber arrangement progresses from a horizontal to an oblique orientation.S2 This change is especially evident in the right ventricle and probably reflects the changing pressure gradient between right and left ventricles.

The anatomy of the muscular subpulmonary infundibulum was studied by Merrick and colleagues.M5 They point out a freestanding sleeve of myocardium supporting the pulmonary valve that is separate from the underlying anatomic ventricular septum, and Van Praagh argues that this subsemilunar infundibulum "belongs" to the great arteries, not the ventricles.V7 It may be identified by changing directions of myocardial muscle fibers, referred to by surgeons as "layers" of the septum. This anatomic feature makes possible the safe separation of the pulmonary trunk from the right ventricular outflow tract for use as a valve substitute (autograft).

#### Great Arteries

The *aorta* is the great artery arising from the base of the heart that normally gives rise to the systemic and coronary arteries. Identity of the aorta is established by recognizing it as the vessel of origin of the brachiocephalic arteries, which never arise from the pulmonary artery. It is not so definitively the vessel of origin of the coronary arteries; occasionally one, or rarely both, coronary arteries may arise from the pulmonary arteryO1 (Appendix 1A).

The *pulmonary trunk* (main pulmonary artery) is the great artery that normally gives rise to the pulmonary arterial system. The pulmonary trunk characteristically has no brachiocephalic vessels arising from it. At angiography, differentiation between pulmonary trunk and aorta may require careful study, as the brachiocephalic vessels may opacify with the pulmonary trunk by filling through a patent ductus arteriosus. The pulmonary valve is normally anterior, and the aortic valve posterior and to the right, in individuals with visceral and atrial situs solitus.

#### ATRIAL SEPTUM

See "Right Atrium" and "Left Atrium."

#### VENTRICULAR SEPTUM

The right and left ventricular septal surfaces are asymmetric, related mainly to presence of an infundibulum in the right ventricle only (although Van Praagh and colleagues argue that a small portion of the subsemilunar conus lies just beneath the right aortic valve cuspV9 [see Appendix 1A]). In addition, higher pressure in the left ventricle makes the sinus septal surface concave on the left side and convex on

the right (see Fig. 1-15), a feature accentuated during ventricular systole. The axes of the right and left ventricular outflow tracts differ. That of the right ventricle is almost vertically oriented, whereas that of the left ventricle angles sharply to the right (Fig. 1-16), a feature profiled cineangiographically in the left anterior oblique (LAO) view and in the parasternal long axis view by two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography.B2,B11

#### Muscular Septum

See "Right Ventricle" and "Left Ventricle."

#### Membranous Septum

The membranous septum (pars membranacea) is the fibrous part of the cardiac septum separating the left ventricular outflow tract from, in part, the right ventricle and, in part, the right atrium. The line of division between these components is determined by attachment of the tricuspid valve anulus to the septum (see Fig. 1-12). On the right ventricular side of this attachment is the interventricular component. On the right atrial side, it forms the membranous portion of the AV septum.

#### Atrioventricular Septum

The AV septum is the portion of the cardiac septum that lies between the right atrium and left ventricle. It consists of a superior membranous portion and an inferior muscular portion. The AV septum is apparent because the septal attachment of the tricuspid valve is more apical than the septal

![](_page_11_Picture_2.jpeg)

attachment of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve (Fig. 1-17). Viewed from the left ventricular side, the muscular component forms part of the outlet septum (see Fig. 1-13). The AV node lies in the atrial septum adjacent to the junction between membranous and muscular portions of the AV septum, and the bundle of His passes toward the right trigone between these two components (Fig. 1-18).

#### CONDUCTION SYSTEM

The following description is based on studies of hearts *without* congenital defects.B7 Abnormalities of the conduction system are associated with certain congenital cardiac malformations and determined primarily by the alignment between atrial and ventricular septal structures and the pattern of ventricular architectureA13,A14 (see Chapters 55 and 56).

#### Sinus Node

The sinus (sinoatrial) node is located along the anterolateral aspect of the junction between the superior vena cava and the right atrial appendageH8,J1,L4,T5 (Fig. 1-19). In rare cases, it extends medially across the crest of the caval–atrial junction. The node is superficial, lying just beneath the epicardial surface in the sulcus terminalis, and is approximately 15 × 5 × 1.5 mm.J1 It is pierced by the relatively large sinus node artery. (For details of the blood supply, see "Coronary Arteries".)

#### Internodal Pathways

The spread of activation between sinus node and AV node occurs preferentially through the muscle bundles delimited by orifices of the right atriumS27,S28 (see Fig. 1-19). Considerable histologic and electrophysiologic investigation has been carried out to determine whether pathways of specialized conduction tissue exist within these broad muscle bundles and connect the sinoatrial (SA) and AV nodes. Investigators have not found discrete internodal tracts composed of homogeneous cells or fibers, although some have identified Purkinje-like cells in the major muscle bundles of adult hearts.J4,J7,L5,T7 Controversy continues as to whether these pale cells seen in the atrial myocardium are Purkinje-type cells and whether they form preferential conduction pathways.

#### Atrioventricular Node

The AV node lies directly on the right atrial side of the central fibrous body (right trigone) in the muscular portion of the AV septum, just anterosuperior to the ostium of the coronary sinus.J3,T5 At times, its posterior margin has been found to lie directly against the coronary sinus ostium.J3 It has a flattened oblong shape and an average dimension in adults of 1 × 3 × 6 mm. Its left surface lies against the mitral anulus. Viewed from the right atrium, the AV node can be localized within a triangle—described by Koch (Fig. 1-20)—formed by the tricuspid anulus, tendon of Todaro (continuation of the

**Figure 1-18** Diagram of right heart, aortic root, and conduction tissue at approximately 65-degree right anterior oblique projection.

Muscular portion of atrioventricular septum is frequently smaller than depicted.

eustachian valve that runs to the central fibrous body), and coronary sinus ostium. The opening of the coronary sinus is usually a good landmark for the nodal triangle,S7 but in hearts with an abnormal coronary sinus orifice, the nodal triangle is variable in relation to the coronary sinus. Examples of variability are when the coronary sinus opens to the left of the ventricular septum, when there is malalignment between atrial and ventricular septal structures, and when the atrial septum is absent.

#### Bundle of His and Bundle Branches

The common AV bundle (bundle of His) is a direct continuation of the AV node. The bundle passes through the rightward part of the right trigone of the central fibrous body to reach the posteroinferior margin of the membranous ventricular septum. This area is just inferior to the commissure between the tricuspid valve's septal and anterior leaflets (see Fig. 1-19, *B*). Its diameter in the region of the central fibrous body is about 1 mm.J3 The bundle courses along the posteroinferior border of the membranous septum and crest of the muscular ventricular septum, giving off fibers that form the left bundle branch. This branching occurs beneath the commissure between the right and noncoronary cusps in close proximity to the aortic valve, over a distance of 6.5 to 20 mm, after which the remaining fibers form the right bundle branch (Fig. 1-21). The bundle of His lies on the left side of the ventricular septal crest in about 75% to 80% of human hearts and on the right side of the crest in the remainder.M2 In the latter situation, the His bundle connects to the left bundle by a relatively narrow stem.M1

The left bundle branch fans out over the left ventricular septal surface, gradually forming two or three main radiations.D6,S26,T5 It is not uncommon for the anterior and posterior subdivisions to be accompanied by a central, third radiation that originates from the His bundle or from both of the former subdivisions. The anterior radiation travels toward the base of the anterolateral papillary muscle of the left ventricle. The wider posterior subdivision courses toward the base of the posteromedial papillary muscle. Multiple peripheral anastomoses occur among the subdivisions of the left bundle branch system as it distributes to the left ventricle.D6

The right bundle branch originates from the bundle of His in the region of the anteroinferior margin of the membranous septum and courses along the right ventricular septal surface, passing just below the medial papillary muscle and along the inferior margin of the septal band and the moderator band to the base of the anterior papillary muscle.L5 The fibers then fan out to supply the walls of the right ventricle. Proximally, the right bundle averages about 1 mm in diameter.T5 It is usually subendocardial in its proximal portion, intramyocardial in its middle portion, and again subendocardial near the base of the anterior papillary muscle.T5 VSDs associated with malalignment of portions of the ventricular septum affect these relationships to some extent.T1

#### CARDIAC VALVES

The interrelationships among the heart valves in normally formed hearts are remarkably uniform.M4 The aortic valve occupies a central position, wedged between the mitral and tricuspid valves, whereas the pulmonary valve is situated anterior, superior, and slightly to the left of the aortic valve (Fig. 1-22). The anuli of the mitral and tricuspid valves merge with each other and with the membranous septum to form the fibrous skeleton of the heart.G4 The core of the skeleton is the central fibrous body, with its two extensions, the right

Common AV bundle courses along posteroinferior margin of membranous septum, giving off fibers that form the left bundle branch. This region lies beneath the commissure of right and noncoronary (posterior) aortic cusps. Right bundle branch originates from common AV bundle in the region of anteroinferior border of membranous septum.

**Figure 1-22** Cardiac valves viewed from superior aspect. Interrelationships of heart valves are shown, with aorta and semilunar aortic valve wedged between mitral and tricuspid valves. Pulmonary trunk and semilunar pulmonary valve are anterior and slightly to left of aortic valve. Left atrioventricular (mitral) valve has two leaflets: anterior (septal) and posterior (mural). Tricuspid valve has three leaflets: anterior, septal, and posterior.

and left fibrous trigones. The right fibrous trigone forms a dense junction between the mitral and tricuspid anuli, the left ventricular–aortic junction below the noncoronary cusp, and the membranous septum. The trigone is pierced by the bundle of His. The left fibrous trigone, situated more anteriorly and to the left, lies between the left ventricular–aortic junction and the mitral anulus. The tendon of the infundibulum is a fibrous band joining the more superiorly placed pulmonary valve to the central cardiac skeleton. The tendon of Todaro also joins the central fibrous body (see "Atrioventricular Node").

By virtue of similarities in morphology and function, the heart valves naturally fall into two groups: AV (mitral and tricuspid) valves and semilunar (aortic and pulmonary) valves.

#### Mitral Valve

The AV valve of the left ventricle, the mitral valve, is bicuspid, with an anterior (aortic, or septal) leaflet and a posterior (mural, or ventricular) leaflet (Fig. 1-23). Tissue that could be called *commissural leaflets* is usually present at the commissures between these two leaflets. The combined area of the two mitral leaflets is twice that of the mitral orifice, resulting in a large area of coaptation.P3,S17 When this large area is lost because of malalignment of the leaflets, undue stress is placed on the chordae tendineae, and they may rupture. Although there has been some controversy as to the definition of commissural areas, particularly in regard to clefts in the posterior leaflet, Silver and colleagues describe chordae tendineae that define the limits of the septal (anterior) and posterior leaflets.L1,R1 Rusted and colleagues found the depth of commissures in the normal mitral valve averaged 0.7 to 0.8 cm and never exceeded 1.3 cm in the 50 hearts they studied.R5

The larger *anterior* (septal, aortic, anteromedial) *leaflet* is roughly triangular in shape, with the base of the triangle inserting on about one third of the anulus. It has a relatively smooth free margin with few or no indentations. A distinct ridge separates the region of closure (rough zone) from the remaining leaflet (clear zone).R1 The clear zone is devoid of direct chordal insertions. The anterior leaflet is in fibrous continuity with the aortic valve through the aortic–mitral anulus and forms a boundary of the left ventricular outflow tract.W1 This region of continuity occupies about one fourth of the mitral anulus and corresponds to the region beneath half the left coronary cusp and half the noncoronary cusp of the aortic valve. The limits of this attachment are demarcated by the right and left fibrous trigones (Fig. 1-24). The commissure between the left and noncoronary sinuses of the aortic valve is located directly over the middle of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve (Fig. 1-25; see also Fig. 1-24). These points do not correspond to the commissures of the mitral valve (see Fig. 1-4). The AV node and bundle of His are at risk of surgical damage adjacent to the right trigone.

The smaller *posterior* (mural, ventricular, posterolateral) *leaflet* inserts into about two thirds of the anulus and typically has a scalloped appearance. Ranganathan and colleagues found the posterior leaflet to be divided into three segments in 46 of the 50 normal mitral valves they studied.R1 The posterior leaflet has rough and clear zones corresponding to those of the anterior leaflet, as well as a basal zone close to the anulus, which receives chordae directly from left ventricular trabeculae.L1,R1

The mitral valve leaflets may be described using a segmental classification. The valve leaflets are segmented into six sections, A1 to A3 for the anterior and P1 to P3 for the posterior (see Fig. 1-25, *C*). Sections A1 and P1 represent the anterolateral sections, A2 and P2 the middle sections, and A3 and P3 the posteromedial sections. This segmental classification has been useful in describing morphology observed at operation,K10 multiplane 2D transesophageal echocardiography,F4 and 3D echocardiography.C4

The majority of *chordae tendineae* to the mitral valve originate from the two large papillary muscles of the left ventricle: anterolateral and posteromedial. Each leaflet receives chordae from both papillary muscles, and the majority insert on the free leaflet edge.R5 Papillary muscles are often thought of as fingerlike structures protruding into the left ventricular cavity from the ventricular wall, possibly because these muscles are frequently visualized in two dimensions by angiography or echocardiography. Actually, the papillary muscles have a

(From Zimmerman.Z2)

somewhat crescent shape that conforms to the curvature of the free wall of the left ventricle. This is reasonable because the papillary muscles and chordae tendineae are derived embryologically by undermining of the left ventricular myocardium.

Victor and Nayak examined 100 normal human hearts at autopsy, evaluating and characterizing the papillary muscles and arrangement of the chordae.V17 The anterolateral papillary muscle is attached by chordae tendineae to the left half of the anterior and posterior mitral leaflets (as viewed by a surgeon through the usual right-side approach to the mitral valve), whereas the posteromedial papillary muscle is attached by chordae tendineae to the right-sided half of both anterior and posterior leaflets. Papillary muscles are considered an anterolateral "group" and a posteromedial "group" because there is often more than a single papillary muscle "belly." There are patterns of mostly single or two muscle bellies, but occasionally three, four, or even five bellies are observed. When there are three muscle bellies, the papillary muscle supporting the chordae to the commissure arises separately from the ventricular wall. Commissural chordae are shorter than the others and usually originate from the highest tip of the papillary muscle. Victor and Nayak also described variations of the chordal attachments. There are usually 4 to 12 chordae originating from each papillary muscle group (range, 2 to 22). Chordal branching results in a number of chordae inserting to the mitral valve leaflet, ranging from 12 to 80.

Acar and colleagues proposed a clinical morphologic classification of the papillary muscles.A3 A single undivided papillary muscle is referred to as *type I*. *Type II* refers to papillary muscles cleaved in a sagittal plane into two heads that separately support the anterior and posterior leaflets of the mitral valve. *Type III* papillary muscles are cleaved in a coronal plane, forming an individual head that supports the commissural chordae. *Type IV* refers to papillary muscles divided into multiple heads, with a separate papillary muscle originating as a separate muscular band close to the mitral anulus, which supports short chordae to the commissure.

Tandler defined three orders of chordae.T2 Those of the *first order* insert on the free margin of the leaflet, those of the *second order* insert a few to several millimeters back from the free edge, and those of the *third order* insert at the base of the leaflet (applicable only to the posterior leaflet).

**Figure 1-25** Anatomic relationships of mitral and aortic valves. **A,** Commissure between left and noncoronary sinuses of aortic valve is located directly above midpoint of anterior leaflet of mitral valve. Dashed line represents the midpoint of both anterior and posterior leaflets of mitral valve, separating the chordal attachments to anterior and posterior papillary muscles. **B,** Three-cusp semilunar aortic valve opens widely during systole without touching aortic wall, owing to sinuses of Valsalva. During diastole, mitral valve opens not only as anterior leaflet swings away from posterior leaflet but also as it flexes, to create the widest possible orifice. This is illustrated as a series of flexion lines. **C,** Segmental classification used to describe mitral valve morphology at surgery and two-dimensional and three-dimensional echocardiography.

Lam and colleagues reclassified chordae into *rough zone* (including strut chordae), *cleft, basal,* and *commissural chordae*. L1 These investigators suggest that this classification provides a clear definition of mitral valve leaflets and should be useful in studying mitral valve function.

The design of the mitral valve offers the largest possible orifice during the diastolic phase of ventricular filling and limits the slightest obstruction to flow at low pressures in the left atrium and left ventricle. The valve opens as the anterior leaflet swings anteriorly away from the posterior leaflet. Orifice dimensions are enhanced by flexion of the anterior leaflet (see Fig. 1-25, *B*). During systole, the mitral valve closes under the full load of left ventricular contraction. The anterior leaflet straightens and extends toward the posterior leaflet. The posterior leaflet functions like a shelf to stop the movement of the anterior leaflet as the leaflets appose.

#### Tricuspid Valve

The tricuspid valve, the AV valve of the right ventricle, has three leaflets: anterior, posterior, and septal (Fig. 1-26). Its orifice is roughly triangular and larger than the mitral orifice. The anulus is relatively indistinct, especially in the septal region. The leaflets and chordae tendineae are thinner than those of the mitral valve.B3,G5 Its orientation is nearly vertical.

The *anterior* (anterosuperior) *leaflet* is the largest of the three leaflets and may have notches creating subdivisions. Silver and colleagues found a notch close to the anteroseptal commissure in 47 of the 50 anterior leaflets they examined.S16 This notch was occasionally as deep as a commissure, but could be differentiated from a true commissure by the type of chordal attachments. The chordae attaching to this leaflet arise from anterior and medial papillary muscles. The anterior papillary muscle is the larger of the two, its base arising from the right ventricular free wall and trabecula septomarginalis.

The *posterior* (inferior) *leaflet* is usually the smallest and is commonly scalloped. Its chordae originate from the posterior and anterior papillary muscles. It is attached wholly to the ventricular free wall.

The *septal leaflet* is usually slightly larger than the posterior leaflet. Its chordae arise from the posterior and septal papillary muscles. Most of this leaflet and its chordae attach to the membranous and muscular portions of the ventricular septum, although part may attach to the posterior wall of the right ventricle. The transition between the attachments to the posterior wall and septum is associated with a fold in the leaflet.S16

Key: *ALTV,* Anterior leaflet; *APM,* anterior papillary muscle; *ASCTV,* anteroseptal commissure; *MPM,* medial papillary muscle; *PLTV,* posterior leaflet; *PPM,* posterior papillary muscle; *SLTV,*

Of major surgical importance is proximity of the conduction system to the septal leaflet and its anteroseptal commissure. The membranous septum usually lies beneath the septal leaflet inferior to the anteroseptal commissure, but attachments at the septal and anterior leaflets are variable, so parts of either may attach to the membranous septum. The bundle of His penetrates the right trigone beneath the interventricular component of the membranous septum (usually about 5 mm inferior to the commissure) and runs along the crest of the muscular septum (see Conduction System). That portion of the septal leaflet between the membranous septum and the commissure extends around the tricuspid anulus, away from the septum, to the right ventricular free wall (see Fig. 1-2). This portion of the tricuspid valve may form a flap over some VSDs.S10

#### Aortic Valve

The aortic valve is normally tricuspid and composed of delicate cusps and sinuses of Valsalva. These components form three cuplike structures that constitute the entire valve mechanism; the valve is in fibrous continuity with the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve and the membranous septum (see Fig. 1-25).

The free edge of each cusp is of tougher consistency than the remainder of the cusp. At the midpoint of each free edge is a fibrous *nodulus Arantii*. On either side of each nodulus is an extremely thin, crescent-shaped portion of the cusp termed the *lunula* (see Fig. 1-13). The lunulae are occasionally fenestrated near the commissures. These regions form the area of coaptation during valve closure.

The aortic sinuses (sinuses of Valsalva) are dilated pockets of the aortic root that form the outer component of the three cuplike closing structures of the aortic valve (see Fig. 1-25). The coronary arteries arise from two of the aortic sinuses. The walls of the sinuses are considerably thinner than the wall of the aorta proper,Z2 an important consideration when designing proximal aortotomies.

The crown-shaped anulus, fibrous trigones, aortic cusps, aortic sinuses, and sinutubular junction share a dynamic coordinated action to provide unidirectional transmission of large volumes of blood pumped intermittently through the channel while maintaining laminar flow, minimal resistance, optimal coronary artery flow, and least damage to blood elements during widely variable and frequently changing conditions.Y1

The origins of the coronary arteries are the basis of a nomenclature for the sinuses and cusps. The ostia of the right and left coronary arteries identify the right and left sinuses and cusps. The sinus and cusp without an associated coronary artery are termed *noncoronary*. Several other nomenclatures for the cusps and sinuses have been describedB3,G5,K3 (see Morphology in Chapter 52).

#### Pulmonary Valve

Pulmonary valve structure is similar to that of the aortic valve.G5 The pulmonary valve normally has three cusps, with a nodule at the midpoint of each free edge, and lunulae and thin, crescent-shaped coaptive surfaces on both sides of the nodules. The pocket behind each cusp is the sinus. Major differences from the aortic valve are (1) lighter construction of pulmonary valve cusps,G4,G5 (2) normal absence of coronary artery origins, and (3) normal lack of fibrous continuity with the anterior tricuspid valve leaflet. Pulmonary valve cusps are supported entirely by freestanding musculature, having no direct relationship with the ventricular septum.M5 The pulmonary valve is lifted away from the ventricular septum by the subpulmonary infundibulum. The first septal branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery pierces the

ventricular septum below the shortest part of the subpulmonary infundibulum. The artery is protected by the subpulmonary infundibulum.

Pulmonary valve cusps have been described by several terminologies, <sup>B3,G5,K3</sup> usually named by their relationships to the aortic valve: *right*, *left*, and *anterior* (nonseptal). Kerr and Goss found that a commissure of the pulmonary valve was adjacent to a commissure of the aortic valve in 199 of 200 specimens they studied. <sup>K3</sup> These investigators suggested that the cusps of each arterial valve should be termed *right adjacent*, *left adjacent*, and *opposite* (or, as suggested by Anderson, *right facing*, *left facing*, and *nonfacing*) in relationship to the adjacent commissure of each valve.

#### **CORONARY ARTERIES**

From an anatomic point of view, the coronary artery system divides naturally into two distributions, left and right. From the standpoint of the surgeon, the coronary artery system is divided into four parts: the left main coronary artery, the left anterior descending coronary artery and its branches, the left circumflex coronary artery and its branches, and the right

coronary artery and its branches. The branches of each of the last three vessels must also be familiar to the surgeon.

The major coronary arteries form a circle and a loop about the heart D3,S24 (Fig. 1-27). The circle is formed by the right coronary and left circumflex arteries as they traverse the AV sulci. The loop between the ventricles and at right angles to the circle is formed by the left anterior descending (interventricular) coronary artery and the posterior descending (interventricular) coronary artery as they encircle the septum. Blood supply to the back of the left ventricle streams down as a series of parallel obtuse marginal arteries coming from the posterior half of the circle, formed on the left by the left circumflex artery and on the right (in hearts with a dominant right coronary circulation) by the extension of the right coronary artery across the crux cordis, the area along the posterior aspect of the AV groove where the atrial and ventricular septa meet, termed the right posterolateral segment. This latter segment supplies inferior surface (marginal) branches to the inferior (diaphragmatic) surface of the left ventricle.

Although the right coronary artery may not supply a large portion of the posterior left ventricular wall, it nevertheless serves the left side of the heart to a greater extent than it does the right side in terms of the number and volume of vessel segments involved.Z1 A right dominant artery does not necessarily supply branches to the inferior surface of the left ventricle, however, because it may terminate only as the posterior descending artery. Blood supply to the anterior portion of the left ventricle comes from the diagonal branches of this portion of the loop, the left anterior descending coronary artery. That to the lateral part of the anterior portion comes from the first branches of both the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries. The ventricular septum receives its blood supply from the loop that encircles it, formed by the left anterior descending coronary artery in front and the posterior descending artery behind.

Variability in the origin of the posterior descending artery is expressed by the term *dominance*. A right dominant coronary circulation is one in which the posterior descending coronary artery is a terminal branch of the right coronary artery. A left dominant circulation, which occurs in about 10% to 15% of hearts, is one in which the posterior descending coronary artery is a branch, usually the last one, of the left circumflex coronary artery. Left dominance occurs more frequently in males than in females. This distinction as to whether the right or left coronary artery supplies the posterior descending artery is important in evaluating patients with coronary artery disease and in planning coronary artery bypass grafting.

The following is a general description of coronary artery anatomy in normal hearts.B1,F6,G1,J2,M3,S24,V18 As with the conduction system, some congenital cardiac malformations are associated with abnormalities of the coronary arteries. The nomenclature is based on the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's *Proposal and Manual of Operations for Collaborative Studies in Coronary Artery Surgery*N3 (Fig. 1-28) and the American Heart Association's coronary artery disease reporting system.A5 Both systems include rules for defining the various segments of the major coronary arteries. Fig. 1-29 is also supplied to provide a more dimensional representation of the coronary arteries on the surface of the heart and should be studied along with the brief descriptions that follow.

#### Left Main Coronary Artery

The left main coronary artery extends from the ostium in the left sinus of Valsalva to its bifurcation into the left anterior descending and left circumflex branches. Its usual length is 10 to 20 mm, with a range of 0 to 40 mm. It normally courses between the pulmonary trunk and the left atrial appendage to reach the left AV groove. Occasionally, additional vessels originate from the left main coronary artery and course parallel to the diagonal branches of the left anterior descending branch.J2 Such an additional artery (formerly called a *ramus intermedius*) is termed the *first diagonal branch* of the left anterior descending artery. Rarely (in 1% of persons), the left main coronary artery is absent, the left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary arteries originating directly from the aorta via separate ostia.

#### Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery

Beginning as a continuation of the left main coronary artery, the left anterior descending coronary artery courses along the anterior interventricular sulcus to the apex of the heart. Part

(Modified from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Coronary Artery Surgery Study [CASS].C2)

of it may be buried in muscle. In most cases, this artery extends around the apex into the posterior interventricular sulcus, supplying the apical portion of both right and left ventricles.J2 This vessel supplies branches to the right ventricular free wall (usually small), septum, and left ventricular free wall. One or more branches to the right ventricle connect with infundibular branches from the proximal right coronary artery. This important route for collateral flow is the *loop of Vieussens*. The *septal arteries* arise almost perpendicularly

**Figure 1-29** Coronary arteries. **A,** Left coronary artery. Left main coronary artery originates from aorta and divides to form left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary arteries. Branches of left anterior descending artery on surface of heart are termed *diagonal arteries*, whereas those coursing into the ventricular septum are called *septal arteries*. Branches of left circumflex artery on posterior wall of left ventricular surface are termed *obtuse marginal arteries*. A large artery originating near the left main coronary bifurcation and supplying the obtuse margin between the diagonal branches of left anterior descending and circumflex marginal branches was formerly called an *intermediate branch* or *ramus intermedius*. **B,** Right coronary artery, right dominant pattern. Right coronary artery originates from aorta and courses in the atrioventricular (AV) groove. Branches of right coronary artery supplying blood to right ventricle are called *right ventricular branches*, except for the nearly constant and often large branch at the acute margin of the heart, termed the *acute marginal artery*. Right coronary artery divides at the crux of the heart into right posterior descending branch, which courses over posterior aspect of ventricular septum, and right posterolateral segment artery, which continues in the AV groove, providing branches to posterior wall of left ventricle. Arterial branches to the specialized conduction system frequently arise from right coronary artery. Sinoatrial node branch originates from proximal portion of right coronary artery. AV node branch originates from the U-bend in posterior lateral segment of right coronary artery.

![](_page_21_Picture_3.jpeg)

from the left anterior descending coronary artery, a characteristic sometimes helpful in angiographic identification of the anterior descending artery. A variable number of *diagonal arteries* course obliquely between the anterior descending and left circumflex arteries and supply the left ventricular free wall anteriorly and laterally.

Variations in the left anterior descending artery are infrequent, although in about 4% of hearts, it exists as two parallel vessels of about equal size. It may terminate before the apex or extend as far as the posterior AV groove.

#### Left Circumflex Coronary Artery

The left circumflex coronary artery originates from the left main coronary artery at about a 90-degree angle, with its initial few centimeters lying medial to the base of the left atrial appendage. The sinus node artery occasionally originates from the first few millimeters of the left circumflex artery. Rarely, the circumflex artery terminates before the obtuse margin. A large branch originating from the proximal left circumflex artery and coursing around the left atrium near the AV groove is termed the *atrial circumflex artery*. The ventricular branches of the circumflex artery, the *obtuse marginal arteries,* supply the obtuse margin of the heart and may be embedded in muscle. Often their position can then be identified at operation by the altered color (reddish or light tan) of the overlying thin muscle layer compared with that of the remainder of the ventricular wall. Those branches supplying the inferior surface of the left ventricle in a heart with a left dominant system (or in one with a co-dominant system in which the right coronary artery gives rise only to a posterior descending artery) are termed *left posterolateral* (marginal) *arteries*. In hearts with a left dominant system, the left circumflex coronary artery gives rise to the *posterior descending artery* at or usually before the crux. Variations in the origin and length of the left circumflex artery, and in the number and size of its marginal branches, are common.

#### Right Coronary Artery

The right coronary artery is usually a single large artery and courses down the right AV groove. Branches supplying the anterior right ventricular free wall exit from the AV sulcus in a looping fashion because of the depth of the right coronary artery in the sulcus. In this same area, the anterior right atrial artery arises, and this branch often gives origin to the sinus node artery. More distally, a lateral right atrial artery usually arisesB14 (this artery is frequently severed when an oblique right atriotomy is made). In the region of the acute margin of the heart, a relatively constant long branch of the right coronary artery arises, the *acute marginal artery,* which courses most of the way to the apex of the heart. The right coronary artery in most hearts crosses the crux, where it takes a characteristic deep U-turn, giving off the *atrioventricular node artery* at the apex of the turn. The right coronary artery then terminates by bifurcating into the *right posterior descending coronary artery* and the *right posterolateral segment artery*. The *posterior descending coronary artery* descends in the posterior interventricular sulcus for a variable distance, giving rise to septal, right ventricular, and left ventricular branches. Variations in its anatomy are numerous, and it frequently arises before the crux. The right posterolateral segment of the right coronary artery gives origin to marginal branches to the inferior surface of the left ventricle in most hearts with a right dominant system.

Variations in the right coronary artery are common. It may have a dual origin from the right sinus of Valsalva. In about 10% of hearts, it bifurcates within a few millimeters of the aortic ostium, forming two diverging trunks of equal size. In half the cases, the artery supplying the right ventricular infundibulum arises separately from the aortic sinus and is then termed the *conus artery*. J2,S5 The *sinoatrial node* (sinus node) *artery* originates from the second or third centimeter of the right coronary artery in many hearts (see "Coronary Arterial Supply to Specialized Areas of the Heart").J2 The acute marginal artery crosses the diaphragmatic surface of the right ventricle in 10% to 20% of hearts and reaches the anterior aspect of the diaphragmatic portion of the ventricular septum, to which it gives branches.A4

#### Coronary Arterial Supply to Specialized Areas of the Heart

The predominant blood supply to the ventricular septum is from the left anterior descending coronary artery via four to six large septal arteries 70 to 80 mm in length.J5,J6 In contrast, the septal arteries from the posterior descending coronary artery (except for the AV node artery) are rarely more than 15 mm in length (Fig. 1-30). They supply only a small zone of the ventricular septum near the posterior interventricular sulcus and in the region of the AV node. The septal arteries from the posterior descending artery may, however, serve as an important source of collateral circulation. Until their final terminations, the septal arteries from both anterior and posterior descending arteries course along the right ventricular side of the septum, where pressure is lower than on the left side.J6 In the 10% of hearts with a left dominant circulation, the entire blood supply is from the left coronary artery.

The sinus node artery is a single artery in 89% and double in 11% of hearts.S25 Its origin is from the right coronary artery in 55% to 65% of cases and from the left circumflex or left main coronary artery in the remainder. When it arises from the right coronary artery, it courses posteriorly and superiorly over the anterior wall of the right atrium beneath the right atrial appendage to the base of the superior vena cava (Fig. 1-31). The sinus node artery may penetrate the interatrial septum in its course to the superior vena cava. It then encircles the cava clockwise or counterclockwise, or bifurcates and encircles it in both directions. If the sinus node artery arises from the left circumflex artery, it courses over the left atrial wall, variably penetrates the interatrial septum, and ascends to the base of the superior vena cava, encircling that vessel as when it originates from the right coronary artery.

The AV node artery arises from the characteristic U-turn of the right coronary artery as it crosses the crux of the heart. The AV node is usually supplied by the dominant coronary artery. The AV node artery courses superiorly and anteriorly and terminates with a distinctive angulation.S24 An important accessory blood supply to the AV node is *Kugel artery,* which originates from the proximal segment of either the right coronary artery or the left circumflex artery and courses through the interatrial septum to the crux of the heart to anastomose with the AV node artery. In the atrial septum, Kugel artery anastomoses with branches of the sinus node artery.J2 Kugel artery is the source of blood supply to the AV node in 40% of normal hearts.A1 The *right superior*

*descending artery* supplied the AV node in 70% of hearts studied by Abuin and Nieponice.A1 This atrial vessel has its origin within the first centimeter of the right coronary artery, giving branches to the ventriculoinfundibular fold of the right ventricle, penetrating the right atrium, and continuing along the anterior border of the fossa ovalis. The artery goes through the central fibrous body and supplies the bundle of His and the area within the triangle of Koch, including the AV node. Kugel artery and the right superior descending artery are at risk of injury in operations requiring dissection around the right coronary artery (aortic root replacement, Ross procedure) and in the AV groove (extended transseptal approaches to the mitral valve).A2

The bundle of His and proximal few millimeters of the main bundle branches are supplied by the AV node artery. The remainder of the bundle branches and the Purkinje arborization within the septum are supplied by septal arteries originating from the left anterior descending artery.

The anterolateral papillary muscle of the right ventricle, located near the junction of apical septum and free wall, is supplied by branches from the left anterior descending coronary artery. The anterolateral papillary muscle of the left ventricle is supplied primarily by one or more branches from the left anterior descending coronary artery, but it may also be supplied by circumflex marginal branches. The arterial supply of the posteromedial papillary muscle of the left ventricle is from terminal branches of the right or circumflex arteries, depending on the distribution of these arteries to the inferior surface of the left ventricle.

#### DIMENSIONS OF NORMAL CARDIAC AND GREAT ARTERY PATHWAYS

Cardiac and great artery pathways with normal dimensions accommodate blood flow at rest and during exercise and stress, with little or no pressure drop across the pathway. Sluysmans and Colan have hypothesized that optimal size of cardiovascular structures is such as to mimic hemodynamic cost of providing blood flow across the physiologic range of cardiac output.S20 The body does this by optimizing the relationship between vessel radius and flow rate. To achieve minimum work requires minimizing viscous energy (shear stress related to inverse radius) and inertial energy related to pulsatile flow, which is directly related to radius (Fig. 1-32). Sluymans and Colan show that this optimization of energy is related to body surface area (BSA) over a wide range of sizes of mammals, including humans. For valve and blood vessel area, this relationship is linear with BSA; for diameter of vessels, this relationship is to the square root of BSA (BSA0.5).

Although the theoretical relationship tolerates vessel dimensions over a substantial range, in some patients being considered for cardiac surgery, dimensions are so small as to preclude a satisfactory outcome. Therefore, prediction of outcome based on dimensions of a pathway becomes important. A major problem in predicting outcome in a patient simply from subjective evaluation of the size of a structure is that this evaluation may be grossly inaccurate because of unconscious comparison of the size of the structure in question with that of a neighboring unusually large structure. Prediction of outcome simply from subjective evaluation is also affected by the preformed bias of the observer, as well as by inexperience. Therefore, measurements and their relationship to outcome are required for reproducible, accurate

Energy loss per second (erg · s<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> ) due to viscous friction *(red line)* is plotted against the radius of the aortic valve (cm). On the same scale, the inertial energy content of blood *(gold line)* and total energy loss calculated as the sum of viscous energy loss and inertial energy content loss *(blue line)* are plotted for theoretical cardiac outputs (QS) of 3.5 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> **(A)** and 17.5 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> **(B)**, representing the theoretical cardiac output at rest and at maximal exercise of a normal subject with a body surface area (BSA) of 1 m2 . The least amount of total energy loss per unit time corresponds to the minimum of the total energy loss curve. The corresponding radius is 0.45 cm for 3.5 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> flow and 0.8 cm for 17.5 L · min<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> flow. These values represent the theoretical range of normal optimal aortic valve radius for this BSA. (From Sluysmans and Colan.S20)

The measured dimension is usually expressed as diameter of the pathway. Occasionally a circular shape is assumed, and the dimension is transformed to cross-sectional area. Under some circumstances, cross-sectional area can be measured directly. In other circumstances, an elliptical shape is assumed, and major and minor axes are measured and area calculated with an equation that applies to ellipses.

Use of observed (measured) dimensions generally requires their being related to normal dimensions, which vary with body size and age (allometric growth). Normal dimensions may also vary according to imaging modality, image projection (e.g., anteroposterior vs. lateral), phase of the cardiac cycle, method of fixation in the case of specimens, and other factors. These must be specifically controlled in making the measurements.

Dimensions have been measured in autopsy specimens<sup>C1,C4,R4,U1</sup> and by cineangiography (in which dimensions must be corrected for magnification), echocardiography (M-mode, 2D, 3D<sup>B5,C3,N4,S1,S4</sup>), and in a few instances MRI. However, normal values are not available in each of these modalities, so dimensions have to be related to available normal values, even if from another modality.

Echocardiography has evolved as the most commonly used modality for measuring these dimensions. Pathway dimensions have been determined by echocardiography at nearly all ages of life, from fetal to age 90. Hornberger and colleagues established dimensions by high-resolution 2D echocardiography for the fetal aortic arch in 92 fetuses aged 16 to 38 weeks gestation to facilitate diagnosis of left heart and aortic abnormalities, particularly coarctation. Skelton and colleagues followed changes in cardiac dimensions of preterm infants during the first month of life, suggesting there are differences from term infants, with preterm babies showing mild left ventricular dysfunction.

Pathway dimensions for hearts from birth to about 20 years have been determined by M-mode<sup>KI</sup> and 2D<sup>S9</sup> echocardiography. Daubeney and colleagues'D2 prospective study aimed at developing equations relating cardiac dimensions to body area over the range of 0.1 to 2.0 m<sup>2</sup> is particularly useful. A number of studies in adults use 2D echocardiography (transthoracic or transesophageal) with pathway dimensions measured directly or derived from Doppler ultrasound measurements and the continuity equation. The age range is often wide, but there are populations studied at mean age 23, D11 28, S18 33, D4 45, C8 and 53 years. S31 Swinne and colleagues<sup>S31</sup> call attention to age-associated changes in left ventricular outflow tract geometry observed in normal subjects, mostly after age 70. These changes consist of a more acute septoaortic angle or septal bulge that is not associated with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. These may represent degenerative changes associated with aging.

#### Normalization of Pathway Dimensions

Pathway dimensions may be used without any normalization to body size or age. Some cardiologists who work exclusively with adult patients express aortic size simply in centimeters. This method is not recommended, not only for the obvious reason that it is unacceptable when the population being considered consists of patients who range from very young to very old, but also because it takes no account of differences between adults of differing size.

Normalization may be based on age, height, weight, or BSA. Normalization to body size generally is termed *indexing*. Normalization may also be to another structure, such as the size of the descending aorta at the diaphragm. Normalization to another body structure generally is termed a *ratio*. The preference is for normalization to BSA of the patient, but this is often done by dividing the value of the dimension by the BSA, expressing it as "per square meter BSA." This preference presumes a strictly linear relation between the dimension and BSA, which may be inaccurate. If a structure's *area* is measured, the relationship to BSA is probably accurate. If instead a *diameter* of a structure is normalized this

way, it will be inaccurate. What must be achieved is normalization that is constant across body size from smallest neonate to adult.

Indexed cross-sectional area and diameter of mitral and tricuspid valves, left ventricular-aortic junction (aortic valve "anulus"), right ventricular infundibulum, and right ventricular-pulmonary trunk junction (pulmonary valve "anulus") in normal individuals are summarized in Table 1-1 according to the modality in which the dimension was measured. Those for the pulmonary trunk, right and left pulmonary arteries, and descending thoracic aorta at the diaphragm are summarized in Table 1-2. Values for the diameter of the upper descending thoracic aorta on both sides of the ductus arteriosus are also available. VI These tables are not intended as a source of normalized dimensions in patients, but rather as a reference and guide to the appendixes to this chapter, which contain specific regression equations and nomograms for calculating mean normal values and their standard deviations for use in patients.

#### Standardization of Dimensions

Values of dimensions are made useful by standardizing them to body size. They are expressed as deviation from their mean normal value for body size in terms of number of standard deviations from the mean. Standardization takes into account the fact that values in normal individuals of the same size vary. The mathematical framework for standardization of dimensions is the normal distribution domain because of its mathematical flexibility and tractability. This framework may require transformation of the dimension scale of the variable under consideration to comply with assumptions of the normal distribution.

A less desirable alternative is standardization according to percentiles (the 50th percentile is the median). This method is commonly used in relating body weight or height to age. Although percentiles are easily expressed, the method has the major disadvantage that the relationships cannot be reduced to equations. This increases the difficulty of relating dimensional data to outcome.

Once in the normal distribution domain, any given value for a dimension can be expressed in terms of the number of standard deviations of the given value from the mean value of that dimension in normal individuals. This is the z value, or z score (Fig. 1-33). The transformation to a dimensionless z value is as follows:

## $z = \frac{\text{Observed dimension}^{(1)} - \text{Mean normal dimension}^{(2)}}{\text{Standard deviation around mean normal dimension}^{(3)}}$

where (1) is the observed dimension or its appropriate transformation in scale in the patient who is of a known size (BSA), and (2) and (3) refer to corresponding values in normal individuals of the same BSA as the patient, obtained from regression analysis and equations.

Appendix 1B includes dimensions (obtained at autopsy) of various cardiac and pulmonary artery pathways in normal individuals. In Appendix 1C, the dimensions were obtained at in vivo cineangiography, and in Appendix 1D at in vivo 2D echocardiography. Appendix 1E compares pathway dimensions in normal individuals from different measurement modalities. Additional reliable information is contained in other sources (e.g., Roman et al. R3).

**Figure 1-33** Depiction of relationship of the *z* value of a patient's dimension to the percentage of a population of normal individuals with that specific dimension or a smaller one. Exact percentage on vertical axis, related by dashed lines to the patient *z* value, is the percentile of normal individuals with the corresponding *z* value. A patient with a specific *z* value has the dimension of the corresponding percentile of the normal population.

#### Dimensions of the Pulmonary Arteries

Indexing and standardizing the dimensions of the pulmonary arteries present special problems because of the multiplicity of methods that have been used. They have been important in considering treatment for patients with tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary stenosis, tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia, and conditions for which the Fontan operation is performed.

Among the different methods for expressing dimensions of the pulmonary arteries are the McGoon ratio, <sup>B9,P4</sup> the sum of the diameters of the prebranching portions of the right and left pulmonary arteries, pulmonary artery area index (PAAI), <sup>S12</sup> cross-sectional area index (Nakata index), <sup>N1</sup> and *z* value. The *z* value is the preferred method. It should be applied to more distal portions of the pulmonary arteries as well.

To facilitate transformation of already published dimensions of the pulmonary arteries in patients with congenital heart disease to a different normalization, relationships between the values obtained by these various methods are shown in Appendix 1F.

#### Relating Dimensions to Outcome

The goal is an equation expressing the continuously variable relationship between normalized dimensions of the patient and some outcome event (e.g., death, freedom from reoperation, postrepair  $P_{RV/LV}$ , cardiac index). Obtaining the equation may require detailed studies and complex analyses, but once obtained, the equation is made easy to use by expressing it in a nomogram. This process is the basis of many of the depictions in the subsequent chapters.

As is already evident from Appendixes 1B, 1C, and 1D, the normalization used in relating dimensions to outcome can be to measurements made at autopsy or at cineangiography, 2D echocardiography, MRI, or other imaging method. Although in theory it may seem proper to normalize

measurements made on cineangiography, for example, using normalizing equations based on cineangiographic measurements, this is in fact unnecessary. If the same method of normalizing the patient's dimensions is used in predicting outcome as was used in previous studies that determined the relationship between dimensions and outcome, this suffices. For example, in normalizing measurements of the dimensions of the tricuspid valve made at cineangiography, one might like to use equations based on cineangiographic measurements. Unfortunately, an insufficient number of measurements is made at cineangiography in normal individuals to generate equations for indexing or standardizing tricuspid measurements by this modality.

Equations for standardization of tricuspid measurements using measurements obtained by 2D echocardiography are available, as are measurements made at autopsy. C1,R4 Based on these practical considerations, normalization to autopsy or echocardiographic measurements may be used for standardizing tricuspid dimensions to a z value, even though these measurements are made by cineangiography (see Appendix 1E). Thus the nomograms shown in Appendix 1D or the actual equations described in tables in Appendixes 1B through 1D may be used. However, once a disparate standardization of a dimension is related to outcome, the user of that relationship must make that *identical* standardization. This is analogous to the use of a ruler. Rulers may be subdivided into inches or centimeters, but once a scale is chosen, it must be used consistently.

#### **DIMENSIONS OF NORMAL VENTRICLES**

Normal ventricular volumes, masses, and dimensions—assuming normal myocardial contractility and loading conditions—can accommodate normal blood flow at rest and during exercise. Sometimes the dimensions of the left or right ventricle are smaller or larger than those of the other, leading to problems in simply *judging* the normality of the size and its relationship to outcome, for the same reasons as in the case of pathway dimensions.

Accurate and precise ventricular diameters, P2 volumes, and masses are difficult to obtain, because ventricles may have unusual shapes. Nevertheless, a number of useful studies have been done that use M-mode and 2D directed M-mode echocardiography to determine left ventricular volume and mass and to relate these dimensions to body size over the life course of humans. D1,D9,G6,G7,H9 Particularly interesting is de Simone and colleagues'D8 study of left ventricular mass in overweight children and adults. They found that height is the best means of normalizing left ventricular mass. Normalization of ventricles to body size has also been challenged for obese subjects by Whalley and colleagues. W3 BSA is highly sensitive to weight, less so to height. Whalley and colleagues support normalizing to fat-free mass, but requirement of specialized equipment is a barrier to its widespread use. Their view is not shared by all. S20 Vasan and colleagues<sup>V16</sup> provide "cut" limits for range of normal values (90th and 95th percentiles) for ventricular mass and thickness and atrial and ventricular dimensions derived from nearly 5000 subjects in the Framingham Heart Study. Bull and colleagues<sup>B13</sup> proposed making surgical decisions based on the size (in terms of z values) of the AV valve guarding the entrance to the ventricle, rather than on the size of the ventricle itself.

The *z* value method (standardization) can be used to describe patients' ventricular volumes and masses, although this general body of knowledge is not yet well developed, in part because of methodological problems. The *z* value method can also be used for diameters. Table 1-3 gives the mean values for normal individuals of various body sizes, as an approximation and for guidance rather than for use in calculating patient-specific *z* values. Appendix Fig. 1G-1 presents the information in a form from which patient-specific *z* values can be calculated.

#### TERMINOLOGY AND CLASSIFICATION OF HEART DISEASE

Understanding the morphology of heart disease is fundamental to its surgical treatment. Morphology could be described fully using any one of a number of systems of terminology and classification. However, appropriate and accurate terminology and classification are important because they greatly facilitate understanding and teaching of cardiac morphology, diagnosis, and surgical treatment. Also, they determine the method of categorization of cases, a procedure essential to the study of groups of patients.

The system of terminology and classification used here evolved over many years, to a considerable extent in response to clinical, and particularly surgical, needs. It was based originally on the teaching of Edwards and his pupil, Becu. It has been profoundly influenced and modified on numerous occasions by the work of Van Praagh, has benefited through the years from the work of Van Mierop and of Lev and Bharati, and has embraced many of the concepts of Anderson and Becker.A12,B6

Following the ideas of Lev, terminology based on the somewhat shifting sands of embryology has been avoided as much as possible. Any terms that have embryologic implications are used only because they have become conventional. This is not to deny the importance of the science of embryology, but rather to emphasize the importance of precise description of morphology (see Appendix 1A). Complete description of a cardiac anomaly includes the anatomic variables listed in Box 1-1. B6,B11,K6,K7,S14,V10

Nomenclature and classification schemes are essential for accurate data reporting and establishment of databases. A continuing worldwide effort of surgeons, cardiologists, morphologists, perfusionists, pathologists, and government officials has resulted in the International Pediatric and Congenital Cardiac Code (IPCCC).F5 The framework of this effort will serve as a guideline for future efforts at classification of cardiac morphology. These efforts have not as yet embraced a true ontology of congenital heart disease that, at least in theory, could integrate with a cardiovascular Gene Ontology to couple phenotype with genotype.

#### Situs of the Thoracic Viscera and Atria

The possible situs of the thoracic viscera and atria are (1) situs solitus, or usual situs, (2) situs inversus, and (3) situs ambiguus. *Situs solitus* means that the right/left relationships of the asymmetric viscera and the atria are usual. That is, the right (eparterial) and left (hyparterial) mainstem bronchi are normally positioned, the right atrium is to the right of the left atrium, and the left atrium is to the left. *Situs inversus* indicates that the right/left relationships are the opposite of

usual. In chemical language, these are *isomers*. With rare exceptions, atrial and thoracic visceral situs are the same (concordant). *Situs ambiguus* is the absence of lateralization in the thoracic organs and atrial chambersV3,V4; in the latter case, this condition is termed *atrial isomerism* (see Chapter

58). It is usually but not invariably associated with lack of abdominal lateralization—that is, asplenia or polysplenia.

In asplenia and polysplenia, the usually asymmetric structures tend to be symmetric. In both, in contrast to normal, the length of the right and left mainstem bronchi is the same, as is the relation of each bronchus to its pulmonary artery and the configuration of the artery.L2,P1,V3 Persons with *asplenia* tend to have bilateral right-sidedness and right atrial isomerism, a condition identifiedS14,S30 by finding the righttype configuration of mainstem bronchus and its pulmonary artery on both left and right sides (the bronchus is relatively short and posterior and superior to the pulmonary artery, which bifurcates into an upper and lower trunk).B10,L2,S30 Patients with *polysplenia* tend to have bilateral left-sidednessM7 and left atrial isomerism, with the left-type configuration of the mainstem bronchus and its pulmonary artery on both sides (the bronchus is anterior and inferior to the pulmonary artery, which gives off individual branches rather than a discrete trunk to the upper lobe).

A determination of situs can sometimes be made by study of the plain chest radiograph.S23 When there is situs ambiguus, a common atrium is often present, and only the morphology of the atrial appendages indicates whether there is right or left atrial isomerism (see Chapter 58). Complex forms of congenital heart disease tend to occur in patients with atrial isomerism,L6,L9,M7,S30 although in rare cases the heart is normal.

#### Situs of the Ventricles

In situs solitus, ventricles are said to have normal (usual, concordant) situs when the morphologically right ventricle is anterior and to the right of the morphologically left ventricle, which is posterior and to the left. Van Praagh's term, *D-loop,*V10,V11,V13 may be used to describe this ventricular situs or isomer, as may his term *right-handedness*, V8,V15 also used by Anderson.A8 *D-loop* indicates that the *sinus portion* of the morphologically right ventricle is to the right vis-à-vis that of the left. In hearts with D-loop (as described by Van PraaghV15), direction of blood flow in the right ventricle is from right to left through the right-sided tricuspid valve and inflow (sinus) portion to the usually left-sided outflow portion (infundibulum). D-loop or right-handedness can also be defined as existing when the palmar surface of the right hand can be placed on the septal surface of the right ventricle such that the thumb is in the inlet (tricuspid valve), the wrist is in the apical trabecular component, and the fingers are in the outlet (pulmonary valve).

In situs solitus, ventricles are said to be *inverted* when the morphologically right ventricle is more or less posterior and to the left of the morphologically left ventricle; Van Praagh's term, *L-loop,* applies here, as does the term *left-handedness*. In L-loop, the sinus (inlet) portion of the morphologically right ventricle is to the left vis-à-vis that of left ventricle; that is, internal organization is opposite of that in D-loop, and direction of blood flow is from the left-sided tricuspid valve to the right-sided infundibulum. L-loop, or left-handedness, can also be defined as existing when the palmar surface of the left hand can be placed on the septal surface of the right ventricle such that the thumb is in the inlet, the wrist is in the apical trabecular component, and the fingers are in the outlet. L.M. Bargeron (UAB; personal communication) suggested that looking through the right ventricle's AV valve toward its apex, in D-loop the septal structures are to the left, and in L-loop they are to the right.

In atrial situs inversus, L-loop is the normal (usual, concordant) situs and D-loop is the inverted situs. The definitions of loop, or handedness, are independent of atrial or visceral situs and are thus the same as just described. Because there are two possible ventricular situses (D-loop and L-loop) in both atrial situs solitus and atrial situs inversus, there are four basic hearts, an idea expressed many years ago by Stanger, Edwards, and colleaguesS29 (see Appendix 1H).

When thoracic and atrial situs are ambiguous, only ventricular situs can be described, and its relationship to thoracic and atrial situs is "ambiguus."

#### Completeness of the Ventricles

Both the right and left ventricle may be considered to have inlet, sinus, and outlet portions when complete. Either ventricle may be incomplete (or rudimentary). For example, the inlet portion of the right ventricle is absent in hearts with tricuspid atresia.

#### Dominance of the Ventricles

Normally, the size of the two ventricles is similar and can be said to be *balanced*. In many kinds of cardiac conditions, one ventricle is larger, or dominant, and the smaller one can be severely hypoplastic. The dominance may be mild, moderate, or severe. Generally, a ventricle is said to be dominant only when the other ventricle is too small to maintain adequate pulmonary or systemic blood flow.

#### Cardiac Connections

Information about cardiac connections is fundamental in describing any malformed heart and requires elucidation at both AV and ventriculoarterial levels. The AV connection may be *concordant* (right atrium3 connects to right ventricle;

The adjectives *left* and *right* used to modify atrium or ventricle mean *morphologically* right or left. The *position* of the chamber is referred to as *right-sided* or *left-sided*.

left atrium connects to left ventricle), *discordant* (right atrium connects to left ventricle; left atrium connects to right ventricle), *univentricular* (atria connect to only one ventricle; see Chapter 56 for more details of this subset), or *ambiguus* (situs ambiguus of atria). When an AV valve is *straddling,* it is considered to be connected to the ventricle into which more than 50% of the valve orifice faces. As Bharati and colleagues have pointed out, it is pertinent to distinguish between straddling of the *valve anulus* across the septum and of the *chordal attachments* into an inappropriate ventricle.B8 Milo and colleagues suggested that the term *overriding* be used when referring to the anulus, and *straddling* when referring to chordal attachments.M6

The *ventriculoarterial connection* may be concordant (left ventricle connects wholly or nearly so to aorta; right ventricle to pulmonary artery) or discordant (right ventricle connects to aorta, left ventricle to pulmonary artery, commonly called *transposition of the great arteries*V12). As with AV connections, when a semilunar valve is overriding a VSD, it is considered to be connected to the ventricle from which more than 50% of the valve area arises. The connection may also be *double outlet* (great arteries arise wholly or for the most part from one ventricle).

The ventriculoarterial connection may be considered *single outlet* when there is a common arterial trunk (truncus arteriosus communis) or only a single artery, usually the aorta, connected to a ventricle. In the latter case, there is usually pulmonary atresia, and categorization as single outlet ventriculoarterial connection, although morphologically precise, considerably complicates the presentation of information in many types of congenital heart disease. Alternatively, the ventriculoarterial connections can be termed *concordant, discordant,* or *double outlet* by identifying the connection, although atretic, of the pulmonary artery to a ventricle. Even when there is a ventriculopulmonary artery discontinuity, this is often possible. For example, when the morphology is typical for tetralogy of Fallot, except that there is only a single ventricular outlet because of pulmonary atresia, the condition is called *tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia* (see Chapter 38).

#### Cardiac and Arterial Positions

Normally, the cardiac apex points to the left, a situation called *levocardia*. The term *dextrocardia* applies when the cardiac apex points to the right, and *mesocardia* when it is in the midline. There is merit to using the term *dextroversion* to denote dextrocardia with situs solitus of the viscera and atria, and *levoversion* to denote levocardia with situs inversus. Dextroversion and levoversion alter the geometry and position of all cardiac chambers. Thus, the position of the heart is important surgically, but it is not a basic abnormality, as is D- or L-loop. The left atrium is generally to the left and the right atrium to the right in situs solitus, and vice versa in situs inversus.

Position of the ventricles is determined primarily but not exclusively by the ventricular situs (loop or handedness). The morphologically right ventricle is usually anterior and to the right in D-loop, and the left ventricle posterior and to the left. Generally, with L-loop (inverted ventricles), the morphologically left ventricle is anterior and to the right, and the morphologically right ventricle is posterior and to the left. However, the ventricles may be side by side or directly anteroposterior to each other, with either ventricle in either position. Ventricles may also be in a superoinferior (over and under) position; this occurs most commonly with L-loop but can occur with D-loop.V15 This and probably other positional anomalies are most clearly seen by echocardiographic and angiographic study and may be entirely overlooked by autopsy studies. Positional interrelations are not basic pathologic entities, but rotational anomalies producing variations of the four basic hearts.

The possible positions of the origins of the great arteries are nearly infinite around the 360 degrees of a circle but may be simplified as (1) normal, with aorta to the right (in visceroatrial situs solitus) or left (in inversus) and somewhat posterior to the pulmonary artery; (2) aorta anterior to the pulmonary artery, either directly or somewhat to the right (D-malpositionV12); (3) aorta to the left of the pulmonary artery (L-malposition); and (4) aorta posterior to the pulmonary artery. Normally, the great arteries tend to cross rather than run parallel. In contrast, when the great arteries are malposed, their first portions are usually parallel.D5

As indicated, these are all positional arterial abnormalities and are not basic parts of a malformation. However, certain probabilities exist. For example, the inflow portion of the right ventricle is usually on the side of the aortic origin.

#### Atrioventricular Flow Pathways

In normal hearts, AV flow pathways are more or less parallel. In cases of crisscross AV flow pathways, they cross over each other. The term *crisscross hearts* was introduced by Ando and colleaguesA16 and Anderson and colleaguesA15 in 1974, but the condition had been described earlier by Lev and Rowlatt in 1961.L7

The word *crisscross* has led to confusion and controversy. One point of view is that in some abnormal hearts, the pathways cross when viewed on cineangiography. Another point of view is that this is an illusion.V14 In any event, *crisscross* has no implications with regard to internal ventricular architecture or AV connections. The crisscross of the flow pathways is produced by positional abnormalities of the ventricles (often a superior/inferior position). Hypoplasia of the inflow or sinus of the right ventricle often contributes to crisscross. In most cases of crisscross, there is ventriculoarterial discordant connections and either discordant ventriculoarterial connections or double outlet right ventricle.

#### Defects and Abnormalities

Defects involving cardiac septa, chambers, and valves occur as more or less isolated anomalies, but are more common when connection and rotational anomalies exist. Such defects must be described separately for each heart, along with segmental situs, connections, and positions of the heart. Possible defects include VSD, atrial septal defect, AV septal defect, anomalous systemic and pulmonary venous connections, congenital valvar and subvalvar lesions, straddling AV valves, and abnormalities of septal morphology, including infundibular (conal) development.

#### Conventional Diagnoses

As a summarizing convenience, certain old and widely used phrases that are in themselves not anatomically specific but well understood by surgeons continue to be useful. In each instance, morphology denoted by a given phrase must be defined, in part because others may use the same phrase (e.g., transposition of the great arteries) differently. Such phrases include AV canal (see Chapter 34), tetralogy of Fallot (see Chapter 38), Taussig-Bing heart (see Chapter 53), complete transposition of the great arteries (see Chapter 53), double outlet ventricle (see Chapters 53 and 54), corrected transposition of the great arteries (see Chapter 55), isolated ventricular inversion (see Chapter 55), and anatomically corrected malposition of the great arteries (see Chapter 57). In the interest of readability, the text does not use quotation marks for these phrases; once defined they are used primarily for convenience.

#### Symbolic Convention of Van Praagh

Van Praagh's symbolic convention for the heart—for example, S,D,D heart—is widely used and a convenient and concise way of expressing certain anatomic features and relations. The first symbol refers to situs (isomerism) of thoracic viscera and atria (S for solitus, I for inversus). The second symbol indicates situs (isomerism) of the ventricles in terms of D-loop and L-loop (see "Situs of the Ventricles"). When taken with the first symbol, it is of fundamental significance in designating which of the four basic hearts, or isomeric combinations, is present. The third symbol refers to position of the aortic origin (D for right-sided, L for left-sided).

## Morphogenesis

Kirklin and Barratt-Boyes were reluctant to use terms with developmental implications, but our understanding of developmental events that lead on the one hand to normal anatomy and on the other to morphologic abnormalities has greatly expanded in recent years. It is now well understood that certain anomalies of the aorta can be traced to abnormalities of fetal remodeling of the embryonic aortic arches. Abnormalities of the aorta in bicuspid aortic valve appear traceable to neural crest cells that migrate late in heart development. B12,D7,F1,F2,K2

Van Praagh and colleagues present a unifying developmental theory for a large number of congenital heart

anomalies, including transposition of the great arteries, double outlet ventricles, tetralogy of Fallot, and VSD. These anomalies have in common variable remodeling (resorption) of the embryonic subarterial conus, particularly that under the developing aortic valve. V7 Insights such as this give rise to the idea, for example, that tetralogy of Fallot is fundamentally a monolesion from a developmental perspective.

Discoveries about the genetic basis for a number of cardiac abnormalities are also on the rise. How this knowledge will be instrumental in advancing cardiac surgery in particular and cardiothoracic medicine in general is uncertain at this time.

## Normal Pathway Dimensions from Autopsy Specimens

Rowlatt and colleagues provided extensive information about the dimensions (measured as circumference) of cardiac valves in formalin-fixed autopsy specimens from apparently normal children. R4 Because usually it is the diameter that is measured by echocardiography, angiography, and in the operating room, circumferences have been transformed to diameter, assuming that valve orifices are perfectly circular and using the equation:

$$Diameter = \frac{Circumference}{\pi}$$

These dimensions can also be expressed in terms of crosssectional area, using for the transformation the equation:

Area = 
$$\pi \frac{[Diameter]^2}{[2]}$$

Krovetz<sup>K9</sup> and Westaby and colleagues<sup>W2</sup> also made measurements from adult autopsy specimens that are compatible with those of Rowlatt and colleagues.<sup>R4</sup> These investigators added the information that as adults age, the aortic orifice gradually enlarges. Eckner and colleagues measured

pressure-fixed autopsy specimens and found dimensions similar to but slightly larger than those of Rowlatt and colleagues.E1

Scholz and colleagues also present extensive information on cardiac dimensions obtained in autopsy specimens.S6 Their findings and equations are generally similar to those of Rowlatt and colleagues, except they find that valve dimensions are best normalized to age and gender of the individual (rather than to body surface area [BSA]). These investigators believe that the predicted values from their regression equations are applicable to either fresh or fixed specimens and compare well with systolic anular dimensions obtained by imaging techniques in living subjects.

Most of the information in this book relating dimensions in patients to those obtained at autopsy uses equations derived from the work of Rowlatt and colleaguesR4 to compute the mean normal value and standard deviation based on the patient's BSA. This group expressed dimensions as circumference and BSA as cm2 . For use in this text, these have been transformed into diameter (assuming the cross-section was a perfect circle) and m2 . Diameters of cardiac valves for normal individuals are summarized in Table 1B-1.

Capps and colleaguesC1 analyzed 6801 fresh autopsied hearts for valve cryopreservation over the range of 0.18 to 3.55 m2 BSA. Mean indexed aortic valve area (*n* = 4636) was 2.02 ± 0.52 cm2 · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> . Mean diameters of each valve within ranges of BSA are given in Table 1B-2. Regression equations useful for predicting mean normal aortic and pulmonary valve diameters are given for males, females, and overall in Table 1B-3. This analysis ignores increase in valve size due to aging, which, though normal, may be considered a degenerative process.

## **1C Normal Pathway Dimensions from Cineangiography**

Using cineangiograms made in both anteroposterior and lateral projections in 42 normal children, Bini and colleagues measured cardiac and great artery dimensions at peak systole and in diastole (Bini M, Naftel DC, Blackstone EM: unpublished study, 1984). Median patient age was 12 months, range 2 days to 16 years; 25% were 2 months of age or younger, and 25% were 67 months of age or older; 24 were males and 18 were females. Consideration of adoption was usually the indication for study. Structures measured included midportion of the right ventricular infundibulum and junction of the right ventricle and pulmonary artery ("anulus"); distal end of the pulmonary trunk; origin, midportion, and immediately prebranching portion of the right pulmonary artery; origin and immediately prebranching portion of the left pulmonary artery; and aorta immediately downstream to the aortic valve, immediately before the takeoff of the brachiocephalic artery, and immediately above the diaphragm. By dividing the measured internal diameter of the cardiac catheter in the same frame by the known internal diameter of the catheter, a correction factor was calculated and used to correct the measured value for magnification.

To account for increased scatter of dimension data as body surface area (BSA) increased, logarithmic transformations were made of both dimension and body size. Individual regression equations (derived only when the number of observations was >10) were developed for each location and individually for systole and diastole in the anteroposterior and lateral projections. Mean normal diameter and standard deviation according to BSA were derived from these equations. A similar analysis of cineangiographic measurements was made earlier by Sievers and colleagues.S15 Both groups, working without knowledge of the other, found logarithmic transformation to best express the relations. Information for the equations is presented in Tables 1C-1 and 1C-2. The equations may be used to calculate the mean normal dimensions and standard deviations of the right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonary arteries for a specific BSA, for use in determining the *z* value of the dimension of a structure in a patient.

Dimensions of a part of the left ventricular tract and aorta were also determined by the Bini and Sievers groupsS15 (Bini M, Naftel DC, Blackstone EH: unpublished study, 1984) (see Tables 1C-1 and 1C-2). Clarkson and Brandt made measurements of the aorta in cineangiograms of normal infants and young children,C7 similar to those of Bini and colleagues.

Most of the information is this book relating patient dimensions to *z* values based on cineangiographic measurements uses regression equations derived from measurements made by Bini and colleagues, which are similar to those made by Sievers and colleaguesS15 (see Tables 1C-1 and 1C-2). Unfortunately, they did not measure the tricuspid valve. These equations are used to calculate normal mean values and standard deviations according to the patient's BSA; then the equation given in "Standardization of Dimensions" (see text) is used to calculate the *z* value. These equations and nomograms are for diameter. Some prefer to express the dimensions of the pulmonary arteries as cross-sectional area. Because of the logarithmic transformation used in the Bini and Sievers analyses, the *z* value for cross-sectional area is the same as that for diameter.

*a*Normal structure size (diameter or cross-sectional area) is calculated as Ln(size[diameter or cross-sectional area]) = scale factor + exponent · Ln(BSA), where body surface area (*BSA)* is expressed as square meters. Size can then be obtained by exponential transformation (*e* taken to the power of the logarithm). If diameter is used, coefficients are as shown in the table. If cross-sectional area is used, a circular lumen is assumed and the coefficients modified by multiplying the scale factor by 2 and subtracting 0.2415645 from the value obtained [Ln(π) − 2Ln(2)], by multiplying the exponent by 2, and by multiplying the standard deviation by 2. In all instances, *P* < .0001.

The *z* value (number of standard deviations a structure is above or below normal size) is calculated from the observed size as the logarithm of the observed size minus the calculated logarithm of normal size, divided by the standard deviation. Because the analysis uses the logarithmic transformation, *z* obtained using diameters is identical to one using cross-sectional area. All logarithms are natural logarithms.

*b*(Systolic + diastolic diameters)/2.

Key: *LPA,* Left pulmonary artery; *PA,* pulmonary artery; *r,* correlation coefficient; *RPA,* right pulmonary artery; *RV,* right ventricular; *SD,* standard deviation.

## **1D Normal Pathway Dimensions from Two-Dimensional Echocardiography**

Dimensions obtained by two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography are sometimes measured and expressed as length of anulus (without a commitment as to the shape of the orifice), sometimes as the shortest axis (anteroposterior) and the longest axis (lateral), and sometimes as cross-sectional area measured directly on the 2D echocardiographic image, without an assumption as to shape. Sometimes both the smallest and largest dimensions in a cardiac cycle are measured and expressed.

King and colleagues provided 2D echocardiographic measurements of the largest diameter of the mitral and tricuspid valves in apparently normal children.K5 These can be used for determining the normal mean values and standard deviations necessary for calculating the *z* values in individual patients.

Tei and colleagues provided similar measurements of the tricuspid valve.T3 Their mean value for area was 6.1 ± 0.9 cm2 · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> at the moment when the valve was largest and 4.1 ± 0.6 cm2 · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> when it was smallest; anular circumference was 7.8 ± 0.7 cm2 · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> and 5.2 ± 0.5 cm2 · m<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> , respectively. These values correspond well with the data presented by King and colleagues.

Riggs and colleaguesR2 presented information on mitral valve area and diameters in normal children and derived a regression equation normalizing these to body surface area (BSA). These values are similar to King'sK5 with regard to the anteroposterior dimensions, but are smaller in the lateral dimensions. Pollick and colleagues reported dimensions in normal children that were similar to those obtained by Riggs.P5

Daubeney and colleaguesD2 have provided a comprehensive catalog of cardiac structural dimensions by 2D echocardiography in normal infants and children. Definition of each dimension and the 2D echocardiographic view in which it was measured are given in Table 1D-1. For the most part, a regression equation was developed using BSA in the logarithmic transformation domain. The regression equation is:

> Ln Mean normal diameter mm Intercept Slope Ln BSA [ ( )] = + ⋅ ( )

where *mean normal diameter* is specific for BSA, *BSA* is expressed in square meters, and *Ln* is the natural logarithm. Values for the intercept and slope, as well as for the standard deviations (root mean square error), are presented in Table 1D-2. Values are the largest ones during the cardiac cycle, nearly always at end-diastole. The *z* value equation (see "Standardization of Dimensions" in text) can then be used to calculate the *z* value. More simply, a nomogram (Fig. 1D-1) may be used.

King and colleagues measured dimensions of mitral and tricuspid valves by 2D echocardiography.K5 Based on these data, regression equations were developed for mean normal diameter (logarithmic transformation) and BSA (logarithmic transformation) as shown in Table 1D-3. A digital nomogram is presented in Table 1D-4.

Habbal and Somerville measured dimensions of the left ventricular–aortic junction (aortic "anulus") in normal children by 2D echocardiography.H1 Their regression equation relating mean normal value to BSA is:

The form of the equation is Ln[mean normal value of structure] = intercept + slope  $\cdot$  Ln[BSA], where Ln is the natural logarithm and BSA is body surface area (m²). The structures are expressed in cm or cm². Value of z can be calculated as z = [Ln(measured structure) - Ln(mean normal value)]/SD.

Mean normal value = 
$$17.20[1 - \exp(-2.486 \cdot BSA)]$$

where *Ln* is the natural logarithm and *exp* is *e*, the base of the natural logarithms. The standard deviation is 0.09717 and was obtained in the log-log domain to stabilize variability. Therefore, as in the case of Bini and colleagues' analysis of cineangiographic data and Daubeney and colleagues' analysis of 2D echocardiography, <sup>D2</sup> the *z* value for cross-sectional area in a given patient is the same as for diameter, because of the logarithmic transformations used.

Using 2D echocardiography in children, Snider and colleagues measured cross-sectional dimensions of the right pulmonary artery and pulmonary trunk. S21 The regression equation is:

## **1E Comparison of Pathway Dimensions from Different Measurement Modalities**

#### Comparisons between Cineangiographic Dimensions and Those Obtained at Autopsy

The relationship of measurements obtained by imaging techniques to those obtained from autopsy specimens is arguable, but as was expressed earlier, this is not critical in studies relating dimensions to outcome when the *z* value is used. Differences relating to measurement modalities are nonetheless interesting.

Dimensions obtained from autopsy data are probably the most complete and reliable dimensions available. Even among postmortem direct measurements of dimensions, however, differences exist. As stated earlier, Scholz and colleagues found that dimensions are similar in both fresh and fixed specimens (except that when pressure fixation is used, the tricuspid valve and right heart dimensions are somewhat larger) and that dimensions in autopsy specimens from normal children are similar to those obtained by imaging techniques.S6 However, Alboliras and colleagues obtained data indicating that autopsy measurements should be multiplied by 1.04 to be comparable to cineangiographic measurements.A6 Bull and colleagues derived a multiplication factor of 1.4 for this purpose.B13

A comparison of the carefully performed cineangiographic measurements of Sievers and colleaguesS15 with those of Rowlatt and colleaguesR4 indicates that normal dimensions for the left ventricular–aortic junction were about 40% larger cineangiographically than at autopsy (Fig. 1E-1). A similar comparison of the dimensions of the right ventricular– pulmonary artery junction indicated that in subjects of less than about 1 m2 body surface area (BSA), cineangiographic measurements were about 17% larger, and that in larger subjects, cineangiographic measurements were 33% larger (Fig. 1E-2).

Sepehri and colleagues found that in diseased states in children, dimensions of the left ventricular–aortic junction obtained at autopsy were similar to those obtained from cineangiography, whereas those of the mitral valve obtained by cineangiography were approximately 16% larger than those obtained at autopsy.S8 These same investigators, using a perfusion fixation technique, found the tricuspid valve to be about 50% larger by cineangiography and the pulmonary valve about 14% larger, thereby confirming the statements of Scholz and colleagues.S6

#### Comparisons between Two-Dimensional Echocardiographic Dimensions and Those Obtained at Autopsy

An informal comparison between the echocardiographic measurements of the mitral valve by King and colleaguesK5 and those obtained at autopsy by Rowlatt and colleaguesR4 suggests that in subjects who have less than about 0.5 m2 BSA, the echocardiographic dimensions are about 33% larger (Fig. 1E-3). A similar comparison between the echocardiographic dimensions obtained by Riggs and colleaguesR2 and those obtained in autopsy specimens by the Rowlatt groupR4 indicates that dimensions were similar in small subjects, but the echocardiographically determined dimensions were about 20% larger in patients with BSAs greater than 1 m2 .

#### Other Comparisons

Formal comparisons of dimensions of cardiac structures in normal subjects obtained by angiography and echocardiography are missing. However, N.C. Nanda (personal communication, 1989) believes that in diseased states, echocardiographic dimensions are slightly larger than angiographic ones, probably because different bordering structures are used to define the dimension in these two different imaging techniques.

It is particularly difficult to compare dimensions derived from all three modalities. However, a comparison made for the tricuspid valve suggests that there is considerable difference in dimensions obtained using different measurement modalities (Fig. 1E-4).

## Comparison of Methods for Normalizing the Dimensions of Pulmonary Arteries

Four data sets were used to derive the interrelationships among three methods of expressing the dimensions of the right and left pulmonary arteries: (1) 35 normal children among the 42 studied by Bini and colleagues (see Appendix 1C), (2) 168 patients who had undergone repair of tetralogy

of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis, whose cineangiograms were made before any surgical procedure, \$11 (3) 215 patients with tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary atresia, \$13 and (4) 106 patients who had undergone the Fontan operation. F3

# Normal Ventricular Volume, Masses, and Dimensions from Different Measurement Modalities

Right and left ventricular dimensions and area, left ventricular wall thickness and mass, and septal thickness were measured by echocardiography (Table 1G-1).<sup>D2</sup> Regression equations are presented in Table 1G-2. Fig. 1G-1 shows the information presented in pairs of figures.

In addition to the measurements of Daubeney and colleagues, D2 the relation between right ventricular end-diastolic volume (RVEDV) and body surface area (BSA) was presented by Graham and colleagues, D2 Thilenius and Arcilla, Arcilla, Arcilla, Arcilla, Graham's equation and its use for z values is:

$$\begin{split} Ln(mean \ normal \ RVEDV, \ mL) \\ = 4.162 + 1.340 \cdot Ln(BSA, \ m^2) \end{split}$$

and

$$z = \frac{\text{Ln(observed RVEDV)} - \text{Ln(mean normal RVEDV)}}{0.2710}$$

where 0.2710 is the standard deviation and Ln is the natural logarithm.

The relation between right ventricular end-systolic volume (RVESV) and BSA was presented by Graham and colleagues, G2 Thilenius and Arcilla, T4 and Lange and colleagues. G3 Graham's equation and its use for z values is:

Ln(mean normal RVESV, mL)  
= 
$$3.692 + 1.284 \cdot \text{Ln(BSA, m}^2$$
)

and:

$$z = \frac{\text{Ln(observed RVEDV)} - \text{Ln(normal RVESV)}}{0.3211}$$

Mean normal value for right ventricular infundibular wall thickness from Rowlatt and colleagues<sup>R4</sup> is  $2.962 \pm 0.779$  mm and:

$$z = \frac{\text{Observed wall thickness} - 2.962}{0.779}$$

Mean normal value for right ventricular wall thickness in the area of the tricuspid valve is  $3.117 \pm 1.55$  mm and:

$$z = \frac{\text{Observed wall thickness} - 3.117}{1.155}$$

The relation between heart weight and BSA was studied by Kitzman and colleagues, <sup>K8</sup> Scholz and colleagues, <sup>S6</sup> and Rowlatt and colleagues (Table 1G-3). The regression equation in all cases is:

Van Praagh's symbolic representation may be combined with those of atrioventricular and ventricular arterial connections as shown in Figures 1H-1 through 1H-3. In Van Praagh's convention, the first letter (S or I) refers to atrial position (solitus or inversus), the second letter (D or L) to

ventricular loop, and the third letter to position of the origin of the aorta (recognized by its two coronary ostia) in relation to origin of the pulmonary trunk. V6 Arrangement of boxes and abbreviations is identical in all similar models presented.
