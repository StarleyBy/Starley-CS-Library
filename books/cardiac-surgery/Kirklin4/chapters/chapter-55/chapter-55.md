# Section I Congenitally Corrected Transposition of the Great Arteries

### **DEFINITION**

Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries is a congenital cardiac anomaly with ventriculoarterial discordant connection (transposition of the great arteries) and atrioventricular (AV) discordant connection, the right atrium connecting to left ventricle and left atrium connecting to right ventricle. Circulatory pathways are therefore in series. The condition occurs in atrial situs solitus and atrial situs inversus. Ventricles may lie in any position.

#### HISTORICAL NOTE

Rokitansky probably was first to describe a case of congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (CCTGA) in 1875. R6 After that, pathologists recognized the condition easily but considered it rare. L7 With advent of cardiac surgery, interest and knowledge expanded rapidly, and papers by Anderson and colleagues R from the University of Minnesota in 1957 and by Schiebler and colleagues from the Mayo Clinic in 1961 established the clinical syndromes associated with it.

Monckenberg (1913)<sup>M14</sup> and later Uher (1936)<sup>U1</sup> described the anterior position of the AV node, its usual location in CCTGA. In 1931, Walmsley<sup>W1</sup> recognized fundamental differences in cardiac structure in such hearts, including a different coronary arterial pattern and altered morphology in the central fibrous body and conduction system. In 1963, Lev and colleagues<sup>L2</sup> again described the anomalous position of the AV node and His bundle. Clinicians, however, remained unaware of these observations until Anderson and colleagues

Degree of elevation of great arteries above their respective ventricles corresponds to usual type of conal development.

confirmed the unusual position of the AV node and extended knowledge of the pathway of the bundle of His.  $^{\rm A12,A13}$ 

First repairs of a cardiac malformation associated with CCTGA were reported in 1957 by Anderson, Lillehei, and Lester from the University of Minnesota. As This repair and others reported from the Mayo Clinic 1914, M3 resulted in the morphologic right ventricle serving the systemic circulation. In 1990, Ilbawi and colleagues introduced the *double switch concept* in which the morphologic left ventricle serves the systemic circulation. In

### **MORPHOLOGY**

In atrial situs solitus, the most common arrangement of CCTGA is ventricular L-loop and L-malposition of the aorta (S,L,L; see "Symbolic Convention of Van Praagh" under Terminology and Classification of Heart Disease in Chapter 1) (Fig. 55-1). The left ventricle (LV) usually lies to the right side and right ventricle (RV) to the left side. The mitral valve then lies to the right side and tricuspid valve to the left side. The LV is usually slightly posterior and inferior to the RV. Mirror-image relationships pertain when there is atrial situs inversus (I,D,D). In rare cases, unusual twisting of the heart

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>1</sup>The adjectives *left* and *right* used to modify atrium or ventricle always mean *morphologically* right or left. Position of the chamber is referred to as *right-sided* or *left-sided*.

**Figure 55-2** Specimen of a heart with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries and atrial situs solitus viewed from below, showing outflow tract of right-sided left ventricle (LV). Septal leaflet of right-sided mitral valve (MV) has been swung to the right. A fibrous subvalvar membrane is visible *(large arrows)* and is continuous with anterior part of ventriculopulmonary junction ("anulus"). Part of the membrane was removed at operation, and fused, thickened pulmonary valve (PV) cusps were divided. Bundle of His is visible as a raised pale ridge crossing anterior wall of outflow tract just beneath valve anulus *(small arrows)*. This heart

along its long axis occurs, resulting in atypical topology *(crisscross heart)*. For example, in atrial situs solitus, there may be a discordant AV connection, but the ventricles are D-loop; similarly, discordant AV connection in atrial situs inversus will have L-loop ventricles.D12

# Ventricles

Usually there is fibrous continuity in the right-sided LV between the right-sided mitral and pulmonary valves and a well-developed left-sided RV infundibulum separating leftsided tricuspid and aortic valves. However, rare cases have been described with bilateral conus or bilaterally deficient conus.V3

The LV outflow tract beneath the pulmonary valve lies between the septal (pulmonary) leaflet of the mitral valve on the right and muscular ventricular septum on the left (Fig. 55-2). In its anterior part, there is often a prominent recess.A13 Ventricular outflow tracts do not cross, and ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk are parallel.

In atrial situs solitus, the apex of the heart is usually to the left and is formed by the RV. Dextrocardia exists in about 25% of cases, and occasionally mesocardia.C2 In atrial situs inversus, there is nearly always dextrocardia.

Other bizarre rotational anomalies occasionally occur in this and other hearts with AV discordant connections (see Morphology in Section II later in this chapter).

### Pulmonary Outflow Tract

The pulmonary valve lies in a transverse plane and arises from the right-sided LV in a wedged position between the mitral and tricuspid valves. Wedging of the pulmonary valve is said

had <sup>a</sup> large inlet septal ventricular septal defect (not shown). **Figure 55-3** Specimen of <sup>a</sup> heart with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries with opened right-sided left ventricle (LV) and pulmonary trunk (PT). Exposed ventricular septal surface is smooth and has fine apical trabeculations. There is a moderate-sized aneurysm of the membranous ventricular septum (MS) bulging into left ventricular outflow tract, associated with an infundibular ventricular septal defect (D). There is pulmonary (PV)– mitral valve (MV) fibrous continuity, the pulmonary cusp reaching to dashed line.

to be more marked in corrected than in complete transposition (see Morphology in Chapter 52) and more marked than that of the aorta in the normal heartL7 (see Chapter 1). The pulmonary valve lies to the right and posterior to the aortic valve. Axis of the AV valves is partway between transverse and sagittal planes as in the normal heart.

The long axis of pulmonary outflow from the right-sided LV is obliquely orientedA14 and potentially restrictive, particularly when there is LV hypertrophy. Obstruction is organic in about half the hearts,A6,A14 and in at least 25% it is hemodynamically important.L7

Pulmonary valve cusps may be thickened and fused or occasionally bicuspid or unicuspid. When valve stenosis is present, the pulmonary trunk may be narrowed by valve tethering, as in tetralogy of Fallot (see "Pulmonary Valve" under Morphology in Section I of Chapter 38). There may be pulmonary atresia with or without confluence between right and left pulmonary arteries. There may be subvalvar narrowing due either to a membrane that is adherent on its right (laterally) with the right-sided anterior mitral leaflet (see Fig. 55-2) or to an aneurysmal bulging of the membranous septum into the posterior part of the outflow tract with or without a ventricular septal defect (VSD)A6,K12 (Fig. 55-3). Less severe obstruction is usually due to fibrous tags (valvar excrescences) attached to the LV–pulmonary trunk junction, membranous septum, or right-sided mitral valve or due to valvar excrescences projecting through a VSD from the leftsided tricuspid valve leaflet.L4,W6 In about 1% of cases, pulmonary atresia is associated with arborization abnormalities of the branch pulmonary arteries and presence of major aortopulmonary collateral arteries.

### Atrial Septum

Atrial and ventricular septa are malaligned except where pulmonary, mitral, and tricuspid valves lie in close proximity and are joined by the right fibrous trigone. Elsewhere, atrial septal attachment to the fibrous skeleton of the heart is moved to the right of ventricular septal attachment.A13,B5 These alignment differences are usually severe enough in hearts with atrial situs solitus to prevent the normally positioned (regular) AV node (known as *posterior, inferior,* or *lateral node*) from reaching the underlying ventricular septum.

### Mitral Valve

The right-sided mitral valve lies at the entrance to the rightsided LV. Because of the wedged position of the pulmonary valve, the mitral anulus extends anterior to the pulmonary anulus so that the pulmonary valve is tucked beneath (to the left of) the septal mitral valve leaflet (see Fig. 55-2). The mitral valve is rotated so that its usual septal leaflet, which is in fibrous continuity with the pulmonary valve and can therefore be called the *pulmonary leaflet,* is posterior and its mural leaflet anterior (see Fig. 55-3). The smaller papillary muscle arises from the anterolateral free wall of the ventricle, where it can be damaged by left ventriculotomy. Its position is frequently marked by direct coronary artery branches crossing the front of the LV from the anterior descending coronary artery.A6 The larger papillary muscle arises from the posterolateral LV free wall. Mitral valve abnormalities are common, having been found in 55% of an autopsy seriesG2 (Fig. 55-4).

### Aortic Valve

The aortic valve, usually normal, is over the RV infundibulum, and it and the aorta are usually in a leftward and anterior position (S,L,L). Occasionally the aorta lies to the right and anterior to the pulmonary artery (S,L,D), associated with infundibular rotation in this direction.A6 In atrial situs inversus, the aorta is virtually always to the right (I,D,D).

Subaortic obstruction rarely occurs in the left-sided RV outflow tract.

### Tricuspid Valve

The left-sided tricuspid valve lies at the entrance to the leftsided RV, which has usual coarse trabeculations, a trabecula septomarginalis (septal band), and an infundibular septum. The valve is positioned almost in a sagittal plane and has the usual three leaflets but with the septal leaflet more medial and anterior than normal. According to some, it is nearly always structurally abnormal (90% of cases according to Allwork et al.A6). Others report fewer structural abnormalities, ranging from 23% to 43%.A1,H8 In most instances, there is leaflet dysplasia with abnormal thickened chordal attachments of the septal and posterior leaflets,B7,B18 and in a

minority there is a true Ebstein anomaly with downward displacement of origins of septal and posterior leaflets. Ebstein anomaly often differs from that in a heart with normal connections in three respectsA7:

- The anterior leaflet is normal in size rather than large and sail-like.
- The anulus is not dilated.
- The RV sinus is not enlarged.

In about 30% of hearts, morphologic changes make the tricuspid valve regurgitant or, rarely, stenotic. There may be a thinned, dilated atrialized portion of the RVA7,L7 with a variable degree of hypoplasia.E3

# Atrioventricular Node and Bundle of His

The AV node and bundle of His in CCTGA (and in most, if not all, hearts with atrial situs solitus and AV discordant connection) differ from normal.B10 Although a regular (posterior) AV node is present in front of the coronary sinus ostium in the apex of the triangle of Koch, the penetrating bundle of His usually does not extend from it because of septal malalignment. In exceptions in which the regular (posterior) AV node gives rise to the penetrating bundle, septal malalignment is mild. Degree of septal malalignment is influenced by size of the pulmonary trunk. Thus, presence of either pulmonary atresia or severe pulmonary stenosis results in less septal malalignment and an increased chance that the posterior AV node will align with the penetrating bundle.A10,H9

In contrast, in atrial situs inversus, the penetrating bundle of His most commonly extends from the regular (posterior) node.D5,M3,T5,W5 The bundle of His arising from the regular AV node then lies adjacent to the posteroinferior margin of the VSD.D5 An anterior AV node is generally also present but without a connection to a bundle of His. It has been suggested that in those cases of situs inversus in which pulmonary atresia or severe pulmonary stenosis has been present and the conduction system studied, there was only a minor degree of septal malalignment; therefore, this biased case selection may be the reason the penetrating bundle is said to "always" arise from the regular AV node in atrial situs inversus.A10 Indeed, there are many exceptions to the rule that the AV node and penetrating bundle are abnormal in situs solitus CCTGA and normal in situs inversus CCTGA.S8

In situs solitus, the second anterior (superior) node is located adjacent to the right AV orifice beneath the ostium of the right atrial appendage at its junction with the anterior atrial wall where the anterior horn of the limbus of the atrial septum joins the AV anulus (see Fig. 55-4). It is from this node that the penetrating bundle of His most commonly arises. Immediately beneath the node is the right fibrous trigone through which the penetrating bundle passes to lie immediately inferior (caudad) to the pulmonary anulus in the anterior LV free wall (see Fig. 55-2). It then passes over the anulus and descends away from it onto the anterior part of the infundibular septum.A12,A13 The bundle descends for some distance before branching, lying between membranous and muscular portions of the septum. It is subendocardial in position and frequently visible as a pale ridge of tissue (see Fig. 55-2). A cordlike right branch penetrates across the crest of the muscular septum to reach the left-sided RV septal surface near the origin of the papillary muscle of the conus and passes downward on the surface of the septal band to reach the moderator band. The sheetlike left bundle branch continues downward on the LV septal surface from the branching bundle. Occasionally, penetrating bundles pass from both regular and anterior AV nodes to form a sling of conducting tissue surrounding the pulmonary valve orifice.A13,B9,S14

The encircling portion of the AV bundle is prone to fibrosis in older people,A13 a feature that may explain spontaneous occurrence of complete heart block. Occasionally, when there is congenital complete heart block, anatomic discontinuity has been demonstrated between the node and either the bundle of HisB11,L2 or a sling of conduction tissue in the ventricular septum.B12,W3 In cases with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, accessory pathways are present (see Section III in Chapter 16).B12,S14

### Ventricular Septum

In the absence of positional anomalies, most of the muscular sinus septum lies in a sagittal plane and is therefore profiled in the anteroposterior view (rather than left anterior oblique) on cineangiography.L7 However, the left-sided RV cavity is circular in cross-section, and the lower-pressure LV wraps around it.

Septal malalignment and separation result in enlargement of the membranous septum and filling of the gap between atrial, ventricular, and infundibular septa. The degree of septal malalignment is thought to be influenced by size of the pulmonary trunk.A10,H9 The AV part of the membranous septum lies between left atrium and LV (rather than right atrium and LV as in the normal heart), and its interventricular portion lies beneath the posterior part of the pulmonary anulus. An aneurysm of this portion of the septum is common with or without a VSD (see Fig. 55-3) and can be a cause of LV outflow tract obstruction.A6,A7,K12 When a VSD is present, the aneurysm lies along its superior margin.

# Ventricular Septal Defect

VSD is the most common coexisting anomaly and is present in about 80% of hearts.A6 Usually it is large, subpulmonary, and associated with virtual absence of the membranous septum (infundibulum). The pulmonary valve commonly overrides the VSD to arise in part from the left-sided RV. As viewed from the right (LV) side (Fig. 55-5), the VSD is bounded superiorly by the pulmonary anulus or pulmonary valve itself, depending on degree of overriding. There may be membranous septal remnants along this margin (see Fig. 55-3). Posteriorly, it is bounded by that part of the rightsided mitral anulus from which the septal leaflet arises, and anteriorly and inferiorly by infundibular and muscular interventricular septa, respectively. Its posteroinferior margin may extend to the mitral anulus with a zone of mitral-pulmonarytricuspid fibrous continuity. It is frequently narrowed or nearly closed by an aneurysm of the membranous septum (see Fig. 55-3) or valvar excrescences from the left-sided tricuspid valve (see Section IV in Chapter 38).A6

Viewed from the RV (left) side, this perimembranous VSD lies, as usual, within the Y of the trabecula septomarginalis and beneath the infundibular septum; the VSD, in other words, is infundibular in type and is often accompanied by some malalignment of the infundibular septum that

contributes to subpulmonary stenosis. The bundle of His courses along its anterior margin on the LV (right) side in a subendocardial position and bifurcates at its anteroinferior angle with the right bundle branch crossing this angle of the defect to reach the RV.

In about 10% of cases (more often in Japanese patients),O2 the VSD lies within the infundibular septum; when it completely replaces it, it is immediately below both great arteries (doubly committed, juxta-arterial) (Fig. 55-6). Uncommonly, it is muscular, lying in the sinus (trabecular) septum. A large, typical inlet septal VSD may uncommonly occur. Also, there may be multiple VSDs.

### Coronary Arteries

Coronary arteries demonstrate anatomy appropriate to their ventricles. Thus, the right-sided left coronary artery (coronary artery to right-sided LV) with its left anterior descending and circumflex branches supplies the LV, and the right coronary artery and its conal and posterior descending branches supplies the RV. Aortic origins are, however, peculiar to the malformation. The anterior sinus is the noncoronary one; the right-sided left coronary artery arises from the right posterior sinus and passes directly in front of the pulmonary valve to divide into left anterior descending and circumflex branches, the latter passing in front of the right atrial appendage in the AV groove; the left-sided right coronary artery arises from the left posterior sinus and runs in the AV groove and in front of the left atrial appendage, terminating posteriorly as the posterior descending artery. Lev and Rowlatt used the terms "right sided" and "left sided" to describe these vessels.L3 The most common major variation from this arrangement is for a single coronary artery to arise from the right sinus and divide into right and left main branches; this occurs in less than 10% of cases. Other minor variations occur.D1,M7

### Other Associated Anomalies

Only 1% to 2% of hearts with CCTGA have no coexisting anomalies.A6,A16,L7 Coexisting anomalies other than those described in the preceding text include a supravalvar left atrial ring, which may be a cause of left-sided (tricuspid) valve stenosis,A6 and coarctation of the aorta in association with a VSD.C8,M4 Coarctation may be particularly common when severe forms of Ebstein anomaly are present.C4 A patent ductus arteriosus is sometimes present, as is a true atrial septal defect in about 20% of cases.

Overriding or straddling of AV valves is more common when there are positional anomalies, as is hypoplasia of one or other ventricle.E3 The left-sided tricuspid valve may override or straddle a VSD,L5 which is at times associated with hypoplasia of the left-sided RV and at times with superiorinferior ventricles (see "Positional Anomalies" under Ventricular Position and Rotation in Section II of this chapter and "Cardiac and Arterial Positions" under Terminology and Classification of Heart Disease in Chapter 1). The left-sided tricuspid valve straddles the posterior part of the ventricular septum, which is then prevented from reaching the crux, and the conduction tissue passes anterior to the pulmonary anulus.M11 More rarely, the right-sided mitral valve may behave similarly (as it does at times in AV discordant connection with double outlet right ventricle [see Section II]); invariably this is associated with LV hypoplasia and superiorinferior ventricles.B6,S9 The mitral valve straddles the anterior part of the septum so that it does not extend to the crux, and a regular posterior node only may be present, with the bundle passing posterior to the pulmonary anulus.B6

# CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

Clinical features depend solely on the presence and combination of associated cardiovascular lesions. The rare patient with no associated lesions will be asymptomatic for years or decades and may present with left-sided RV failure after several decades or more. More commonly, clinical features are dominated by a large VSD associated with some restriction of

**Figure 55-7** Cumulative distribution of age at operation of patients with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (CCTGA) and ventricular septal defect (VSD) with or without pulmonary stenosis, compared with patients with concordant atrioventricular (AV) connection having isolated VSD repair. Dashed lines enclose 70% confidence limits. Note that only 67% of those with isolated VSD are without operation by age 1 year, whereas 88% of those with CCTGA remain without operation by that age. (Data regarding patients with VSD and CCTGA are from the UAB experience, 1967-1983; depiction of patients with "isolated VSD" [i.e., VSD in hearts with concordant AV connection] is from Rizzoli and colleagues.R4)

pulmonary blood flow attributable to morphology of the subpulmonary LV outflow tract. Therefore, symptoms from sequelae of large pulmonary blood flow occur in only about 30% of casesF5 (Fig. 55-7), in contrast to an isolated large VSD (see "Clinical Features and Diagnostic Criteria" in Section I of Chapter 35).

It is uncommon for pulmonary stenosis to be severe enough to require a shunting procedure in the first year of life. Friedberg and Nadas found only 30% of their patients presented in the first year of life with cyanosis, although cyanosis was present at some time during the course of the disease in two thirds of patients.F5

Most often, presentation is in childhood or in the second decade because of growth failure and exercise intolerance from a left-to-right shunt or, if there is important pulmonary stenosis, mild or moderate cyanosis or effort intolerance. Left-sided tricuspid valve regurgitation may complicate the other anomalies present or occur as an isolated finding. Regurgitation seems to worsen with time, and therefore patients with it occasionally present first in the third, fourth, or fifth decade of life; however, occasionally a neonate or infant will present in heart failure with severe left-sided tricuspid valve regurgitation.

The clinical feature bringing some patients to medical attention is bradycardia from congenitally complete heart block (present from birth or soon after), which occurs in 10% to 30% of cases.C1,F5,L2 Complete heart block at times is episodic and induced temporarily by cardiac catheterization, anesthesia, exercise, or sternotomy.S4 First- or second-degree heart block is found in an additional 20% to 30% of patients,B14,S4 many of whom earlier had normal AV conduction,F5 and this degree of heart block may be a prelude to developing complete heart block (see Natural History later in this section). Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, either type A or B, coexists occasionally (see Section III in Chapter 16).B11,G7,S4,S13

Physical findings are generally not diagnostic,F5 but finding a loud second heart sound at the second left intercostal space is suggestive because it may represent closure of the leftward and anterior aortic valve.H4,S4

Although chest radiography may suggest that a congenital cardiac malformation has AV discordant connection by an ascending aortic shadow appearing along the left upper cardiac silhouette, this is not diagnostic because there are many other anomalies with the aorta in L-malposition (see Clinical Features and Diagnostic Criteria in Chapter 57). Electrocardiography (ECG) may suggest a correct diagnosis when there is reversal of precordial Q-wave pattern with deep Q waves in leads V2 and aVR, and QS complexes in leads V3 and aVF in right precordial leads. Congenital or developing complete heart block is also suggestive of CCTGA.L7

Echocardiography provides accurate diagnosis of CCTGA.A19,H1,S13 When spatial orientation of the ventricular septum is abnormal, the left-sided AV valve inserts more toward the apex than the right-sided one and has direct chordal attachments to the inlet septum. There is also continuity between the right-sided AV valve and the posterior (pulmonary) semilunar valve.L7 Additional findings of transposed great arteries with aorta anterior and to the left, and a left-sided ventricle containing a coarsely trabeculated endocardial surface and moderator band, help confirm the diagnosis (Fig. 55-8). Presence of VSDs, valve function, and venous connections can all be defined.

Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide excellent delineation of the morphology of CCTGAC5,K1 (Fig. 55-9), but in neonates and infants, these imaging modalities add little to echocardiography with respect to making the diagnosis and identifying associated cardiac anomalies. These additional studies can be extremely helpful, however, in providing additional information that may be important in complex management decisions that eventually must be made for many of these patients. MRI can be particularly helpful in quantitating ventricular volumes and valve regurgitant fraction (Fig. 55-10). It can also be helpful in quantitating LV mass and determining the ventricular septal position in cases being evaluated for a double switch procedure (Fig. 55-11). Volume-rendered CT imaging is capable of showing excellent spatial resolution of the coronary arteries and is particularly helpful in demonstrating the interrelationships between the coronary arteries and adjacent structures (Fig. 55-12).

Cardiac catheterization and biplane cineangiography provide confirmatory diagnostic data (Fig. 55-13). Pressure and flows are measured to quantify severity of pulmonary stenosis and any intracardiac shunt. Angiographic views must profile the ventricular septum and establish morphology of various chambers and sites of systemic and pulmonary venous connection and, thus, cardiac connections present. They can define location and number of VSDs, nature of the pulmonary stenosis and of tricuspid valve function, and other associated anomalies.B16,L7,S10 Catheterization is rarely used in modern practice to define morphology, because echocardiography, CT, and MRI adequately provide these details in essentially all cases. Catheterization is indispensable if pulmonary vascular resistance, shunt fractions, or ventricular end-diastolic pressure is required for decision making.

### **NATURAL HISTORY**

### Heart Block

About 5% to 10% of infants with CCTGA or other types of AV discordant connection (see Section II) have complete heart block at birth. CL,F5,L2 This proportion slowly increases at about 2% per year to reach a prevalence of about 10% to 15% by adolescence and 30% by adulthood. H13 Block may be in the AV node or in single or multiple sites more distally. In some infants born with complete heart block, bundle of His

potentials are not recordable, <sup>G4</sup> and morphologic evidence of a connection between an AV node and more distal parts of the His bundle cannot be found.

At least 40% to 50% of patients with AV discordant connection are born with first- or second-degree AV block. <sup>B14</sup> As time passes, prolongation of the PR interval often develops, even in those with originally normal intervals. <sup>F5</sup> Thus, Gillette and colleagues <sup>G4</sup> found normal AV conduction at age 6 to 7 years in only 38% (CL 29%-47%) of 40 patients with CCTGA. Progressive prolonging of the PR interval may eventuate in

episodic or permanent complete heart block.S4 However, about 40% of patients with AV discordant connection retain normal PR intervals and QRS durations throughout their lives.

### Ventricular Function

General outlines of the truth about systemic (morphologic right) and pulmonary (morphologic left) ventricular function are gradually becoming apparent, although many of the details are missing (see Special Situations and Controversies later in this section). Ventricular function is not normal but is sufficiently good that a large proportion of patients maintain essentially normal functional status well into adult life.D7,K5 In 12 adults with CCTGA, many with associated anomalies, followed longitudinally for 10 years, ventricular ejection fraction did not change.D7 However, systemic ventricular function (function of the RV) tends to gradually deteriorate during and after the second decade of lifeG6; isolated reports of survival into the seventh, eighth, and ninth decades do exist.M13,R5,S2

In the unusual circumstance of CCTGA without other cardiac anomalies, an adequate cardiac index is usually sustained during exercise,P3 but increase in heart rate accounts for this, and stroke volume is not increased. Response of the systemic (right) ventricular ejection fraction to exercise is variable, the ejection fraction increasing in some patientsB8 but not in others.P1,P3 Systemic (right) ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes also behave variably during exercise, but on the average do not change, whereas in normal individuals, systemic (left) ventricular end-systolic volume decreases with exercise.P3

Pulmonary (left) ventricular ejection fraction usually increases with exercise in patients with CCTGA without other cardiac anomalies.P3 Other indices do not change systematically with exercise, as is also the case in normal individuals.

Etiology of ventricular dysfunction is poorly understood. Myocardial perfusion plays a role. Perfusion defects at rest are common in the morphologic RV in CCTGA, and their extent correlates inversely with ejection fraction.E4,H6,H7

Women of childbearing age seem to tolerate pregnancy and delivery moderately well, with some increased risk of maternal complications and fetal loss.C7,T4

# Effect of Coexisting Cardiac Anomalies

Because of the high prevalence of coexisting cardiac anomalies, survival free from cardiac intervention is less than 30% at 36 months after birth.W2 Even without coexisting anomalies, the likelihood of developing heart block and reduced systemic (right) ventricular function probably adversely affects natural history; coexisting cardiac anomalies further affect it. A multicenter study involving 182 patients confirms these points: By age 45 years, 25% of patients without coexisting anomalies developed heart failure, and 67% of those with associated anomalies did.G5 Other studies link heart failure in this setting to increased risk of death.P4

The natural history of CCTGA patients whose only coexisting lesion is a large VSD tends to be slightly better than that of patients with isolated large VSDs (see Fig. 55-7); this may be because their VSDs are smaller than in patients presenting with isolated VSDs. (This difference was not apparent in the report of Friedberg and Nadas,F5 possibly related to their inclusion of patients with univentricular AV connection [single ventricle] in their study.) Chronic symptoms of effort intolerance and growth failure are common in patients with CCTGA in the first 2 decades of life, but death is infrequent. Although estimates of survival are unavailable, presumably death from chronic heart failure occurs with increasing frequency during the third, fourth, and fifth decades of life.

When important pulmonary stenosis coexists with VSD, cyanosis appears in early life, and the natural history may be similar to that of tetralogy of Fallot (see Natural History under Section I of Chapter 38). However, compared with tetralogy of Fallot, lack of a subpulmonic infundibulum in CCTGA may substantially alter the likelihood of a dynamic muscular component of pulmonary obstruction.

The natural history of the left AV valve in patients with CCTGA and other types of AV discordant connection is unclear. Occasionally the valve may be importantly regurgitant from early in life, but more commonly there is little or no regurgitation initially, and then its prevalence and magnitude increase progressively during the second through fifth decades. The exception is Ebstein anomaly of the left-sided tricuspid valve, when regurgitation is commonly present from birth.

In atrial situs inversus, VSD and pulmonary stenosis are more likely to be present than in atrial situs solitus. However, there is less likelihood of developing spontaneous complete heart block, because of the considerably higher prevalence of the penetrating bundle connecting to a normally positioned AV node.A18

# TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

# Repair of Coexisting Ventricular Septal Defect

Preparations for operation, median sternotomy, and placing pericardial stay sutures are as usual (see "Preparation for Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2). Placing purse-string sutures for aortic cannulation and cannulation itself are more difficult than usual because of aortic L-malposition. These procedures are facilitated by grasping aortic adventitia with one or two small curved hemostats and retracting them inferiorly and rightward. Usual purse-string sutures are placed for aortic cannulation and the cardioplegic catheter; caval tapes and purse-string sutures are also placed. In atrial situs solitus and dextrocardia, right atrium and venae cavae are hidden behind the ventricle, making cannulation difficult, although difficulty of direct caval cannulation is not increased.

# *Through Right-Sided Mitral Valve*

Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is established in the usual manner, as are cardioplegia and controlled reperfusion (see "Cold Cardioplegia, Controlled Aortic Root Reperfusion, and [When Needed] Warm Cardioplegic Induction" in Chapter 3). The right atrium is opened through an oblique incision (Fig. 55-14). A pump-oxygenator sump sucker is introduced through the right superior pulmonary vein across the left-sided AV valve into the left-sided ventricular chamber.

The VSD is examined through the right-sided mitral valve (Fig. 55-15, *A*). Although it does not permit quite as free access to the interior of the ventricle as the normal right-sided tricuspid valve, in most cases the VSD can be repaired through the intact mitral valve. When exposure is suboptimal, an incision is made in the base of the mitral valve septal leaflet near the superior commissure and through the base of the

Dashed line on free wall of right atrium (RA) shows site of incision used for VSD closure. Note superior placement of atrioventricular (AV) node, in contrast to the normal heart in which the AV node is located more inferiorly within the triangle of Koch in proximity to coronary sinus. Penetrating bundle of His passes anterior to pulmonary valve anulus, and branching bundles are in proximity to superior and anterior edges of VSD when viewed through the right-sided mitral valve. Left branching bundle of His is shown here on left ventricular side of septum. The mitral valve that guards the opening between right atrium and morphologic left ventricle (MLV) is not shown in this figure so that relationships among conduction system, pulmonary valve anulus, and VSD can be illustrated more clearly. Key: *MRV,* morphologic right ventricle.

**Figure 55-15** Repair of ventricular septal defect (VSD) in patient with situs solitus, congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, and VSD. **A,** Close-up view of VSD through intact mitral valve. Intracardiac exposure is gained through a right atrial incision as shown in Fig. 55-14. Exposure of a typical conoventricular VSD is more difficult working through the mitral valve orifice compared with a similar defect in a patient with atrioventricular concordant connection working through tricuspid valve. However, VSD can be exposed and closed in most circumstances without incising the posterior leaflet. The retractor is used to move aside anterior aspect of mitral valve anulus and anterior valve leaflet. In this case, the VSD patch is sewn into place with a running monofilament nonabsorbable suture, beginning at the most anterior aspect of the rim of the VSD. To avoid injury to the conduction system, sutures must be placed on morphologic right ventricular side of VSD rim along its anterior and superior aspects. Here, a single felt pledget is positioned on morphologic right ventricular side of septum to initiate the suture line. Two dashed lines to left and right of pledget represent partial thickness suture placement on morphologic right ventricular side of defect along its anterior aspect. Branching bundle of His is shown coursing along anterior aspect of VSD. **B,** If VSD cannot be adequately exposed through the mitral valve orifice, it may be beneficial to incise the posterior mitral valve leaflet 1 to 2 mm from its anular attachment as shown by dashed lines. **C,** Incised posterior leaflet of mitral valve has been retracted anteriorly, allowing direct exposure of conoventricular VSD.

commissural tissue into the mural leaflet (Fig. 55-15, *B-C*). The technique is similar to that used occasionally for inlet septal VSD. Working through the aperture created, VSD repair can be accomplished nicely (Fig. 55-15, *D-E*). However, the alternative of repairing the VSD through the aorta should be considered when approach through the right atrium is not optimal (see text that follows).

Margins of the VSD are studied (see Fig. 55-15, *A* and *C*). Location of the anterior AV node and bundle of His arching over the subpulmonary outflow tract and passing anterior to the VSD are conceptualized (in fact, the bundle often can be seen as a thin, pale line as shown in Fig. 55-14). Electrophysiologic mapping is unnecessary. The left-sided tricuspid valve can usually be seen through the

![](_page_12_Figure_2.jpeg)

**D,** Completed VSD patch closure is shown in a case with the mitral valve posterior leaflet left intact. Note that patch is placed on morphologic right ventricular aspect of VSD rim along the anterior and superior components, and then on the edge, or if convenient, the left ventricular aspect of rim along the posterior and inferior aspects where conduction tissue is not of concern. The inset shows section through a plane perpendicular to ventricular septum, illustrating transition of VSD patch from right to left side in relation to the branching bundle of His. **E,** If incision of posterior leaflet of mitral valve is necessary, repair of the leaflet is performed using a fine running monofilament suture, attaching leaflet to anulus. **Figure 55-15, cont'd**

VSD, and some of its chordae often attach to the inferior VSD border.

VSD repair is made by sewing into place a properly sized patch of either glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium or double-velour knitted polyester, keeping sutures on the left (RV) side of the defect anterosuperiorly, anteriorly, and as much as possible inferiorly (see Fig. 55-15, *A* and *D*). Chordae from the left-sided tricuspid valve, often attached to the inferior edge of the VSD, limit this possibility inferiorly. Continuous polypropylene suture, ranging from 6-0 to 4-0 depending on the size of the patient, is used, or interrupted pledgeted mattress sutures when exposure is difficult because of overlying chordal structures. After VSD repair is complete, if a circumferential incision has been made in the mitral leaflets, this incision is closed with continuous polypropylene suture using previously placed fine stay sutures to keep the closure properly oriented so valve distortion is avoided (Fig. 55-15, *E*). If a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect is present, it is closed.

The subpulmonary (LV outflow) tract is examined. Unless the pulmonary valve itself is stenotic or valvar excrescences obstruct the subvalvar area, little can be done to improve the variable degree of narrowing usually present (see Results). Only placing an LV–pulmonary trunk valved extracardiac conduit provides good relief. However, if pulmonary blood flow has been large (>2.0 preoperatively), even a 50-mmHg gradient does not necessarily indicate need for a conduit. With elimination of left-to-right shunt by closing the large VSD, right-sided LV pressure usually decreases appreciably.

The usual de-airing procedures are accomplished (see "De-airing the Heart" in Section III of Chapter 2). The aortic clamp is removed, and the right atrial incision is closed with a continuous polypropylene suture. The remainder of the procedure, including placing temporary atrial and ventricular pacing wires, is carried out in the usual manner (see "Placing Epicardial Pacemaker Leads" later in this section and "Completing Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2).

### *Through Aorta*

An attractive alternative approach is closing the VSD through the aorta, which allows the patch to be sutured into place from the RV (left-sided) aspect of the septum.M5 Experience of Russo and colleagues suggests this may reduce the prevalence of perioperative complete heart block.R7 This approach is more attractive than that through the pulmonary trunk, which some advocate.O3

# *Through Left-Sided Tricuspid Valve*

When isolated dextrocardia complicates CCTGA and VSD, the VSD can be repaired through a left-sided incision in the usually large left-sided left atrium. Exposure through the leftsided tricuspid valve usually allows good exposure, and surgically induced heart block should be avoidable because suturing is all on the RV (left) side of the septum.F3

# Repair of Coexisting Ventricular Septal Defect and Pulmonary Stenosis

The main decision-making challenge is determining whether satisfactory repair can be accomplished without a valved extracardiac conduit. When the pulmonary valve is stenotic, it is approached through a pulmonary arteriotomy during moderately hypothermic CPB and cold cardioplegia, and valvotomy is performed as for isolated pulmonary valve stenosis (see Fig. 39-10 in Chapter 39). The pulmonary arteriotomy is best closed with a patch and continuous suture. Obstructing fibrous subvalvar tags are excised, bearing in mind the His bundle position (see Fig. 55-14). A subvalvar fibrous membrane can be excised with utmost care if it is at the anteroinferior angle. Aneurysm of the membranous ventricular septum is excised and the deficiency closed as part of VSD repair. If other excrescences are present, they are first examined to ensure they are not functioning parts of the AV valves or subvalvar mechanisms; then they are sharply resected.

Muscle must never be removed from the rightward (medial) aspect of the right-sided LV outflow tract or from the anterior part adjacent to the pulmonary anulus, because the His bundle lies there. Then Hegar dilators are used to measure the resulting orifice and the *z* value estimated (see "General Plan and Details of Repair Common to All Approaches" under Technique of Operation in Section I of Chapter 38). Valvotomy may be inadequate because of a bicuspid valve, supravalvar pulmonary trunk narrowing (tethering) at the level of commissural attachment, or (most commonly) a narrow subpulmonary LV outflow tract. However, if the *z* value is greater than −1, the pulmonary trunk is repaired, usual de-airing and other procedures carried out, and CPB discontinued.

Pressures are measured before removing the cannulae. Relationship between the postvalvotomy left-to-right ventricular pressure (PLV/RV) in the operating room and that the next morning and late postoperatively is not known. However, it has seemed reasonable not to revert to CPB and place a valved extracardiac conduit if PLV/RV in the operating room is less than about 0.85, considering that the right-sided ventricle and valve are a morphologic LV and mitral valve. On the other hand, pulmonary stenosis usually represents a fixed resistance, and the LV-to–pulmonary trunk gradient will increase with exercise.

A polyvinyl catheter is placed in the right-sided LV and, if possible, threaded into the pulmonary trunk. LV pressure is remeasured the next morning in the intensive care unit with this catheter, and if calculated PLV/RV is less than about 0.7, the patient is not returned to the operating room for placing a valved extracardiac conduit.

# *Placing Valved Extracardiac Conduit*

When pulmonary stenosis is so severe that the patient is cyanotic preoperatively, or when simple procedures to relieve the stenosis are unsatisfactory (see earlier) or postrepair PLV/RV is too high, a valved extracardiac conduit is used.E1 After VSD repair, working through the right atrium, a site is chosen for attaching the conduit to the right-sided LV by examining the LV interior through the mitral valve. A site is chosen on the anterior wall, but rather inferior and away from any papillary muscles and major coronary artery branches. Left ventriculotomy is then made. If there is reasonable flow across the native LV–pulmonary trunk outflow tract, it can be left intact, creating an end-to-side anastomosis of conduit to pulmonary trunk. This results in LV ejection via two routes: native tract and conduit. More commonly when a conduit is required, obstruction is severe; therefore the pulmonary trunk is transected at the valve level, the proximal stump oversewn, and the conduit connected end to end to the distal pulmonary trunk (Fig. 55-16).

**Figure 55-16** Standard repair of situs solitus congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, ventricular septal defect (VSD), and pulmonary stenosis. Repair of VSD proceeds as shown in Fig. 55-15. Placing valved conduit from morphologic left ventricle to pulmonary trunk is shown. Pulmonary trunk, lying to the right of and posterior to the aorta, has been transected and the proximal stump of the stenotic pulmonary valve oversewn at valve level with a two-layer running monofilament suture. Morphologic left ventriculotomy site is chosen before right atrium is closed following VSD repair in order to visualize internal papillary muscle structure prior to ventriculotomy. Typically the ventricle is incised and a limited excision of free wall is performed. Exact site of left ventriculotomy is chosen based on several considerations. Primarily, papillary muscle position and major epicardial coronary artery branches are judiciously avoided. The secondary consideration is to create the ventriculotomy at a site that keeps the proximal conduit away from the sternum as much as possible. Typically the conduit is positioned to right side of the midline and ascending aorta, as illustrated. Conduit is usually much longer than that required in tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia (see Section II of Chapter 38). A composite conduit is usually constructed using a distal valved allograft and a proximal polytetrafluoroethylene or polyester tube. Distal position of valved conduit component within the composite allows the valve to be positioned more posteriorly in mediastinum, thereby avoiding compression and distortion of valve with sternal closure.

Reconstruction can be accomplished in a number of ways. An allograft-valved conduit has previously been prepared by extending it proximally with a woven polyester tube (see Fig. 55-16). Alternatively, proximal extension may be with an aortic allograft, or the allograft aortic valve and ascending aorta may be left long distally, and proximal anastomosis augmented with a pericardial hood (see "Placement of Valved Conduit" in Section II of Chapter 38). These extensions are particularly necessary in this situation because the conduit must be of sufficient length to prevent kinking, and the valve must lie away from the LV so that it is not distorted. Estimating length and lie of the conduit is important to avoid its compression by the sternum.

The conduit is trimmed to size, cutting the distal end square but leaving more of the ascending aorta beyond the aortic valve than in the case of tetralogy, because this facilitates a smooth conduit contour and limits length of the polyester extension. The proximal polyester end of the conduit is trimmed to make a cobra head, the distal allograft end anastomosed end to end to the distal pulmonary trunk, and the proximal polyester end anastomosed to the ventriculotomy. The conduit most commonly is placed to the right around the right atrium and atrial appendage (see Fig. 55-16), although extreme deviations in cardiac position may influence conduit position, occasionally making a left-sided placement appropriate. Aeba and colleagues describe placing the conduit from the apex of the LV to the pulmonary trunk to avoid the well-known problem of sternal compression.A2

# *Transanular Patch*

Doty and colleaguesD10 proposed using a posteriorly placed transanular patch across the pulmonary valve anulus in this situation. However, average gradient across the repair was 40 mmHg.

# Correction for Regurgitant Left-Sided Tricuspid Valve

When important left-sided tricuspid valve regurgitation coexists, repair and anuloplasty are only occasionally successful but should be attempted if it seems feasible.W6 If replacement is required, the same considerations apply to the replacement device as in ordinary left-sided mitral valve replacement (see "Choice of Device for Valve Replacement" in Section I of Chapter 11). Valve replacement is the same as for a left-sided mitral valve, including choice of venous cannulae and approach through the right side of the left atrium (see "Mitral Valve Replacement" in Section I of Chapter 11 and Fig. 11-19). The replacement device is either sewn in with interrupted pledgeted mattress sutures or simple interrupted sutures. A continuous suture technique is not desirable when there is absence of a well-defined anulus in some areas, as may occur when there is downward displacement into the ventricle of some of the left-sided tricuspid valve leaflets, as in Ebstein anomaly.

### Double Switch Procedures

Because of concern over long-term fate of the morphologic RV and tricuspid valve in the systemic circulation, some suggest placing the morphologic LV and mitral valve into the systemic circulation. This requires switching both venous return and arterial outflow (double switch) by one of several procedures, all of which are technically substantially more complex than those already described. The double switch concept was originally suggested by Ilbawi and colleagues for patients with CCTGA, VSD, and pulmonary stenosis.I1 In this setting, the morphologic LV is connected to the aorta by creating an intraventricular baffle (which also closes the VSD); an extracardiac conduit is placed from morphologic RV to pulmonary trunk, and a Mustard or Senning intraatrial transposition of venous return is performed. The concept was subsequently applied to CCTGA without pulmonary stenosis, with or without VSD. In this setting, an arterial switch is performed to correct the ventriculoarterial discordant connection. (All of these reconstructive procedures used in combination in the double switch procedures are individually described in detail in Chapter 52.) Aortic translocation has also been used for selected cases of CCTGA with VSD and pulmonary stenosis.D2,H10,K14

If these procedures are being considered for patients without VSD in whom the morphologic LV is working at low pressure, the same considerations must be addressed as in simple transposition of the great arteries (TGA) with unprepared LV (see "Simple Transposition of the Great Arteries Presenting after Age 30 Days" under Indications for Operation in Chapter 52).

Both major double switch procedures are performed using a standard median sternotomy incision, CPB with moderate hypothermia using bicaval venous cannulation through purse-string sutures placed directly on the venae cavae, aortic cannulation at the base of the brachiocephalic artery, and venting of the systemic ventricle by way of a cannula introduced through the right upper pulmonary vein. Multiple doses of cold cardioplegic solution are used for these extensive procedures (see "Methods of Myocardial Management" under Neonates and Infants in Chapter 3). Individual components of the two major double switch procedures are as follows:

- 1. The *atrial baffle procedure,* which is performed exactly as for simple TGA (see "Mustard Technique" and "Senning Technique" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 52). It is not uncommon in CCTGA of both the S,L,L and the I,D,D types for cardiac positioning abnormalities such as mesocardia or apicocaval juxtaposition to be present. In these cases, the free wall of the systemic venous atrium is likely to be deficient, making the Mustard technique preferable to the Senning. Atrial baffle placement may be more difficult than in simple TGA, because the left-sided tricuspid valve is positioned much more posteriorly across the atrial septum in relation to the vena cavae.
- 2. For patients with VSD and pulmonary stenosis, the *morphologic LV–to-aortic intracardiac baffle procedure,* which is accomplished through a subaortic incision in the infundibulum of the morphologic RV as described under "Intraventricular Repair" in Chapter 52, for S,D,D transposition with VSD and pulmonary stenosis or atresia. The morphologic RV-to–pulmonary trunk conduit is placed as described under "Rastelli Operation" in Chapter 52. This procedure is shown in Fig. 55-17, *A* to *E*.
- 3. For patients without pulmonary stenosis, the *arterial switch procedure* is performed using the same techniques described under "Arterial Switch Operation" in Chapter 52 for simple TGA. If a VSD is present, it is closed as described earlier under "Repair of Coexisting Ventricular Septal Defect." This procedure is shown in Fig. 55-18, *A* to *D*.

### Double Switch Procedures Combined with Bidirectional Superior Cavopulmonary Anastomosis

Bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis may provide substantial advantages in the setting of both double switch procedures. It reduces complexity of the intraatrial procedure, because only the inferior vena cava is baffled to the tricuspid valve. This reduces myocardial ischemia time because (1) the cavopulmonary anastomosis can be performed during rewarming after the aortic clamp is removed and myocardial reperfusion is established, and (2) the simplified inferior vena cava baffling can be accomplished much more quickly than a full Mustard or Senning procedure. An additional advantage is that recognized complications of the full Mustard or Senning procedure (e.g., superior caval obstruction, pulmonary venous obstruction, sinus node dysfunction) are eliminated.

**Figure 55-17** Double switch concept using a Rastelli morphologic left ventricle–aortic intraventricular tunnel and an intraatrial Mustard baffle. **A,** Dashed lines on inset show the two incisions used for this procedure; one is along right atrial free wall, the other along subaortic infundibulum of left-sided morphologic right ventricle (MRV). Routine cardiopulmonary bypasstechniques and myocardial protection are used. After cardiac arrest, right atrium is opened and Mustard intraatrial baffle constructed. As illustrated, baffle suture line is almost completed. Details of Mustard procedure are provided in Chapter 52. The only important difference when the Mustard procedure is performed in congenially corrected transposition is that the surgeon must be aware of superior displacement of the atrioventricular node. **B,** After completing Mustard intraatrial baffle, the right atriotomy is closed with a running monofilament suture. The left-sided MRV infundibular incision is made, and exposure to intraventricular morphology is aided by a combination of stay sutures and retractors. In this case, the stenotic pulmonary valve and subpulmonic morphologic left ventricular (MLV) outflow tract are identified and closed internally with doubly pledgeted interrupted mattress sutures. Pulmonary anulus and subpulmonic region are exposed by gently retracting superior anterior aspect of rim of the ventricular septal defect (VSD) with a vein retractor, as illustrated.

![](_page_15_Picture_3.jpeg)

![](_page_16_Picture_2.jpeg)

**C,** Vein retractor on rim of VSD has been removed. Dotted line shows suture line used to create intraventricular baffle that will establish a pathway from the right-sided posterior MLV through VSD to left-sided anterior aorta. Note that exposure through this incision in MRV allows the surgeon to directly view MRV aspect of the ventricular septum, making it easy to place all sutures on right ventricular aspect of the rim of VSD, thereby avoiding direct injury to conduction system. It is important to realize that from this perspective on the MRV side, the vulnerable area for conduction injury is now at posterior and inferior aspect of VSD. **D,** A polyester tube graft of diameter approximately equal to that of the aorta is used to create MLV-to-aortic baffle. Natural curvature of resulting baffle patch is placed such that it is seen as convex when viewed through infundibular incision in MRV. Typically a running monofilament suture technique is used to place baffle. Routine care must be taken with respect to the conduction system along posterior inferior rim of VSD (see Chapter 35). Aortic end of baffle is sewn into place along the immediate subaortic musculature (see text for further details). As can be seen from **C,** there is potential for an hourglass deformity in the pathway from MLV to aorta at its midportion as the baffle passes the tricuspid valve anulus. Obstruction at this level can be avoided by attending to several factors. The baffle itself should be made particularly wide at its midportion. Additionally, the suture line should be placed into anulus of tricuspid valve at this level in order to maximize width of the pathway. Finally, judicious resection of muscle along floor of pathway in subpulmonic region at the upper rim of VSD may be helpful. It is critical to perform this resection with absolute knowledge of the position of conduction system. **Figure 55-17, cont'd** *Continued*

**E,** Procedure is completed by placing an external valved conduit from left-sided anterior MRV to pulmonary trunk. In this instance, the subpulmonic area was closed previously during the intracardiac portion of the operation **(B)**. Conduit is placed from infundibular incision in the MRV, coursing either to left or right side of aortic valve and ascending aorta. Positioning of conduit in this operation is somewhat more problematic than placing conduit from right-sided MLV to pulmonary trunk, as described in the "standard repair" in Fig. 55-16. Ventricular incision in MRV is more anterior and much more likely to be immediately substernal, increasing risk of compression. Whether to place the conduit to left or right of aortic valve and ascending aorta is an individual decision based on particular details of cardiac position within chest cavity. The principle is to place conduit in such a way that minimizes sternal compression. In this case, a composite graft of polyester and a bioprosthetic valve is used. Again, length of conduit is typically much longer than in cases of tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia. Similar to the situation described in Fig. 55-16, the valve is placed distally within the conduit, close to conduit to pulmonary trunk anastomosis. **Figure 55-17, cont'd**

**Figure 55-18** Double switch concept for situs solitus congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (CCTGA), with or without ventricular septal defect, and without pulmonary stenosis. **A,** Dashed line on right atrium shows proposed incision for performing Mustard intraatrial baffle. Dashed lines on aorta and pulmonary trunk show proposed incisions for transecting the great arteries and mobilizing coronary arteries. Cardiopulmonary bypass and myocardial protection are standard. **B,** Mustard intraatrial baffle is performed as described in Fig. 55-17 and as detailed in Chapter 52.

![](_page_18_Picture_2.jpeg)

**C,** Arterial switch component of procedure proceeds essentially exactly as described in detail in Chapter 52 for simple transposition of the great arteries (TGA). Although the great arteries in CCTGA are typically L-transposed, as compared with D-transposed in simple TGA, in principle there are no differences between the two situations. In CCTGA, the Lecompte maneuver is usually performed because the native pulmonary trunk is positioned posterior to the aorta. **D,** Completed arterial switch component. **Figure 55-18, cont'd**

Other advantages exist specifically in CCTGA with VSD and pulmonary stenosis. If an extracardiac conduit is necessary owing to severe pulmonary stenosis, its longevity will be extended because of reduced volume of flow it carries. This may be particularly pertinent in a small growing child. Additionally, if the morphologic RV size is reduced, either because of intrinsic reasons or as a result of a large morphologic LV– aortic baffle occupying part of its cavity, the bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis may provide superior hemodynamics. Finally, in patients with positional abnormalities such as situs solitus with mesocardia or dextrocardia, or with situs inversus, simplicity of the "hemi-Mustard" procedure makes it preferable to the full Mustard or Senning procedure.

For these reasons, bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis with hemi-Mustard procedure has become the preferred technique for performing the atrial component of the operation in both forms of the double switch for at least one of the authors.M1 The procedure is performed as described in Chapter 41 under "Bidirectional Superior Cavopulmonary Shunt." The double switch procedure, inferior vena cava–to–tricuspid valve atrial baffle (hemi-Mustard), and bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis are shown in Fig. 55-19.

### Placing Epicardial Pacemaker Leads

When complete heart block has been present intermittently or permanently preoperatively, or when it has developed intraoperatively, permanent epicardial atrial and ventricular pacemaking leads are placed, and a permanent pacemaker pulse generator is placed subcutaneously (see "Technique of Intervention" in Section I of Chapter 16).

# SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Patients are managed with protocols generally used after cardiac surgery (see Chapter 5). In patients with AV discordant connection such as these, particular attention is paid to the cardiac rhythm. When complete heart block is present, AV sequential pacing augments cardiac output and is therefore used routinely.

![](_page_19_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 55-19** Bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis and "hemi-Mustard" modification for double switch procedure for congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries. As in all double switch variations, atrial and arterial components can be performed in any order desired. In certain circumstances (see text), modifying the atrial component by performing a hemi-Mustard connection of the inferior vena cava to the tricuspid valve in combination with a bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis, rather than the full Mustard procedure, is beneficial. When this procedure is elected, the simplified intraatrial baffle can be performed either before or after the great artery component, whether that be a formal arterial switch or a Rastelli morphologic left ventricle–aortic intraventricular baffle. It is advantageous, however, to perform the bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis as the last component of the operation after removing the aortic clamp and establishing myocardial reperfusion. The intraatrial component of this procedure proceeds by performing a formal atrial septectomy (see "Mustard Technique" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 52). It may be advantageous in some cases to further enlarge the intraatrial opening by incising superiorly into the limbus of the atrial septum. The intraatrial baffle is much simplified, in essence constructing only inferior vena caval limb of Mustard baffle. Shape of baffle patch used is circular. Diameter of patch is equal to the straightline distance measured from most superior limit of tricuspid valve anulus to orifice of inferior vena cava. Suture line follows exact details of the standard Mustard patch around inferior vena cava orifice. Superior aspect of baffle is sewn around tricuspid valve orifice. Bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis is performed exactly as described in Chapter 41.

# RESULTS

Survival

*Morphologic Right Ventricle Supporting Systemic Circulation*

**Early (Hospital) Death** When operation is performed for CCTGA and VSD, hospital mortality has been 5% to 10%. When performed for CCTGA with coexisting VSD and important pulmonary stenosis, it has been 10% to 20%. When performed for coexisting left-sided tricuspid valvar regurgitation requiring valve replacement, it has been 15% to 25%.A1,B13,D3,L8,M8,S1,T3,W4,W6,Y4 Reducing hospital mortality is surely possible and has been documented in studies showing a reduction from 21% (17/82; CL 16%-26%) for operations performed prior to 1987 to 3.4% (1/29; CL 0.6%-11%) for those performed between 1987 and 1996.B13

**Time-Related Survival** The 1-month and 1-, 5-, 10-, and 20-year survivals after repair of important coexisting cardiac anomalies in heterogeneous groups of patients with CCTGA repaired over the past 35 years have been about 88%, 80%, 76%, and 46%, respectively, including hospital deaths.H12,Y4 In more recent experience, close to 90% 10-year survival has been demonstrated in a risk-unadjusted population of patients undergoing surgery for CCTGA.S8,V8 When a laterising phase of hazard will become evident in patients operated on in the current era is not yet known.

Hrasksa and colleagues suggest that time-related survival is best when a Fontan procedure is performed (100% at 5 years), with lower survival in septated patients undergoing VSD closure (75% at 5 years) and even lower survival in septated patients undergoing tricuspid valve surgery (55% at 5 years).H11 It should be emphasized that their patients underwent surgery between 1963 and 1996. Hörer and colleagues found similar long-term outcomes in patients undergoing septation and those undergoing a Fontan procedure.H5

*Morphologic Left Ventricle Supporting Systemic Circulation*

**Early (Hospital) Death** Early outcomes appear to be as good or better with more complicated double switch procedures ("anatomic repair") that assign the morphologic LV to the systemic circulation than with the "physiologic" procedures just described. Jahangiri and colleagues reported no mortality in the anatomic repair group (0 of 19 patients; 0%; CL 0%-10%), and 7% mortality in the physiologic repair group (5 of 70 patients; CL 4%-12%), *P* = .3.J1 Yeh and colleagues reported equivalent outcomes.Y4

In a group of patients with structurally abnormal tricuspid valves, mortality was 11% (1 of 9 patients; CL 1%-33%) following anatomic repair and 33% (5 of 15 patients; CL 19%-50%) following physiologic repair (*P* for difference = .2).A1

**Table 55-1** Causes of Early and Late Death in 151 Patients

Adapted from Shin'oka and colleagues (Table E1).S8

Results reported from 10 single institutional experiences between 1993 and 2002 reveal that early mortality for procedures placing the morphologic LV in the systemic circulation compares favorably with that of simpler, more classic repairs. In these 10 studies, early mortality ranged from 0% to 14%. Each experience was small, with a combined total of 150 patients with 11 early deaths (7.3%; CL 5.1%-10%).I2,I3,I5,K2,M9,R2,S5,S11,Y1,Y2

Reports between 2002 and 2010 have larger numbers of patients and confirm that early mortality can be low. In three recent large single-institution studies, early mortality was 0% (46 patients; CL 0%-4.0%),D11 2.1% (1 of 48 patients; CL 0.3%-6.8%),M1 and 6.8% (3 of 44 patients; CL 3.0%-13%).B15 These studies included both the arterial switch type and the Rastelli type of double switch. In another study focusing on 20 patients with the arterial switch type of double switch only, there was no early mortality.L9 Other large series report early mortality of about 15%.S7 Most studies show similar early mortality of the two major double switch operations, but Gaies et al. found a difference, with 94% early survival (33 of 35 patients; CL 87%-98%) in the arterial switch type and 77% survival (23 of 30 patients; CL 66%-85%) in the Rastelli type.G1

**Time-Related Survival** Recent data suggest midterm survival is excellent. Two studies with follow-up extending to 15 years (mean 5 years) show no intermediate mortality.L9,M1 Another shows 15-year survival of 75% in patients with the arterial switch type of double switch and 80% in patients with the Rastelli type.S8 Still another study of 45 patients (38 underwent the Rastelli type and 7 the arterial switch type) showed survival of 84% at 5 years and 78% at 10 years.K6 As with early mortality, most studies show similar time-related survival of the two major double switch operations, but the Gaies group reported a substantial difference, with 10-year survival of 91% in the arterial switch type and 55% in the Rastelli type.G1

# Modes of Death

Some patients die suddenly.M8,W6 This has even been noted when operation places the morphologic LV as the systemic ventricleM13; however, one large study suggests that it is more common following anatomic repair than physiologic repair.S8

Whether this is due to sudden appearance of complete heart block with ventricular asystole or fibrillation or to pacemaker failure or change in conductance of leads is unknown. Welldocumented progression of morphologic RV dysfunction and tricuspid valve regurgitation when these structures are in the systemic circulation no doubt play a role, particularly in those dying from low-output state and heart failure.S1 Table 55-1 shows cause of death in one series of 151 patients.S8

# Incremental Risk Factors for Death

Systemic tricuspid valve regurgitation is a risk factor for death.H12,R8,S8 Studies identifying Ebstein anomaly and tricuspid valve replacement as risk factors are probably identifying the same underlying problem of systemic tricuspid valve regurgitation.H11 Risk factors for death following anatomic repair have been identified and include left ventricular training using a pulmonary artery band and severe preoperative RV failure.Q2,S8 Inclusion of a bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis as part of the repair has a survival benefit.S8

Reasons for lower survival in patients with CCTGA than that observed after repair of VSD, AV septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, or transposition with AV concordant connection are not evident, even after risk adjustment. Speculatively, the major reasons may be abnormalities of the conduction system, imperfection of methods used to prevent and manage heart block, and abnormalities of systemic (right) ventricular function. It follows that patients receiving anatomic repair, although subject to the same conduction risks, would not have the additional risk of the systemic RV. In an analysis of 40 patients with a mean follow-up of 20 years, important regurgitation of the systemic tricuspid valve was found to be the major risk factor for death.P6 In another study,A1 presence of an abnormal systemic tricuspid valve resulted in early mortality of 33% (5 of 15 patients; CL 19%-50%) when the morphologic RV was assigned to the systemic circulation. Another study examining both anatomic and physiologic repair identified tricuspid regurgitation as a risk factor for physiologic but not anatomic repair patients.S8 Subsequent studies show both early and late survival after anatomic repair to be similar to survival following repair of the other index lesions mentioned.B15,D11,L9,M1 This improvement is probably due to multiple factors including presence of a systemic LV,

![](_page_21_Figure_2.jpeg)

increased experience with the complex procedures involved in anatomic repair, and improved management of conduction problems. In the meta-analysis performed by Alghamdi and colleagues, anatomic repair—in particular anatomic repair of the Rastelli type—had a beneficial effect on early survival compared with physiologic repair.A5

# Reoperation

Reoperation is common after all types of surgery for CCTGA except for the Fontan operation. The morphology of associated cardiac defects and the type of operation both influence the prevalence of reoperation (Fig. 55-20). Common causes for reoperation are those to be expected: heart block, ventricular-to–pulmonary trunk conduit obstruction or regurgitation, and systemic tricuspid valve regurgitation.

# Postrepair Complete Heart Block

It was anticipated that a repair (see Technique of Operation earlier) based on secure knowledge of location of the cardiac conduction system would eliminate complete heart block as a complication of VSD repair in patients with CCTGA.D3 Such has not been the case. In all reported series, prevalence has been 15% to 30%H14 (Table 55-2). This is very different from the near-zero prevalence after repair of VSD in hearts with AV concordant connection. Patients with atrial situs inversus have a lower prevalence of postoperative complete heart block, but it also does not approach zero.D6

PR interval is generally not lengthened by repair in patients in whom heart block does not develop perioperatively.C3 However, delayed intraventricular conduction, particularly to the left-sided RV, develops in about half of patients.

Multivariable analysis indicates that chordal straddling or insertion on the septal crest (usually from the left-sided tricuspid valve) increases the probability of producing complete heart block at the time of VSD repair (Table 55-3). This arrangement may prevent surgeons from placing sutures precisely where they prefer them. Presumably, placing the LV in the systemic circulation should have little effect on these rhythm complications. Malhotra and colleagues noted that 21% of patients developed complete heart block following surgery in a series of 48 double switches.M1

VSD+PS VSD only

In patients with complete heart block and systemic RV failure, improved ventricular function has been demonstrated in selected individuals by upgrading the pacing system to a biventricular system to achieve cardiac resynchronization.K8,K11

### Development of Tricuspid Valve Regurgitation

Immediately after simple classic repair of CCTGA with VSD, left-sided tricuspid valve regurgitation sometimes appears. Fox and colleaguesF2 reported this to have occurred immediately after repair in 6 of 14 patients (43%; CL 27%-60%) in whom it was not present before operation. Westerman and colleaguesW4 observed the same phenomenon. Its mechanism is not completely understood, but as best as can be determined, regurgitation does not result from direct damage to valvar tissue or chordae. Rather, its mechanism when the tricuspid valve is abnormal is primarily related to decreased morphologic LV pressure after VSD closure, resulting in shifting of the ventricular septum toward the morphologic LV side.A1,J1 It seems likely a similar mechanism is involved when the tricuspid valve is normal.

Operations assigning the morphologic LV to the systemic circulation result in improved tricuspid valve function,

probably for two reasons: the pressure in the morphologic RV is markedly reduced, and the ventricular septum is shifted toward the morphologic RV. Al., Il., J2, Ml This hypothesis is further supported by the work of Kollars and colleagues, who showed not only that systemic tricuspid valve regurgitation improved by increasing LV pressure with pulmonary artery banding but also that tricuspid regurgitation became worse in patients in whom LV pressure was reduced to less than half of systemic levels with an LV-to-pulmonary trunk conduit. Kl0 It also may be associated with development of complete heart block. W4

Tricuspid regurgitation may be sufficiently severe to require later valve replacement. Attempts at valve repair when the valve is in the systemic circulation are usually futile. Al, S3 In one series of 52 patients with up to 10 years of follow-up, tricuspid valve regurgitation was severe enough to require reoperation in 12 (24%). When the RV is placed in the

pulmonary circulation, tricuspid valve function typically improves, often without specifically surgically addressing the valve. <sup>13,15,12,M1</sup>

### **Functional Status**

In the study by Malhotra and colleagues in which all patients underwent anatomic repair, 91% were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I postoperatively. Similar functional outcome has been reported by others following anatomic repair. In the multicenter study of Graham and colleagues of patients with physiologic or no repair, 60% of those with associated defects were in NYHA class I, and 70% of patients without associated defects were in NYHA class I. Despite these functional class findings, the same study showed that by age 45 years, clinical heart failure was present in 67% of those with associated lesions and 25% of those without associated lesions; moderate or severe systemic RV dysfunction was present in 56% and 32%, respectively. Hraska and colleagues showed that only 40% of physiologically repaired patients were free of RV failure at 15 years.

#### Ventricular Function

The preponderance of evidence suggests that the systemic RV functions abnormally in unoperated patients at rest, even if they are asymptomatic. G5 If some form of physiologic repair has been performed, these preoperative abnormalities are more severe. Ischemia appears to play an underlying role in deterioration in most cases, along with other hemodynamic stresses such as volume overload from tricuspid regurgitation. Systemic RVs commonly show evidence of deterioration over time. Giardini and colleagues studied 34 patients at a mean age of 25 years with either CCTGA not undergoing anatomic repair or simple TGA following atrial baffle surgery. G3 The groups were similar. Abnormal myocardial fibrosis, determined by late gadolinium enhancement at MRI, was found

<sup>&</sup>quot;Heart block developed in 0 (0%; CL 0%-24%) of 7 patients whose repair did not include closure of a VSD and in 12 (21%; CL 15%-28%) of 58 who had a VSD closed as part of the procedure (P(Fisher) = .22).

in 41%. These findings were associated with RV dysfunction, poor exercise tolerance, arrhythmias, and progressive clinical deterioration. However, normal systemic RV systolic function late postoperatively has been found in some patients.H14 The rule is that after physiologic repair, even asymptomatic adult patients demonstrate abnormalities of the systemic RV, including reduced resting and stress ejection fraction, large ventricular volumes, and regional wall motion abnormalities.D8,G5,T7 Asymptomatic patients also demonstrate a neurohormonal profile typical of heart failure.K9 Additionally, systemic RV coronary flow reserve is reduced, even in unoperated patients and those with isolated CCTGA, with both ischemic and persistent perfusion defects.H2

When surgery involves placing the morphologic LV in the systemic circulation, early and midterm follow-up studies demonstrate both well-maintained LV and RV function.I2,M1,M9,R2 However, late systemic LV dysfunction has been observed, mostly in association with prior LV training and in patients with complete heart block requiring pacemakers.B3,Q2

# INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

CCTGA per se is not a definitive indication for a reparative operation. On the other hand, the natural history of the morphologic RV in the systemic circulation presents enough concern that the question of performing a double switch procedure should be left open. When VSD coexists, indications for operation are those for repair of VSD in otherwise normal hearts (see Indications for Operation in Section I of Chapter 35).

When VSD and important pulmonary stenosis coexist, repair may require an allograft-valved extracardiac conduit; surgical indications and staging are therefore the same as described for tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia (see Indications for Operation in Section II of Chapter 38). When important left-sided tricuspid regurgitation coexists, indications for operation are the same as those described for acquired mitral regurgitation (see Indications for Operation in Section I of Chapter 11). When complete heart block develops, indications and techniques for pacemaker intervention are those described in Technique of Intervention in Section I of Chapter 16.

Certain morphologic characteristics may increase difficulty of the various septation procedures described in this chapter: (1) presence of straddling tricuspid chordae—increasing complexity of the surgery and risk of postoperative complete heart block, (2) AV septal defect, and (3) non-committed VSD with pulmonary stenosis. These, among others, may be considered by some to be indications for a Fontan rather than a biventricular repair. Whatever the initial interventions, patients may ultimately develop a situation in which only cardiac transplantation can be effective.

# SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

# Anatomic versus Physiologic Repair

Definitive data are unavailable to determine whether longterm outcome is better in CCTGA with the morphologic RV or LV in the systemic circulation. A multicenter retrospective study of 167 patients undergoing repair did, however, show that long-term systemic AV valve function and systemic ventricular function were better in patients undergoing a double switch type operation compared with those undergoing physiologic repair (Fig. 55-21).L6 Surgical procedures are simpler technically when the morphologic RV is assigned to the systemic circulation, in theory reducing both short- and long-term complications related to reconstruction. However, available data from the same studyL6 indicate that surgically induced arrhythmias and reoperation are not higher in the more complex anatomic repair group (Fig. 55-22). Operative, midterm, and late mortalities following procedures placing the LV in the systemic circulation have been well documented over the past decade and are excellent.L6,M1

Even prior to 1998, superiority of the anatomic repair was evident. The meta-analysis of 11 different studies (in which all dates of operation were 1998 or earlier) performed by Alghamdi and colleagues showed that anatomic repair of the Rastelli type had superior outcomes to physiologic repair.A5

In a limited study of nine patients who underwent a procedure assigning the morphologic LV to the systemic circulation and six who underwent a procedure assigning the morphologic RV to the systemic circulation, exercise capacity was equivalent,O1 but this does not mean exercise capacity was normal. Other studies testing patients after both anatomic and physiologic repair reveal that oxygen uptake, exercise duration, heart rate responses, and other variables measured are subnormal.T2,Y3

### Left Ventricular Training

An important variable that must be considered when assessing long-term outcome following the double switch is whether it is necessary to train the morphologic LV with a pulmonary artery band. This situation arises only when the double switch is being considered in patients in whom the LV myocardial mass has involuted because it has been functioning at low pressure—that is, when CCTGA is present without VSD or pulmonary stenosis.

Although definitive evidence is lacking that trained LVs are functionally different from normal, there is concern and some suggestion that when placed in the systemic circulation, involuted LVs trained with a band may not perform as well as those that never involuted. Comparing trained LVs and those not requiring training, Quinn and colleagues showed that the early outcome after the double switch was similar for mortality and LV function, but there was increased risk of LV deterioration and death or transplantation over time in the trained LV group.Q2 Lim and colleaguesL6 suggest that LV training is a risk factor for death after anatomic repair. However, Bautista-Hernandez and colleagues showed that after anatomic repair, there was no reduction in LV function and no deaths at midterm follow-up in the cohort of patients who had received LV training with a band.B3

An important factor that limits drawing definitive conclusions about the adequacy of the trained LV is that there are currently no standardized criteria for defining when an LV is trained. Thus, any reduction in function of trained LVs following anatomic repair may represent an intrinsic limitation of the trained LV itself, or the fact that an adequate training protocol was not in place. It is clear that some LVs do not respond to training, and these patients never become candidates for a double switch procedure.Q2 (See Chapter 52 for more in-depth discussion of LV training.)

# Use of Bidirectional Superior Cavopulmonary Anastomosis

Use of the bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis with hemi-Mustard atrial baffle, either selectively or exclusively, as part of operations for CCTGA when the morphologic LV is placed in the systemic circulation has a number of specific advantages<sup>L6,M1</sup>:

- It may benefit the small or poorly functioning RV.
- It importantly reduces complexity of the atrial baffle procedure.
- It eliminates complications related to the superior limb of the atrial baffle.
- It reduces flow across an RV-pulmonary trunk conduit.
- It likely increases conduit longevity.

The study by Malhotra and colleagues documents that RV–pulmonary artery conduits have increased longevity when a bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis is used.M1 Lim and colleagues have demonstrated improved survival when it is used.L6 In some cases with VSD and moderate pulmonary stenosis, a bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis may allow use of the small native pulmonary valve as an adequate structure for RV outflow, avoiding a prosthetic conduit. In this operation, the native pulmonary valve and anulus, in continuity with the pulmonary trunk, are removed from the LV outflow tract intact and transposed onto the RV infundibulum. The resulting opening in the LV outflow tract is closed with a patch, and the LV is baffled to the aorta with an intraventricular tunnel.M1 The bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis and hemi-Mustard can also be helpful when constructing a full atrial baffle is difficult, such as in patients with juxtaposition of the ventricular apex and inferior vena cava, as found in mesocardia or dextrocardia with situs solitus. The bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis can also be used in specific cases when physiologic repair is performed.B1,L6

### Fontan versus Intracardiac Repair

After weighing the benefits and risks of performing the complex procedures described in this chapter versus those of a Fontan operation, one study concludes that the Fontan operation is advisable.D4 Many surgeons disagree, and recent outcomes after any of the various procedures that use the double switch concept or physiologic repair concept support their position.L6,M1 Reoperation is almost certainly higher after operations (both anatomic and physiologic) that septate the heart in CCTGA than for the Fontan, at least up to midterm follow-up (see Fig. 55-20).

# Neonatal Congenitally Corrected Transposition of the Great Arteries without Associated Cardiac Anomalies

The era of anatomic repair presents an interesting possibility for patients with CCTGA without associated lesions. Compared with normal control subjects, these patients are considered to have a reasonable prognosis without intervention, but a number of studies document that abnormal systemic RV function and even RV failure with systemic AV valve regurgitation are much more likely to occur over time, usually over decades. The question arises whether anatomic repair would benefit them. Although there is no evidence available to answer this question, it has been posed by many in the field.

If it is hypothesized that anatomic repair is beneficial, it can be argued that the neonatal period would be the optimal time for surgery to take advantage of the prepared LV. Allowing the LV to involute, followed by retraining with a pulmonary artery band, before anatomic repair is much less attractive because of concerns about the function of a retrained LV. To date, there are no reports of elective neonatal anatomic repair in asymptomatic patients with this anatomic profile. Bautista-Hernandez and colleagues report successful neonatal anatomic repair in two patients with Ebstein-like changes of the systemic AV valve and severe regurgitation with severe heart failure.B4

An alternative to neonatal anatomic repair in asymptomatic patients without associated cardiac anomalies is neonatal placement of a band, thereby preventing LV involution. Metton and colleagues have placed bands in 11 asymptomatic neonates and infants with isolated CCTGA.M10 Some degree of systemic AV valve regurgitation was present preoperatively in eight patients and depressed systemic RV function in two. The band procedure was performed without mortality, but five patients required inotropic support. There was one late death. In the remainder, there was no progression of systemic AV valve regurgitation in seven and improvement in three. Only one patient has undergone anatomic repair, successfully. The others are candidates, having preserved LV mass and function.

# **Section II Other Forms of Atrioventricular Discordant Connection**

### DEFINITION

Atrioventricular discordant connection is a congenital cardiac anomaly in which the right atrium connects to the LV and the left atrium connects to the RV (see "Cardiac Chambers and Major Vessels" in Chapter 1).2 When AV discordant connection occurs in atrial situs solitus, there is ventricular L-loop (left handedness of the ventricular internal architecture)A9,V1,V6; when it occurs in atrial situs inversus, there is ventricular D-loop (right handedness).

Conditions with AV discordant connection (other than CCTGA, covered earlier) are discussed together in this section. Were accumulated experience large enough, each of the other subsets would deserve separate chapters, just as in the setting of AV concordant connection.

# HISTORICAL NOTE

History of development of knowledge and surgical treatment of CCTGA is discussed in Section I. The time of first recognition of AV discordant connection associated with double outlet right ventricle (DORV) is not clear, but as late as 1960 the entity was not distinguished from DORV with concordant AV connection. Ruttenberg and colleagues described DORV coexisting with AV discordant connection in 1964.R9 In 1965, this type of DORV (with VSD and pulmonary stenosis) was recognized and repaired using an extracardiac conduit for rerouting pulmonary blood flow, perhaps for the first time.K4 Double outlet left ventricle (DOLV) associated with AV discordant connection is rare; the first surgical case was reported in 1976 by Brandt and colleagues.B17

*Isolated ventricular inversion* was named by Van Praagh in 1966 when he described one such case,V4 but a similar malformation had been reported by Ratner, Abbott, and Beattle in 1921R1 and by Lev and Rowlatt in 1961.L3 In 1975, Quero-Jimenez and colleagues reviewed six reported cases,

As noted in Section 1 of this chapter, the adjectives *left* and *right* used to modify atrium or ventricle always mean *morphologically* right or left. Position of the chamber is referred to as *right-sided* or *left-sided*.

including two of their own.Q1 *Isolated atrial inversion* was named when the first such case was reported in 1972.C6

# MORPHOLOGY

Among hearts with AV discordant connection, there is great variability in ventriculoarterial connections and in many other morphologic details.A4

### Ventricular Architecture

The ventricles are said to be inverted, but because many ventricular positional anomalies occur, the term *ventricular inversion* is not very useful; it is necessary to describe the internal architecture of each ventricle more specifically. A convenient way of doing this is with Van Praagh's terms *ventricular D-loop* and *ventricular L-loop*, defined in Chapter 1 (see "Situs of the Ventricles" under Terminology and Classification of Heart Disease in Chapter 1), or *right handedness* and *left handedness*, A9,V1,V6 also defined in Chapter 1.

### Ventricular Position and Rotation

In patients with atrial situs solitus, the RV is generally left sided and the LV lies side by side and to the right of it. The entire length of the ventricular septum is usually visualized in profile in an anteroposterior view during diagnostic imaging. However, there are variations in anterosuperior orientation of the ventricles and variations in their rotation (see "Cardiac and Arterial Positions" under Terminology and Classification of Heart Disease in Chapter 1).

### *Positional Anomalies*

An extreme variation of anterosuperior position occurs in so-called superior-inferior ventricles ("over-and-under" or "upstairs-downstairs" ventricles). The septum is not vertically oriented, as is usual in AV discordant connection, but horizontal, and the LV lies inferiorly and RV superiorly. This may have been described first by Kinsley and colleagues.K3 When ventricles are positioned in this manner, there is usually AV discordant connection, an inlet VSD, and DORV.H3,O4 One chamber may be hypoplastic, and there may be AV valve straddling. Rarely, superior-inferior ventricle position is associated with AV concordant connection and DORV (see "Double Outlet Right Ventricle with Superior-Inferior Ventricles" under Morphology in Chapter 53).

### *Rotational Anomalies*

When rotational anomalies are present, even more bizarre situations occur. Although the LV inlet portion generally remains on the right side in patients with atrial situs solitus, trabecular and outlet portions may be left sided and present a confusing picture.S9 Generally, however, the ventricular septum is in the coronal plane, the LV is posterior, and the RV anterior. In the domain of these extreme rotational anomalies, criss-cross pathways occur in which inflow pathways of the ventricles appear to cross rather than being parallel.A15,F3,F4,S14,T6 Then the question arises as to whether an AV discordant connection necessarily implies ventricular L-loop (or left handedness) in atrial situs solitus, and D-loop or (right handedness) in atrial situs inversus. In this text, the assumption is made that it does, although this may not always be the case.D12

### Ventricular Size

Varying degrees of hypoplasia of the left-sided RV may be present.E3 When the ventricles are in a superior-inferior position, the LV may be hypoplastic. Ventricular hypoplasia is frequently associated with straddling and overriding of the AV valve of the hypoplastic ventricle.

### Cardiac Position

Dextrocardia occurs in about 25% of cases with atrial situs solitus, and rarely levocardia exists when the atrial situs is inverted.C2

# Ventriculoarterial Connection

# *Discordant Connection*

The morphology of congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (AV discordant connection and ventriculoarterial discordant connection) is described in Section I.

# *Double Outlet Right Ventricle*

Double outlet left-sided RV may coexist with situs solitus and AV discordant connection (L-loop), and in nearly all cases VSD and pulmonary stenosis coexist. Because the left-sided RV is the systemic ventricle, cyanosis is not a necessary result of the ventriculoarterial connection, but of associated pulmonary stenosis. The apex of the heart may point to the right (dextrocardia with atrial situs solitus and ventricular L-loop).K4 The aorta is usually in L-malposition but may be in any position. The VSD is usually very distal in the septum and beneath the adjacent great arteries (usually pulmonary) but can be anywhere.

The pulmonary trunk is not in a wedged position. Probably related to this, location of the conduction system tends to be different from that in corrected transposition (see "Atrioventricular Node and Bundle of His" later).L7

This entity is closely related to corrected transposition with VSD in which the pulmonary trunk partially overrides the VSD and partly arises over the left-sided RV. Corrected transposition is the appropriate diagnosis when there is fibrous continuity between the pulmonary and mitral valves. When there is lack of continuity between these valves, there is subpulmonic conus muscle, and the case is assigned the diagnosis of *AV discordant connection with DORV*. In most cases of DORV and AV discordant connection, the pulmonary trunk is nearly completely over the left-sided RV.

### *Double Outlet Left Ventricle*

DOLV may coexist with AV discordant connection.B17,S12,V5 Because the right-sided LV is the pulmonary ventricle, cyanosis is the necessary result. The VSD is in a position similar to that in DORV with AV discordant connection, but the aorta overrides the VSD to such an extent that it emerges wholly or in large part from the right-sided LV. This may occur in patients with atrial situs inversus.A3

### *Concordant Connection*

Ventriculoarterial concordant connection is unusual in AV discordant connection and is of two types: isolated ventricular inversionQ1,V3 and isolated atrial inversion.C6 The systemic and pulmonary circulations are parallel, and the physiology is that of ordinary transposition of the great arteries (see "Essentially

![](_page_27_Figure_2.jpeg)

Intact Ventricular Septum [Poor Mixing]" under Clinical Features and Diagnostic Criteria in Chapter 52), and cyanosis results.

In isolated ventricular inversion with atrial situs solitus, as originally defined, V3 the aortic origin lies to the right and posterior to the pulmonary trunk origin, and there is aortic-mitral fibrous continuity and a muscular subpulmonary infundibulum (conus), as in the normal heart. However, there is AV discordant connection, and the aorta arises from a right-sided LV; for this reason, both great arteries are parallel. Other variations exist and are due to positioning of the great arteries and presence or absence of a subaortic and subpulmonic conus. A VSD may be present; pulmonary stenosis is generally absent. When there is situs inversus, a mirrorimage pattern occurs.

As in CCTGA, the inverted ventricles in patients with isolated atrial or ventricular inversion usually lie side by side with the ventricular septum in a sagittal plane and have a coronary artery distribution pattern similar to that in CCTGA (see Morphology in Section I). It is important surgically to note that in isolated ventricular inversion, the right-sided left coronary artery does *not* cross in front of the pulmonary outflow, so its enlargement anteriorly is feasible. Although Losekoot and colleagues have suggested that the conduction tissue will be as for CCTGA, <sup>L7</sup> position of cardiac conduction tissue in this condition is at present uncertain.

In isolated atrial inversion, there is atrial situs inversus with ventricular D-loop and dextrocardia with fibrous aortic-mitral continuity and a subpulmonary conus (Fig. 55-23, *A*, model 3). However, in a case reported by Clarkson<sup>C6</sup> (Fig. 55-24), the great arteries crossed in a virtually normal fashion, with

the morphologic RV lying to the right and posterior to the morphologic LV. The unusual feature of this heart was visceroatrial discordance, with abdominal organs in situs solitus position and the atria (and their venous connections) inverted. This rare additional feature did not alter the circulatory pathways from those present in isolated ventricular inversion.

In addition to the heart just described, there are others with identical connections but conal development that is the reverse of that described in isolated ventricular inversion (see Fig. 55-23, *B*, models 2 and 3). That is, the aorta arises from the morphological LV and lies, in a situs solitus heart, to the right of the pulmonary trunk, but it is separated from the mitral valve by a muscular subaortic conus. Under these circumstances, there is usually pulmonary-tricuspid fibrous continuity, but a subpulmonary conus may also (rarely) be present. These hearts can be considered to have anatomically corrected malposition of the great arteries, V2 or contrariwise (as in this text) a variant within the general category of AV discordant connection and ventriculoarterial concordant connection.

### Atrioventricular Node and Bundle of His

The AV conduction tissue is abnormal in most patients with AV discordant connection and typically so in the subset of CCTGA with atrial situs solitus, where an anterior AV node gives rise to the bundle of His (see "Atrioventricular Node and Bundle of His" under Morphology in Section I).

When DORV coexists and left-sided RV wedging of the pulmonary trunk is not present, both anterior and posterior AV nodes usually persist, connected by a sling of conduction tissue around the VSD, which continues on as the branching bundle. However, only the anterior AV node or the regular

posterior one gives rise to the penetrating bundle.L7 This variability may predispose patients to surgically induced complete heart block.

When there is DOLV, the AV node connecting to the penetrating bundle is usually the anterior one. Duplicated, or twin, AV nodes may exist, especially in the presence of malaligned AV septal defect. Reciprocating tachycardia may then be present.E2 Position of conduction tissue is uncertain in patients with isolated ventricular or atrial inversion.

# Accessory Conduction Pathways

Kent bundles may occur, particularly in those with CCTGA, and may give rise to preexcitation and the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (see "Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome" in Section III of Chapter 16).B12,S14 Kent bundles may be in the posterior wall of the left-sided RV or posterolateral wall of the right-sided LV. It is presumed by Bharati and colleagues that the relative frequency of these findings is associated with the high prevalence of Ebstein anomaly of the left-sided tricuspid valve in these cases.B12

# Coronary Arteries

Coronary arteries are abnormal, but appropriate terminology for describing them is controversial. The simple terms *rightsided* and *left-sided* seem best.L3 The right-sided coronary artery, arising from the right posterior coronary sinus and analogous to the normal left coronary artery, gives rise to the anterior descending coronary artery, coursing from right to left, and circumflex artery. The left-sided coronary artery arises from the left posterior aortic sinus and passes around the left-sided tricuspid orifice, usually to become the posterior descending artery on the back of the heart.L7

### Atrioventricular Valves

The right-sided mitral valve typically has two leaflets and usually is in fibrous continuity with the pulmonary valve. As in the normal heart, it has no septal attachments but rather has typically paired papillary muscles.

The left-sided tricuspid valve consists of three leaflets. The septal leaflet, and often the posterior (inferior) leaflet, is displaced more than normally into the ventricle, but the deformity is not typically an Ebstein malformation (see "Tricuspid Valve" under Morphology in Section I).

The AV valves may, uncommonly, straddle and override the ventricular septum. When overriding is greater than 50%, by convention the diagnosis is *univentricular AV connection with straddling and overriding AV valve* (see Morphology in Chapter 56). When overriding is less than this, the diagnosis is *AV discordant connection with straddling AV valve*. A left-sided tricuspid valve may override and straddle a VSDL5 and is at times associated with hypoplasia of the left-sided RV and at times with a superior-inferior position of the ventricles. More rarely, the right-sided mitral valve straddles and overrides a VSDB6,S9; this is invariably associated with hypoplasia of the LV and superior-inferior position of the ventricles.B6 When an AV valve straddles, the ventriculoarterial connection may be discordant, in which case the AV node is still anterior but is even farther anteriorly along the superior aspect of the right-sided mitral valve.B6 The penetrating bundle descends directly onto the ventricular septum without passing anterior to the pulmonary outflow tract. The ventriculoarterial connection may also be DORV.

### CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

The clinical features of patients with AV discordant connection vary widely, depending on ventriculoarterial connection and associated cardiac anomalies, most commonly VSD or pulmonary stenosis. Thus, there is no typical clinical picture.A19

## Congenitally Corrected Transposition of the Great Arteries

In this condition, pulmonary and systemic circulations are in series. Most commonly, both VSD and pulmonary and subpulmonary stenosis are present, so it is not uncommon for the presentation to be during the first year of life from sequelae of a large Qp . The clinical features and diagnostic criteria of this subset are fully discussed in Section I.

### Double Outlet Right Ventricle and Double Outlet Left Ventricle

There is no characteristic presentation of either DORV or DOLV coexisting with AV discordant connection. However, because with DORV there is usually coexisting pulmonary stenosis, cyanosis is usually evident; and because in this setting with DOLV the aorta arises from the ventricle receiving systemic venous blood (see Morphology earlier in this section), cyanosis is evident. Diagnosis is made by the same methods as described for CCTGA (see Section I). Echocardiography can usually define the morphology definitively, even in very complex cases.O4

# Isolated Ventricular or Atrial Inversion

Patients present similarly to those with complete transposition of the great arteries (see Clinical Features and Diagnostic Criteria in Chapter 41). When the ventricular septum is intact, there is severe cyanosis in infancyC2; when there is a large VSD, moderate cyanosis is accompanied by heart failure and cardiomegaly.Q1 Pulmonary stenosis adds to degree of cyanosis. Diagnosis is made by the same methods as described for corrected transposition (see Section I). Cineangiography has been important in the past for definitive diagnosis (Fig. 55-25), but now two-dimensional echocardiography is extremely reliable, even in this complex setting.P2

### NATURAL HISTORY

Most of the information concerning natural history drawn from patients with CCTGA is discussed in Section I. Other morphologic findings may affect natural history. For example, patients with situs inversus are more likely to have DORV and tetralogy of Fallot physiology, but less likely to have systemic AV valve regurgitation and heart block than patients with situs solitus.M12

# TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

Except for CCTGA, most malformations associated with AV discordant connection require complex and often unique operations, and only their general nature can be described.

Aorta arises from right-sided left ventricle. **B,** Lateral projection. **C,** Right ventricular injection, four-chamber position, anteroposterior projection.

When approaching such an operation, the surgeon must preoperatively obtain the best three-dimensional concept of the morphology, including probable location of the conduction system, and carefully plan the procedure using many of the principles described under Technique of Operation in Chapters 52, 53, and 54 and in Section I of this chapter. When single ventricle physiology coexists, techniques and principles described in Chapter 41 apply.

### Congenitally Corrected Transposition of the Great Arteries

See Section I of this chapter.

# Double Outlet Right Ventricle and Pulmonary Stenosis

Because the RV receives pulmonary venous blood (see Morphology earlier in this chapter), origin of the aorta from it is physiologically appropriate. The pulmonary trunk must be repositioned so as to receive blood from the LV if simple repair is chosen.

The proper approach to repair is less certain than it is in CCTGA because information about the conduction system is less complete. Further, there is controversy as to whether a completely intraventricular repair is adequate or whether a valved extracardiac conduit between LV and the pulmonary trunk is usually necessary.K4,V7 In part because of the data presented by Tabry and colleaguesT1,T5 and in part because important subpulmonary stenosis is usually present, use of a valved extracardiac conduit has been preferred. However, the concepts underlying the Lecompte, or REV *(réparation à l'étage ventriculaire),* operation (see "Lecompte Intraventricular Repair" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 53) may well be applicable in this and other subsets of AV discordant connection and would avoid use of an extracardiac conduit. Also, various double switch operations may be applicable (see Technique of Operation in Section I).

# Double Outlet Left Ventricle

The preferred surgical option consists of leaving the aorta with the right-sided LV, connecting pulmonary trunk to RV with a conduit, and performing an atrial switch operationS12 utilizing the double switch concept described under Technique of Operation in Section I.

The alternative physiologic repair, an intraventricular tunnel repair, may be used (see "Intraventricular Tunnel Repair of Simple Double Outlet Right Ventricle" in Chapter 53) and constructed so as to conduct blood from the leftsided RV (in atrial situs solitus) through the VSD and then to the aorta. Sutures between the polyester patch for the tunnel and the ventricular septum are placed with due regard for location of the conducting tissue (see "Double Outlet Right Ventricle and Pulmonary Stenosis" earlier in this section). On occasion, it may be possible to do this repair without obstructing LV access to the pulmonary trunk. However, if access is compromised or if pulmonary stenosis is present, an allograft-valved extracardiac conduit is placed between the LV and the pulmonary trunk (see Technique of Operation in Section I) or a Lecompte procedure (REV) performed (see "Lecompte Intraventricular Repair" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 53).

### Isolated Ventricular or Atrial Inversion

When the ventricular septum is intact, balloon septotomy is required in infancy, followed by an atrial switch operation (see Technique of Operation in Chapter 52). This returns the circulation functionally and anatomically to normal, because the LV is the systemic ventricle.C6

When there is a large VSD, it is closed through the left-sided RV in a fashion similar to that for primary VSD (presuming the bundle lies on the LV side) or from the right atrium.B2 An atrial switch operation is then performed.A17

# Placing Epicardial Pacemaker Leads

When complete heart block is present preoperatively or develops intraoperatively, and when in sinus rhythm the PR interval is long, permanent epicardial atrial and ventricular pacemaking leads are placed and connected to a permanent pacemaker pulse generator placed subcutaneously (see Technique of Intervention in Section I of Chapter 16 for the details of the technique).

# SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Patients are managed with protocols generally used after cardiac surgery (see Chapter 5). Particular attention is paid to cardiac rhythm. When complete heart block is present, AV sequential pacing is advantageous to cardiac output and therefore is used routinely.

# RESULTS

# Survival

### *Early (Hospital) Death*

Hospital mortality after intracardiac repair of coexisting cardiac anomalies in patients with CCTGA was discussed in detail in Section I. In series reported prior to 1985, mortality was generally higher in patients with AV discordant connection and other types of ventriculoarterial connections such as DORV, DOLV, and isolated ventricular inversion.A3,T1 This is probably related to complexity of the operations required for these conditions, often involving intraventricular rerouting and extracardiac conduits. However, increased knowledge about congenital heart disease, improved surgical techniques, and improved techniques for cardiopulmonary bypass and myocardial management currently allow lower mortalities.H3,I4,M9,S6,S15,Y2,Y4 This has been verified by recent studies indicating that when either classical repair techniques or the double switch concept are used, outcomes are comparable whether the associated morphology is transposition (CCTGA) or one of the other ventriculoarterial connections.B13,S8

### *Time-Related Survival*

Among all patients with AV discordant connection undergoing intraventricular repair prior to 1985, long-term survival has been compromised by a slowly rising late phase of hazard.M6 The long-term outcome concerns are supported by data from Yeh and colleagues, who show survival of 48% at 20 years.Y4 It is not yet certain that deaths occurring late postoperatively can be prevented as effectively as those occurring early after operation, nor has it yet been demonstrated that the double switch concept benefits long-term outcome.

### Modes of Death

In the past, most patients dying after early operation had acute or subacute cardiac failure.M6 Although abnormal ventricular architecture probably contributed to this, current methods, including improved methods of myocardial management, should considerably reduce the prevalence of this mode of death.

Some deaths late postoperatively have been sudden.M6,M8,W6 Whether this is due to sudden appearance of unidentified complete heart block with ventricular asystole, ventricular fibrillation related to myocardial dysfunction, or pacemaker failure is unknown.

### Incremental Risk Factors for Death

Probably AV discordant connection itself is a risk factor for death after intracardiac repair (see "Incremental Risk Factors of Death" in Section I). This is the result of abnormal ventricular architecture (see "Ventricular Function" under Natural History in Section I), abnormalities in the conduction system, problems associated with the tricuspid valve being a part of the systemic circulation, and relative unfamiliarity of even experienced congenital heart surgeons with approach and exposure to the surgical procedures required for this type of congenital heart disease.

Although early-era experience suggested that ventriculoarterial connections other than discordant ones (CCTGA) were risk factors for premature death,M6 more recent experience does not support the position that ventriculoarterial connections other than discordant ones are risk factors.H3,I4,M9,Y2

# Postrepair Complete Heart Block

It is disappointing that reasonably secure knowledge of the location of the bundle of His has not allowed complete heart block to disappear as a postoperative complication of repairing a VSD or constructing an intraventricular tunnel. There is about a 20% risk of developing complete heart block after repair of a VSD (Table 55-4; see also "Postrepair Complete Heart Block" under Results in Section I).

Risk factors for developing complete heart block are discussed in Section I of this chapter.

# Other Outcome Events

The discussions of developing left-sided tricuspid valve regurgitation, functional status, and ventricular function after repair of CCTGA (see Results in Section I) apply to all subsets of patients with AV discordant connection undergoing repair. When indications for cardiac transplantation are present, the procedure should be carried out.D9,R3

Outcome of valved extracardiac conduits frequently used in repairs for this group of anomalies appears to be the same as for their use in general (see "Reoperations" under Results in Section II of Chapter 38).

# INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

The diagnoses of DORV, DOLV, and isolated ventricular or atrial inversion in patients with AV discordant connection are indications for operation, but each has special considerations.

Isolated ventricular and atrial inversion have unrepaired pathophysiology and prognosis similar to that of patients with complete transposition of the great arteries (see "Essentially Intact Ventricular Septum [Poor Mixing]" in Chapter 52). Therefore, repair is indicated, and it should be performed as early in life as possible.

DORV and DOLV in the setting of AV discordant connection usually require a valved extracardiac conduit (or the Lecompte operation [REV]) for repair. Thus, there are advantages to deferring repair until age 3 to 4 years when an adult-sized conduit can be inserted, even though a palliative shunt or pulmonary trunk banding may be required in the interim. Alternatively, primary repair may be done in early life, accepting the likelihood of early conduit replacement. Knowledge of the concepts and techniques of Lecompte and others (see "Lecompte Intraventricular Repair" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 53) may, in some cases, allow repair without an extracardiac conduit, and this permits repair earlier in life.

When one ventricle is importantly hypoplastic, a Fontan operation can provide the same result as in other singleventricle patients (see Chapter 41).P5

When myocardial function has deteriorated severely, cardiac transplantation can provide the same result as in patients with AV concordant connection. Abnormal positions of the great arteries are not contraindications.

# SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

Many of the controversies surrounding management of CCTGA apply to all subsets of AV discordant connection (see Special Situations and Controversies in Section I).

### Intraoperative Electrophysiologic Mapping

The bundle of His can often be identified during cardiac operations by electrophysiologic mapping techniquesF1,K13,M2 that usually (but not always) allow localization of the bundle and, by implication, locus of the AV node. However, the procedure is cumbersome surgically because the heart must be open but perfused and beating during mapping, which means the patient must be on CPB at a normal or nearnormal temperature with the aorta not clamped for more than a few minutes (unless controlled aortic root perfusion is used during mapping). Risk of air embolization exists, and the CPB time is prolonged by 5 to 20 minutes. In the Mayo ClinicM3 and UAB experiences,F2 mapping did not reduce prevalence of complete heart block during VSD repair in patients with CCTGA, so intraoperative mapping is not routinely used at present.

### Routine Placement of Permanent Epicardial Pacemaker Leads

A selective approach to placing permanent epicardial pacemaking leads is followed, but some prefer to routinely place such leads. Should heart block develop, the transvenous route of placement (usually through the subclavian veinH3) is simple. Difficulty with stability of the intraventricular endocardial pacemaker lead has not been encountered, despite the relatively smooth interior of the right-sided morphologic LV.E2 Placing prophylactic epicardial myocardial leads at operation without connecting them to a pacemaker pulse generator would seem irrational, so unless a clear indication of need exists, this appears to be unwise. One important indication for placing prophylactic epicardial leads is if the cardiac repair involves use of a bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis, because transvenous access is not possible.
