# DEFINITION

Double inlet ventricle is a congenital cardiac malformation in which both atria connect to only one ventricular chamber by either two separate atrioventricular (AV) valves or a common AV valve. Closely related to double inlet ventricle are cardiac malformations in which both atria connect to only one ventricular chamber because of atresia of one AV valve that is imperforate or absent. As a group, double inlet ventricles and those with an atretic AV valve are appropriately considered as having a *single ventricle* or *univentricular AV connection,* although these phrases are not appropriate for describing morphology of an individual heart.A4

The ventricular mass in these settings rarely consists only of a solitary ventricle. When, as is usual, there are two ventricles, one is usually incomplete (rudimentary) and hypoplastic. Often the incomplete ventricle is connected to an atrium by overriding of an AV valve. Such arrangements are termed *double inlet ventricle* only if more than 50% of the overriding valve lies over the main (dominant) ventricle.

Classic tricuspid atresia (univentricular AV connection with atrial situs solitus, ventricular D-loop, single inlet left ventricular main chamber, right-sided AV valve [tricuspid] atresia, and ventriculoarterial [VA] concordant or discordant connection)A7,E4 is separately discussed in Chapter 41.1 Most

The adjectives *left* and *right* used to modify atrium or ventricle mean *morphologically* left or right*. Position* of a chamber or valve is referred to as *right sided* or *left sided*.

morphologic variants of left-sided AV valve (mitral) atresia with patent aortic outlet are included in this chapter. Mitral atresia in association with either aortic atresia or aortic stenosis, intact ventricular septum, and concordant AV and VA connections represent two of the four classic morphologic forms of hypoplastic left heart physiology and are discussed in Chapter 49.

# HISTORICAL NOTE

One of the earliest descriptions of a variety of this congenital anomaly was by Holmes, who in 1824 noted that it was intermediate between a normal heart and one with a solitary ventricular chamber.H1 It is believed that Peacock described a heart with "both auricles opening into the left ventricle" in 1854. Rokitansky described and illustrated a case of double inlet left ventricle in 1875, as did Mann in 1907, describing the heart as *cor triloculare biatriatum*. M3,R6 Taussig described "single ventricle with a diminutive outlet chamber" in 1939.T1 Lev and colleagues have listed a number of other descriptions of "single (primitive) ventricle" that were published more than 100 years ago.L4

An important contribution by Van Praagh and colleagues in 1964 at the Mayo Clinic was clear definition of the entity as one in which both AV valves empty into the same ventricle.V2 About the same time, Elliott and colleagues expressed the view, now accepted, that hearts with atresia of one AV valve (and thus a single AV valve) have much in common with hearts with double inlet ventricle.E4 Anderson and colleagues introduced the phrase *univentricular AV connection* to collate this group of malformations.A2,A3,A4,A7,S10,W5

Lev clearly established as a different entity hearts with a huge ventricular septal defect (VSD) or common ventricle, in which one side of the common chamber was morphologically right ventricle and the other left ventricle; he thereby excluded them from the single-ventricle category.L4

Surgical palliation of double inlet ventricle without pulmonary stenosis began with the original description of pulmonary trunk banding by Muller and Damman in 1952.M10 Palliation of double inlet ventricle with pulmonary stenosis has as its basis the original Blalock-Taussig shunt; its application to patients with double inlet ventricle and pulmonary stenosis was only a matter of time.B6 Redo and colleagues may have been the first to show the favorable effect of a Blalock-Hanlon atrial septectomy in patients with left-sided (mitral) valve atresia.R4

Septating the main chamber to establish two circulations in series emerged from the Mayo Clinic experience of unexpectedly encountering a patient with double inlet ventricle in 1956.M5 Preoperative diagnosis was corrected transposition with VSD, but correct diagnosis was made after opening the ventricle. Septation was accomplished, but the patient died about 6 months after operation, probably during a Stokes-Adams episode. This concept lay dormant for some years, but in 1972 it was further developed by Sakakibara and colleagues and in 1973 by Edie, Malm, and colleagues, who reported four successful septation repairs.E3,S2 Three long-term survivors of septation were reported in 1973 by Arai, Sakakibara, and colleagues, and one was reported by Ionescu and colleagues.A10,I2 McGoon, Danielson, and colleagues began to report successful results from the Mayo Clinic about this same time.M5 The right atrial approach to septation was suggested and applied by Doty and colleagues in 1979.D2

A different surgical concept—using the main (dominant) ventricular chamber for generating systemic blood flow and allowing the vis a tergo of the systemic venous system to generate pulmonary blood flow—was stimulated by the work of Fontan and Baudet (published in 1971 and known as the *Fontan operation*) and by the work of Kreutzer and colleagues.F2,K6,K7 Application of this concept to surgical treatment of double inlet ventricle was reported by Yacoub and Radley-Smith in 1976.Y1

Subaortic stenosis became apparent as a major problem when experience with the Fontan operation increased during the early 1970s.N3,R1 In 1973, Neches and colleagues applied the concept of placing the main chamber in direct communication with the aorta by performing an anastomosis of pulmonary trunk to aorta.N3,P2 Others have accomplished this by an anastomosis of the proximal segment of the divided pulmonary trunk to the side of the ascending aorta, a part of a Damus-Kaye-Stansel (DKS) operation.J1,N3,Y1 This concept has been revitalized more recently by extensive augmentation of the usually hypoplastic aortic arch in conjunction with the DKS operation in the Norwood I operation and by using the arterial switch operation for this purpose, first by Freedom, Williams, Trusler, and colleagues in 1980 and in neonates by Karl and colleagues in 1991.F5,J1,K1,R8 Penkoske and colleagues approached the problem directly by enlarging the VSD in 1984.P4

Application of cardiac transplantation to this group of patients was a natural evolution in managing patients with univentricular AV connections and myocardial failure.

# MORPHOLOGY

# Generalizations

# *Ventricular Mass*

The main (dominant) chamber making up the ventricular mass in double inlet ventricle with two ventricles may have a left ventricular internal architecture, a right ventricular internal architecture, or an indeterminate architecture. Main chamber volume is largest when there is no pulmonary stenosis but considerably smaller when pulmonary stenosis is present.K4 This is related to the fact that main chamber volume is positively correlated with pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio (Qp/Q s).S7 The nondominant, incomplete (rudimentary) hypoplastic chamber, when present, is always opposite architecture to the dominant chamber. Ventricular topology in double inlet ventricles may be either right-handed (D-loop), left-handed (L-loop), or indeterminate (Tables 56-1 and 56-2). (See "Symbolic Convention of Van Praagh" under Terminology and Classification of Heart Disease in Chapter 1.)V1

The nondominant chamber is called *incomplete* (or *rudimentary*) because it lacks one or more of its component parts, usually the inlet portion but occasionally also the outlet, leaving only the apical trabeculated part. The incomplete chamber is always smaller than the dominant chamber and is connected to the dominant chamber by a VSD. The VSD is sometimes called a *bulboventricular foramen,* but this term applies only when the incomplete chamber is of right ventricular morphology. Rarely, such as when there is double inlet to one chamber and double outlet from the other, both chambers are incomplete. The ventricular septum is malaligned

and incomplete in nearly all hearts with double inlet ventricle, or is completely absent.

Some consider a solitary ventricle with double inlet to be an indeterminate ventricle, and some consider it to be a right ventricle.V3,W4

# *Atria*

Any type of atrial situs can be present. However, with double inlet left ventricle, there is usually atrial situs solitus, and with double inlet right and indeterminate ventricles, about half have situs solitus and half have a heterotaxy pattern, right atrial isomerism predominating (see Chapter 58).A8 Situs inversus (mirror image) is unusual (see Tables 56-1 and 56-2).

#### *Atrioventricular Connection*

There are usually two perforate AV valves positioned entirely in the dominant ventricle. Their morphologic characteristics are frequently indeterminate, neither tricuspid nor mitral, and it is therefore best to call them *left-sided* (draining the

There are separate right-sided and left-sided atrioventricular valves entering a thick-walled large ventricular chamber with right ventricular morphology.

left-sided atrium) and *right-sided* (draining the right-sided atrium)R5 (Fig. 56-1). Alternatively, there may be a common AV valve (Fig. 56-2), although this is rare in double inlet left ventricle.A5 When the AV valve is a common one, valvar abnormalities are common, including important regurgitation.S11

In about 20% of cases, one of the perforate valves or the common valve overrides the remnant of ventricular septum, or the tension apparatus of one or both valves straddles the septum.A5 Rarely, a common patent AV valve overrides or straddles the septum.H2

Atresia of an AV valve usually involves total absence of the AV connection, but occasionally there is an imperforate membrane with a miniature tension apparatus beneath it.A9,R2,T4 Typically (as in classic tricuspid atresia; see Morphology in Chapter 41) the small, incomplete ventricular chamber is on the same side as the atretic valve, but it may be on the opposite side.

#### *Ventriculoarterial Connections*

VA connections can be of any type, except in the case of a solitary ventricle, where there can only be a single or double outlet. In double inlet left ventricle, the most frequent connection is discordant, with aorta and subaortic incomplete right ventricle (outlet chamber) to the left, but sometimes to the right, of the pulmonary trunk; concordant, double outlet, and single outlet connections occur (Table 56-3).

# *Conduction Tissue*

Morphology of the AV node and conduction system is abnormal. Position of the AV node is determined primarily by whether the ventricular septal remnant reaches the crux (see "Atrioventricular Node" under Conduction System in Chapter 1). From the surgeon's standpoint, it is important

to know that the AV node can be anywhere around the perimeter of the right-sided AV valve.

#### *Coronary Arteries*

Terminology of the coronary artery branches is arguable. Left and right coronary arteries usually arise from the two aortic sinuses facing the pulmonary trunk. There are usually prominent descending branches (encircling coronary arteries) that indicate points of attachment of septum to free ventricular wall, and therefore the boundaries of the incomplete ventricle.L4,R7

#### Types

#### *Double Inlet Left Ventricle*

In double inlet left ventricle, the most common double inlet connection, the dominant ventricle is of left ventricular morphology.L3,V1,V3 Apical trabeculations beyond insertions of the papillary muscles display a delicate criss-cross pattern. The septal surface is typically smooth in its superior half, and the crescentic margin bounding the VSD is smooth (Fig. 56-3). VSD morphology, however, can be variable. Of 46 patients with double inlet left ventricle carefully evaluated by Bevilacqua and colleagues, 24 had VSDs separated from the semilunar valves and completely surrounded by muscle (muscular defects), 19 had VSDs adjacent to the anterior semilunar valve (subaortic defect) in association with malalignment or

hypoplasia of the infundibular septum, and 3 had multiple muscular defects.B3

The small incomplete (rudimentary) ventricle is of right ventricular morphology, with coarse apical trabeculations and frequently a recognizable trabecula septomarginalis (septal band) bounding the VSD anteriorly. A smooth-walled infundibulum is present when one or both great arteries arise from this chamber (Fig. 56-4). Otherwise, and rarely, the chamber exists as a blind pouch. It is always positioned on the anterosuperior shoulder of the dominant left ventricle (Fig. 56-5), usually to the left but sometimes to the right. The septum thus lies obliquely and never extends to the crux.

The typical morphology of double inlet left ventricle, with ventricular L-looping, left-sided incomplete right ventricle, and VA discordant connections, occurs in about half of all cases, with a wide variety of VA connections in the remainderU1 (see Table 56-3). The relatively uniform internal cardiac architecture of the AV valves and myocardium in typical double inlet left ventricle may be more variable when double outlet right ventricle occurs with it.S3 Atrial situs is usually solitus, occasionally ambiguus, but rarely situs inversus.

Two variants of double inlet left ventricle warrant further description: (1) double inlet left ventricle with ventricular L-loop, left-sided incomplete right ventricle, and VA discordant connection and (2) double inlet left ventricle with ventricular D-loop, right-sided incomplete right ventricle, and VA concordant connection.

**With Ventricular L-Loop, Left-Sided Incomplete Right Ventricle, and Ventriculoarterial Discordant Connection** This is the largest subset of hearts with double inlet ventricle, comprising half the cases (see Figs. 56-3 through 56-5). The large left ventricular main chamber lies to the right and receives left-sided and right-sided AV valves, which usually are of tricuspid and mitral morphology, respectively, although both may be bicuspid. There may be some straddling and overriding (but <50%) of the AV valves. The majority of AV valves function normally, but the most common abnormality is stenosis of the left-sided "tricuspid" valve.B3 A heavy trabecula often separates insertion of the papillary muscles into the diaphragmatic free wall of the left

ventricle. The left-sided tricuspid valve commonly has attachments of the subvalvar tension apparatus to the ventricular septum.D1

The aorta arises above the short infundibulum of the incomplete left-sided right ventricle (see Fig. 56-4). The pulmonary trunk arises from the base of the left ventricle, anterior and superior to the right-sided AV ("mitral") valve, usually with pulmonary-mitral fibrous continuity. Subvalvar and valvar pulmonary stenoses occur but are not common, and pulmonary atresia occurs only occasionally.

The VSD is usually large and lies beneath the infundibular septum, but it may be restrictive, producing subaortic stenosis (see "Subaortic Stenosis" later under Natural History). As noted, the VSD may be in an atypical position within the apical septal trabeculations, and occasionally it is multiple. Muscular defects are more likely than subarterial defects to be restrictive.B5

The AV node is anterior and away from the atrial septum, lying in the right atrial wall adjacent to the superior commissural tissue between anterior and posterior leaflets of the right-sided AV valve.A3,B4,E5 This arrangement also pertains to ventricular D-loop when the left ventricle is the main chamber, because again there is no ventricular septum extending to the crux. The bundle of His passes anterior to the pulmonary valve to reach the ventricular septum (see later Figs. 56-19 and 56-21).A3,B2,B4

Configuration of coronary arteries is similar to that in congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (see

**Figure 56-6** Interior view of specimen with double inlet right ventricle and ventricular D-loop. There are two atrioventricular valves. The larger chamber has typical right ventricular morphology, and the diminutive incomplete left ventricle (LV) lies posteriorly and to the left (in the hip pocket).

**With Ventricular D-Loop, Right-Sided Incomplete Right Ventricle, and Ventriculoarterial Concordant Connection** This occurs in about 10% of cases and most resembles the normal heart. The large left ventricle lies to the left and posteriorly, and the small right ventricle lies to the right, anteriorly and superiorly. It was first described by Holmes and is often called the *Holmes heart*. A6,H1

There are usually two AV valves (often with the right-sided one straddling but with less than 50% override) or a common valve. The incomplete right ventricle is similar to that present in classic tricuspid atresia, with an extensive infundibulum leading to a pulmonary valve that is normally related to the aortic valve. Pulmonary stenosis is common, and the VSD may be restrictive.

The AV node is again anterior at about the 11-o'clock position relative to the right AV valve, as seen by the surgeon from the right atrium. The bundle of His descends from the anteriorly positioned AV node directly onto the ventricular septum without coming into relation with the ventricular outflow tract.E6,W3 Rarely the AV node and bundle encircles the anterior aspect of the right AV orifice.A6

#### *Double Inlet Right Ventricle*

In double inlet right ventricle, both atria connect to a morphologically right ventricle. Apical trabeculations are coarse, and the trabecula septomarginalis is recognizable on the septal surface, with the VSD contained between its anterior and posterior limbs. The incomplete left ventricle is always positioned posteriorly and inferiorly ("in the hip pocket") in relation to the main chamber and usually lies to the left (D-loop; Fig. 56-6) or rarely to the right (L-loop). More often than not, it is very small and slitlike, communicating with the main chamber by a tiny VSD, with no connection to a great artery.K3,S11 In other cases, the left ventricle is of reasonable size and the obliquely placed septum is well

formed; in contrast to that in double inlet left ventricle, it extends superiorly to the crux. In these cases, fine apical trabeculations are recognizable, and the superior septal surface beneath the VSD is smooth.

The VA connection is usually double outlet or single outlet (pulmonary atresia) from the right ventricle (Fig. 56-7; see also Fig. 56-1). A concordant connection sometimes occurs, with the aorta arising from the incomplete left ventricle. Pulmonary stenosis can be present.S9

Two AV valves may enter the large right ventricle, with the left one straddling, or frequently a common AV valve. Atrial situs inversus, and particularly right atrial isomerism, is more common in double inlet right ventricle than in double inlet left ventricle. Double inlet right ventricle associated with right atrial isomerism seems to be particularly prevalent in the Chinese.W1

In the presence of a D-loop and a ventricular septum reaching the crux, the AV node has its usual posterior position in the atrial septum with its normal relation to the ostium of the coronary sinus.W6 The perforating bundle of His passes through the AV anulus and on to ventricular myocardium, either on the ventricular septum or on a trabecula on the posterior ventricular wall. In rare L-loop, the conduction system is variable, but a conventionally located AV node may be present, as well as a more rudimentary node located more anteriorly and superiorly along the right-sided AV anulus.E5 The nonbranching bundle then descends onto a free-running trabecula in the main chamber.

# *Double Inlet Indeterminate Ventricle*

Double inlet indeterminate ventricle includes hearts in which both atria connect to a solitary ventricle.W4 Prevalence of this subset depends on the care with which a search is made for the possibility that the malformation is actually double inlet right ventricle, because a tiny isolated accessory ventricular chamber may be missed by cardiac imaging and may be found only on careful autopsy examination. Even when the ventricle is truly solitary, it may represent a morphologically right ventricle without a rudimentary left ventricle, because apical trabeculations are always coarse, and there may be a freestanding column posteriorly reminiscent of the trabecula septomarginalis (see Fig. 56-7).V3

There is a higher prevalence of heterotaxy in double inlet indeterminate ventricle than in the other types of double inlet ventricle. With it, as well as with atrial situs solitus and inversus, two perforate AV valves are usually present. The only VA connection possible is double or single (pulmonary atresia) outlet ventricle. Pulmonary stenosis is common. The great arteries are often more or less normally related.

The AV node is usually posterior when there is a rudimentary ridge in the ventricle and distinct papillary muscles to both AV valves. In this case, the AV node passes down a free-running trabecula.W4 When a ridge is absent, the AV node is usually situated laterally (away from the atrial septum) and anteriorly, and the nonbranching bundle descends into the right parietal wall of the indeterminate ventricle.W4

#### *Common Ventricle*

Rarely an apparently common (solitary) ventricle has no ventricular septum or a diminutive apical ridge, but importantly, one side of the ventricular mass is morphologically right ventricle and the other morphologically left. Lev and colleagues consider this to be a heart with a huge VSD rather than double inlet common ventricle.L4

# *Left Atrioventricular (Mitral) Valve Atresia and Patent Aortic Outlet*

Left-sided AV (mitral) valve atresia with patent aortic outlet has a widely varying morphology.R5,T4 All variants are discussed here, with one exception: mitral atresia with patent aortic outlet (aortic stenosis) with intact ventricular septum, atrial situs solitus, levocardia, single inlet right ventricle with D-loop, and hypoplasia of all left cardiac segments, together with VA concordant connection. This variant is considered one of the four classic morphologic variants of hypoplastic left heart physiology, along with mitral atresia–aortic atresia, mitral stenosis–aortic atresia, and mitral stenosis–aortic stenosis (see "Left Ventricle and Mitral Valve" under Morphogenesis and Morphology in Chapter 49).

The atretic valve may be imperforate, in which case there is a hypoplastic membrane, sometimes with a miniature chordal apparatus beneath it; or the AV connection may be absent, with the floor of the atrium being separated from the ventricle by fibrofatty tissue.A9,T4 In a study of 23 patients with patent aortic outlet and atresia of the left AV valve, 15 had absence of the left AV connection, 5 had an imperforate left AV valve, and 3 had atrial isomerism. Those with imperforate left AV valve demonstrated concordant AV connections.A11

The patent right-sided AV valve may occasionally override the remnant of ventricular septum,K5 but with more than 50% of the anulus committed to the larger right ventricular chamber. The tension apparatus may straddle the septum, which reaches the crux.H2

In this most common arrangement ("mitral" atresia), there is atrial situs solitus, ventricular D-loop, and a dominant right ventricle connected to the right atrium by a patent right-sided (usually tricuspid) AV valve and a small and incomplete left ventricle lying posteriorly and to the left (Figs. 56-8 and 56-9).G2 The left ventricle may be a blind chamber connecting to the right ventricle by a small VSD (in which case the VA connection is either double or single outlet right ventricle), but more commonly it functions as an outlet chamber giving origin to the aorta (concordant VA connection) and rarely to the pulmonary artery.T4 The left ventricle is often smaller than suggested by the position of the left anterior descending coronary artery (see Fig. 56-9). Characteristically, when the aorta arises from the small left ventricle, the VSD is restrictive and the aorta small in association with coarctation or aortic arch hypoplasia.T4 Interatrial obstruction is also common.

Alternatively, and less commonly, the arrangement is atrial situs solitus and ventricular L-loop with single inlet and more or less right-sided left ventricle, in which case the right atrium

is connected to the dominant left ventricle by a patent AV valve with either mitral or indeterminate morphology. There is an incomplete left-sided right ventricle situated anteriorly and to the left, above which is the atretic left-sided AV valve, and the VSD may be restrictive. The septum does not reach the crux. The usual VA connection is discordant with the right ventricle giving origin to the aorta, but double outlet left ventricle also occurs.

#### *Right Atrioventricular (Tricuspid) Valve Atresia*

Excluding cases of classic right-sided (tricuspid) valve atresia (see Chapter 41), right-sided AV valve atresia can occur with single inlet and more or less left-sided right ventricle (ventricular L-loop). Right AV valve atresia has also been reported in association with an indeterminate solitary ventricle.A9 The patent left-sided AV valve may occasionally override the septum and may have multiple leaflets.K5

# Associated Cardiac Anomalies

Associated cardiac anomalies occur in at least one third of patients with double inlet ventricle. AV valve malformations are common and include leaflet dysplasia, leaflet cleft and tags, and anular hypoplasia, in addition to straddling.Q1,Q2 These can produce either valvar regurgitation or stenosis. The pulmonary valve may be stenotic from anular hypoplasia and leaflet thickening, or it may be atretic. Subvalvar pulmonary stenosis is common and results from either infundibular narrowing (muscle hypertrophy, hypoplasia, or occasionally a deviated septum) (see Fig. 56-1) or, more commonly, a restrictive VSD leading to an outflow chamber from which the pulmonary trunk arises (see Fig. 56-4). Aortic arch anomalies (coarctation, aortic arch interruption, or arch hypoplasia) also sometimes coexist with single ventricle (see Table 56-2). Multiple VSDs are not rare.

Subaortic stenosis is one of the most important coexisting cardiac anomalies. Because of the variable time of its appearance, it is discussed later under Natural History.

# CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

Clinical manifestations vary with morphology. Patients without pulmonary stenosis or atresia, about one third of the total, present in a manner similar to those with tricuspid atresia and normally related great vessels without pulmonary stenosis or atresia (see Clinical Features and Diagnostic Criteria in Chapter 41).

When mild or moderate pulmonary stenosis coexists, early years of life may be without important symptoms. A Qp/Q s of approximately 2 or less results in only moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary overcirculation on the chest radiograph and good functional status, albeit with mild cyanosis. Presentation in early or middle childhood rather than in infancy is common and is usually precipitated by cyanosis, a cardiac murmur, or typical findings on a chest radiograph. Clinical presentation is similar to that of tricuspid atresia and normally related great arteries with mild to moderate pulmonary stenosis (see Chapter 41).

When pulmonary stenosis is severe or pulmonary atresia is present, important cyanosis usually results in presentation in the early days or weeks of life, similar to that of tricuspid atresia and normally related great vessels with severe pulmonary stenosis or pulmonary atresia.

Atresia of the left-sided AV valve, when combined with a restrictive foramen ovale, results in severe pulmonary venous hypertension with its typical chest radiographic appearance and severe respiratory distress in early life. The presentation can mimic that of classic hypoplastic left heart physiology with restrictive or intact atrial septum (see Chapter 49). This situation may be masked initially by pulmonary stenosis and small pulmonary blood flow, only to become apparent after a systemic–pulmonary artery shunt is created. Severe AV valve regurgitation results in elevated atrial pressure and early appearance of heart failure.

Double inlet single left ventricle with AV and VA discordant connections, restrictive VSD (bulboventricular foramen), and aortic arch hypoplasia typically mimics hypoplastic left heart physiology in its presentation (see Chapter 49).

The electrocardiogram and chest radiograph may raise suspicion of the presence of double inlet ventricle, but echocardiography usually is the first definitive diagnostic procedure. Absence of the posterior (inlet) septum between the AV valves, one of the hallmarks of double inlet ventricle, can usually be diagnosed from the echocardiogram, particularly when associated with apposition of the unsupported septal leaflets of the two AV valves.B1,C1,F1 Echocardiography with Doppler color flow imaging can provide all the necessary diagnostic information (Figs. 56-10 and 56-11).H4,L2

Cineangiography may be performed (Figs. 56-12 and 56-13) but currently is not necessary for planning therapy in the neonate or infant, and may be disadvantageous to the condition of the patient. It should be recalled that the Holmes heart is easily misdiagnosed as tetralogy of Fallot.S1 Cardiac catheterization and cineangiography can provide important information about the patient presenting in older infancy or later, or about the patient who has previously undergone surgery, primarily by defining pulmonary vascular resistance and morphology of the branch pulmonary arteries.

Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography have little diagnostic role in the neonate.

# NATURAL HISTORY

# Double Inlet Ventricle

Estimated overall survival without treatment is about 57% at 1 year and 45% at 5 yearsF3,G1,M1,M9 (Fig. 56-14). The monumental study by Franklin and colleagues documented the relatively favorable prognosis of certain subsets. Specifically, patients with atrial situs solitus and double inlet left ventricle, ventricular L-loop, discordant VA connection without systemic outflow obstruction, Qp/Q s of about 1 to 2 (due to mild to moderate pulmonary stenosis), and presentation between 14 and 60 days of age have about a 90% chance of surviving for at least 10 years without intervention (Fig. 56-15). Estimated survival without intervention of other commonly encountered subsets is illustrated in Figs. 56-15 and 56-16. Although the natural history impact of differing AV connections has not been clearly defined, evidence exists that differences in left ventricular function are present depending on whether the inlet connection has two patent valves or one (Fig. 56-17).R3

Presentation with severe acidosis and low cardiac output has been a particularly severe risk factor for early death without intervention.F3 Systemic outflow obstruction at any level, particularly aortic atresia, is also a strong risk factor for early death.

#### Mitral Atresia

When atresia of the left AV valve coexists with a restrictive opening in the atrial septum, such as in mitral atresia (atrial situs solitus, ventricular D-loop, right ventricular main

chamber, and absent or imperforate left AV valve), the situation is rapidly fatal; death usually occurs within the first few months of life. Prognosis is the same in patients with ventricular L-loop and left-sided AV valve atresia (i.e., left-sided tricuspid atresia). Even when the foramen ovale is not restrictive in early life, in this condition there is a strong tendency for it to become restrictive later in infancy or in early childhood.S13

#### Subaortic Stenosis

The tendency to develop subaortic stenosis when the aorta arises from the incomplete ventricle (outlet chamber) poses a serious threat. This category includes patients with

- (1) double inlet left ventricle and VA discordant connection,
- (2) tricuspid atresia and VA discordant connection, and
- (3) mitral atresia and VA concordant connection. The

subaortic obstruction is usually caused by a restrictive VSD; however, sometimes muscle within the incomplete subaortic ventricle is the cause, not a small VSD per se. The three morphologic variants have a similar natural history, which is discussed in detail for tricuspid atresia and VA discordant connection in Chapter 41.

#### **TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION**

#### Fontan Operation

Patients are commonly managed clinically as "single ventricle" physiology. This approach usually results in a definitive Fontan operation, but one or more staging operations done before the Fontan procedure are usually required. These include various forms of pulmonary trunk banding (see "Pulmonary Trunk Banding" in Section I of Chapter 35 and in Section II of Chapter 41), systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunting (see "Techniques of Shunting Operations" in Section I of Chapter 38 and in Section II of Chapter 41), and superior cavopulmonary anastomosis<sup>B7</sup> (see Chapter 41). Timing, number, and appropriate application of these staging operations, and details of the Fontan operation itself, are described under Technique of Operation in Section IV of Chapter 41. Table 56-4 lists the palliative procedures performed in 225 patients with double inlet left ventricle prior to the Fontan operation.<sup>E1</sup>

#### Closure of Right Atrioventricular Valve

When one AV valve is regurgitant and the other is more or less normal in size and function, the regurgitant valve is closed, either before or as part of the Fontan operation. When both valves are competent and of adequate size, there has been concern that leaving both open will permit flow through each to be only half normal, and that this may encourage thrombosis in and around the valve. There is no strong support for this concern, however, and it appears reasonable at present to leave both open.

If one AV valve is closed surgically, it is usually the right-sided AV valve. Technique of closure must be secure and not produce heart block. Both criteria are met by polyester patch closure of the area occupied by the valve, sewing the patch in place with a continuous whipstitch of 4-0 polypropylene suture in a way that avoids heart block (Fig. 56-18). This can

**Figure 56-18** Right atrioventricular (AV) valve may be closed as part of Fontan-type repair in double inlet left ventricle. Several possible locations of AV node and proximal bundle of His are shown. Because the location in a given patient is not known precisely, suture line for patch closure of right-sided AV valve is 5 mm outside anulus all the way around.

be achieved by sewing the patch as shown in the figure, or by sewing it precisely to the valve anulus itself. Because the underlying AV valve can open and close beneath the patch, and because thrombi might form between patch and valve, a stitch is placed through the midpoint of the free edge of each leaflet and then through the center of the patch and tied on the atrial side. This is most conveniently done after placing the posterior half of the patch suture line. Simpler techniques of suturing together the free edges of the leaflets, or suturing the patch to the leaflets themselves inside the hinge line, have been associated with more dehiscences than the technique described.

#### Septation

The septation operation can be performed in either one or two stages. Both procedures are performed exactly the same way as described in text that follows, with the exception that in the two-stage procedure, after the main septation patch is placed, a large hole is made in the center of the patch to create a nonrestrictive VSD. A pulmonary artery band is also placed if there is absence of pulmonary stenosis. At the second stage, performed 6 to 12 months later, the created VSD is closed with a second patch sewn to the first one, and the pulmonary artery band is removed and pulmonary artery reconstructed. The two-stage procedure tends to be performed in smaller patients, particularly those with relatively small ventricular chamber size.M4

Although septation occasionally can be applied under appropriate circumstances to several types of double inlet left ventricular main chamber and anterior outlet chamber (and possibly a few with double inlet right ventricle), it is most commonly applied to double inlet left ventricle, ventricular L-loop, and small left-sided subaortic right ventricle. Thus, it is described for this situation. In the series of 11 patients reported by Margossian and colleagues, nine had double inlet left ventricle, one double inlet right ventricle, and one double inlet indeterminate ventricle. Of the nine patients, five had L-transposition of the great arteries, three had normally related great arteries, and one had D-transposition of the great arteries.M4

Preparation, draping, incision, and preliminaries to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) are the same as for most operations (see "Preparation for Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2). The aortic purse-string suture may be awkward to place and is most easily done as described for corrected transposition (see Technique of Operation in Section I of Chapter 55).

Cardiac morphology is examined, particularly to identify anomalies of pulmonary or systemic venous return or of AV valve regurgitation. The ventricular mass is frequently enlarged. Interestingly, the right atrium does not usually appear to be as large as it is in patients with isolated VSD, atrial septal defect, or tetralogy of Fallot, but this should not discourage use of the atrial approach.

The approximate size of the septation patch is determined before CPB. This is done by noting the external dimensions of the ventricular mass and subtracting estimated wall thickness.M7 An appropriate-sized patch is cut from a polyester tube (see "Grafts for Use in Aortic Surgery" under Special Situations and Controversies in Chapter 24) or alternatively, polytetrafluoroethylene.M4 Although the patch usually seems too small, this size is appropriate because if it is made too large, it bulges into the right ventricle with each systole and impairs cardiac function.S4 If it is made too small, there is an increased tendency toward dehiscence.

CPB is established by the usual techniques (see "Preparation for Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2), using direct caval cannulation. Myocardial management is by cold cardioplegia and controlled reperfusion (see "Cold Cardioplegia, Controlled Aortic Root Reperfusion, and [When Needed] Warm Cardioplegic Induction" under Methods of Myocardial Management during Cardiac Surgery in Chapter 3) or by simple single-dose cold crystalloid cardioplegia (see "Single-Dose Cold Cardioplegia in Neonates and Infants" in Chapter 3). The patient is usually cooled to 18°C to 20°C so that periods of circulatory arrest can be used when needed to improve exposure. A small right atriotomy is made and a pump-oxygenator sump sucker passed across a natural or surgically created foramen ovale. The atriotomy is extended into the usual long oblique atriotomy, and stay sutures are applied (Fig. 56-19).

The interior of the left ventricular main chamber is examined through the right-sided AV valve. The subpulmonary area is visualized, as are the VSD, left-sided AV valve, and the relation between these structures. A determination is made whether the repair can be made through the intact right AV valve or whether a radial incision needs to be made in its base. Such an incision (see Fig. 55-15, *B* in Chapter 55) gives a direct approach to the area between the tension apparatus of the left-sided and right-sided AV valves where the sutures for septation must be placed.

A few marking sutures are placed to outline the proposed septation suture line (see Fig. 56-19, *A-B*). Goals are to (1) partition the two ventricles about equally; (2) provide unobstructed pathways from right atrium through the right-sided AV valve to pulmonary trunk, and from left atrium through the left-sided AV valve to VSD, outlet chamber (right ventricle), and aorta; and (3) avoid damage to coronary arteries by placing all sutures from within the ventricle. As McGoon and colleagues emphasized, position of the suture line is predetermined by anatomy of the tension apparatuses of the AV valves posteriorly and inferiorly and by location of semilunar valves and VSD superiorly.M5 Therefore, only anteriorly can the surgeon select the suture siting in an attempt to partition the ventricle equally.

Pledgeted 2-0 polyester mattress sutures are placed and held individually by small hemostatic forceps. The most difficult area is the heavily trabeculated diaphragmatic surface. Suturing is begun here, if necessary invaginating the ventricular wall with a finger outside the heart as the stitches are placed. Suture placement is then carried posteriorly and superiorly between the tension apparatuses of right-sided and left-sided AV valves. Starting again at the diaphragmatic surface, suture placement is carried to the left and anteriorly and then superiorly along the anterior left ventricular wall along the previously determined line. The suture line passes over the VSD and then swings posteriorly and to the right beneath the subpulmonary area (see Fig. 56-19, *A-B*). Sutures must be placed close together; 20 to 30 sutures are usually required. As they are individually clamped and set aside, care is taken to maintain their proper order. Alternatively, a running suture can be used.M4

Size and shape of the previously trimmed patch are inspected and altered if needed. Sutures are passed through the patch, the patch slid into position, and the sutures tied. If a two-stage approach is used, the hole in the patch is made at this time (Fig. 56-20). If the right-sided AV valve has been incised, it is repaired with continuous 6-0 polypropylene sutures (see Fig. 55-15 in Chapter 55).

Cardiac reperfusion is begun, and remainder of procedure is completed as described previously (see "Completing Cardiopulmonary Bypass" in Section III of Chapter 2). A groove or indentation can usually now be seen in the ventricular wall along part of the suture line. Two temporary right atrial and two temporary ventricular epicardial wires are placed, and AV sequential pacing is begun. Usual de-airing procedures are carried out (see "De-airing the Heart" in Section III of Chapter 2).

After hemostasis has been secured, two permanent pacing electrodes are placed on the right atrium and two on the ventricle. Their ends are brought subcutaneously into the right upper quadrant, and in most patients an appropriate pacemaker is inserted a day or two later (see "Permanent Pacing after Intracardiac Surgery" under Technique of Intervention in Section I of Chapter 16).

# Cardiac Transplantation

Cardiac transplantation can usually be accomplished, no matter how complex the coexisting venous and arterial anomalies (see Technique of Operation in Chapter 21).M2

# Procedures for Subaortic Obstruction

Operations designed to address subaortic stenosis are detailed in Chapter 41. Arguments have been developed both in favor of routinely addressing real or potential subaortic stenosis using the DKS anastomosis, Norwood procedure, or rarely the arterial switch in the neonatal period, and in favor of selective use of neonatal pulmonary artery banding with early follow-up and surgical management of subaortic stenosis, if and when it develops.H3,I1,J1,J2,K1,S6,T2,W2

If subaortic stenosis is to be surgically approached by direct VSD enlargement, an incision is made in the free wall of the incomplete ventricular chamber. This exposes the VSD, aortic valve, and internal dimensions of the incomplete ventricle. From this perspective, the conduction pathway is always posterior and inferior in relation to the VSD (Fig. 56-21), regardless of whether the heart is L-looped or D-looped. Based on this relationship, the VSD is enlarged as depicted in Figs. 56-22 to 56-24. The ventriculotomy is always closed with a patch (see Fig. 56-24).

# SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

# Fontan Operation

Care after a Fontan-type procedure is discussed under Special Features of Postoperative Care in Section IV of Chapter 41.

#### Septation Operation

Usual protocols are followed postoperatively (see Chapter 5). Following septation, right atrial pressure is usually a few mmHg higher than left and should be maintained around 12 to 14 mmHg in the early hours after operation.

#### Other Operations

Special features of postoperative care after pulmonary trunk banding, atrial septectomy, shunting operations, and operations for subaortic stenosis are described in Chapter 41.

# RESULTS

#### Fontan Operation

Results of the Fontan operation are discussed in detail under Results in Section IV of Chapter 41. Note, however, that several studies have examined the effect of ventricular hypertrophy on outcome following the Fontan operation. In those

Positions of atrioventricular (AV) node and bundle of His are shown by dashed lines. Note that AV node is anterior, in the right atrial wall at the junction of right atrial roof and atrial septum. The bundle of His penetrates the junction of right AV valve and pulmonary valve to pass over subpulmonary area along anterior left ventricular free wall. **B,** As viewed through right atrium, as it passes along the interventricular septum, it courses anterior to ventricular septal defect (VSD) (or outlet foramen), as seen from this perspective, and divides into left and right bundle branches (see Figs. 56-20 to 56-23 to appreciate the posterior relationship of conduction system to the VSD when viewed from the perspective of an incision in the free wall of the incomplete ventricle). Septation operation usually results in heart block when performed in one stage. Dots indicate suture placement for inserting septation patch.

studies, the populations were either predominantly or exclusively patients with double inlet left ventricle with subaortic obstruction. Ventricular hypertrophy was shown to be a risk factor for death and poor outcome at and following the Fontan operation, and attempted relief of subaortic stenosis at the time of, or anytime following, the Fontan operation was attended by an increased risk of death at the time of the procedure.A1,C4,R8

# Septation Operation

# *Early (Hospital) Death*

In a 1984 report, overall hospital mortality after septation operation was high, about 30% to 40%S14 (Table 56-5). However, among patients with moderate enlargement of the left ventricular main chamber without concomitant AV valve replacement or an extracardiac conduit, hospital mortality has been about 5%, but confidence limits are wide (Table 56-6 and Fig. 56-25). In a more recent report (1997), overall hospital mortality was less than 10%.N1 In the series by Margossian and colleagues, 2 of 11 (18%; CL 6.3%-38%) patients died. One death occurred in a two-stage repair that included an arterial switch, and the other in a one-stage repair. This improvement may reflect general progress in the field but may also be influenced by patient selection.

# *Time-Related Survival*

So few patients have survived the early postoperative period after septation operation that estimates of long-term survival have wide CLs, but intermediate survival is reported to be about 60% when all deaths, including those in hospital, are accounted for (see Fig. 56-25).M7 Remarkably, the single slowly declining hazard function is low after about 5 years. In a more recent study of a 23-patient experience, midterm follow-up (3-11 years) showed an overall survival of 78%.N1 In the 11-patient series of Margossian and colleagues, there was one late death with median follow-up of 2.3 years, with survival documented up to 8 years.M4 There are two singlepatient case reports of survival of 9 and 12.5 years.N2,O3

# *Modes of Death*

Hospital deaths have usually been in acute heart failure, and late deaths sudden or after reoperation (usually for AV valve replacement).M7

# *Incremental Risk Factors for Death*

Within the group that currently is considered for septation (double inlet left ventricle, ventricular L-loop, left-sided incomplete right ventricle with VA discordant connection, atrial situs solitus), no risk factors have been identified. However, unusual forms of double inlet ventricle, a small ventricular main chamber, concomitant AV valve replacement, and placement of a valved extracardiac conduit have been risk factors.M7 Aside from morphologic factors, increasing age and ventricular hypertrophy have been identified as risk factors.N1

# *Functional Status*

Functional status is generally good after septation. This might be expected from the experimental study by Seki, Tsakiris, and McGoon, which showed no demonstrable detrimental hemodynamic effect of replacing the dog's ventricular septum (and tricuspid valve) with a prosthesis.S5 It is also supported

No patients with atrial situs inversus had septation; cases are with or without pulmonary stenoses.

One patient, who lived after operation in 1983, had ventricular L-loop, essentially AV and VA discordant connections with essentially two ventricles, an absent septum, right-sided LV morphology, and left-sided RV morphology; another patient, who also lived after operation in 1983, had ventricular D-loop, essentially AV and VA concordant connections with essentially two ventricles, an absent septum, right-sided RV morphology, and left-sided LV morphology (common ventricle); the other three patients had an indeterminate, primitive ventricle.

by detailed hemodynamic study of two patients late after septation by Shimazaki and colleagues.S8 In one patient 8 years post-septation, both right and left ventricular ejection fractions were normal, as was hemodynamic response to exercise. Kurosawa and colleagues found cardiac indices to be higher after septation than after a Fontan operation.K8

However, late after a septation or Fontan operation, cardiorespiratory function by objective measurements at rest and during exercise is depressed compared with normal.D3 Evidence is contradictory as to whether septation provides better cardiorespiratory function than the Fontan operation. In one study, objectively measured postoperative exercise tolerance, compared with that preoperatively, was more improved after the Fontan operation than after septation,D3 but in a later study, superior cardiorespiratory function was found after septation.O1 In a more recent study of double inlet left ventricle patients comparing Fontan or septation, septation patients with native AV valves demonstrated superior cardiopulmonary response to exercise compared with either Fontan patients or septation patients with prosthetic AV valves.O2

#### *Heart Block*

Complete heart block is not inevitable after septation. It occurred after most septation operations in one series from 1982.M7 However, in a series from 2002, only 1 of 11 patients (9.1%; CL 1.5%-28%) developed it.M4 The difference may be that a running suture technique was used in the series with a low occurrence of heart block, rather than interrupted pledgeted mattress sutures that penetrate deeper into the myocardium.

#### Cardiac Transplantation

Results of cardiac transplantation are discussed in detail under Results in Section II of Chapter 21.

#### Other Operations

Results for systemic–pulmonary artery shunts, pulmonary trunk banding, operations to relieve systemic outflow obstruction, coarctation repair, atrial septectomy, bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis, and hemi-Fontan are reported in Chapter 41.

# Outcome Related to Specific Morphology

In a multicenter analysis of 150 patients with double inlet left ventricle who were younger than 3 months of age at diagnosis, overall survival was 88% at 1 month and 76% at 10 years. By multivariable analysis, the only risk factor for premature death was a neonatal operation of any kind.T3

Outcome for the Fontan in double inlet left ventricle patients is excellent, with a 3% early mortality in patients operated on after 1989, and 20-year actuarial survival of about 70% in one large series.E4

Pass and colleagues reported a series of bulboventricular foramen (VSD) enlargement for systemic outflow obstruction in eight patients, five with S,L,L double inlet left ventricle and three with left AV valve atresia. Patients ranged in age from 2 months to 27 years. There was one early and one late death. Gradient relief was complete initially in seven, with one persistent gradient. Two patients developed recurrent obstruction following initial complete relief. All three patients

**Figure 56-26** Survival after Fontan procedure for various double and single inlet ventricle patients. Survival at 10 years was 95% for patients with double inlet right ventricle (DIRV), 100% for those with double inlet left ventricle (DILV), 75% for those with single inlet left ventricle (SILV), and 51% for those with single inlet right ventricle (SIRV) (*P*[log-rank] = .002). (Modified from Kawahira and colleagues.K2)

with recurrent or persistent gradients underwent reoperation with relief of the gradient. At mean follow-up of 22 months, all patients were unobstructed. One patient in the series developed new-onset heart block; there was no new-onset aortic regurgitation.P3

Clarke and colleagues reported a 4% early mortality for interval DKS operation in a series of 15 S,L,L double inlet left ventricle patients initially managed as neonates with pulmonary artery banding and arch reconstruction.C3 These excellent results are more expected in a favorable population of patients that did not have severe neonatal obstruction of the bulboventricular foramen. In contrast, Lan and colleagues noted a higher mortality when the DKS operation was performed in neonates, as did Lotto and colleagues for the Norwood operation in neonates.L1,L5

Kawahira and colleagues reported on a series of 31 double inlet right ventricle patients. Compared with patients having double inlet left ventricle and common inlet ventricle, the prevalence of pulmonary atresia and discontinuous pulmonary arteries was higher in double inlet right ventricle, resulting in more frequent systemic-to–pulmonary artery shunt procedures in this subgroup. Overall outcomes for double inlet right ventricle were similar to those for double inlet left ventricle, however, and were superior to outcomes for common inlet ventricleK2 (Fig. 56-26).

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Primary considerations in managing patients with double inlet ventricle of any type are first and foremost assessment of, and correction of, important neonatal and infant hemodynamic abnormalities, using the palliative operations described in this chapter. Thereafter, considerations become (1) patients' suitability for septation, Fontan operation, or cardiac transplantation and (2) preventing additional

complicating conditions such as subaortic stenosis or pulmonary arterial stenoses.

# Fontan Operation

All patients suitable for septation are suitable for a Fontan operation (except those with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance). Some 70% to 80% of patients with various types of double inlet ventricle or atretic AV valve appear at birth to be suitable at a later date,F4 but nearly 50% of those become unsuitable by about age 2 years (Fig. 56-27). Thus, when in early life a Fontan operation is considered feasible and advisable, an appropriate staged surgical management approach as outlined in Chapter 41 is planned.

# Septation Operation

In the past, a septation operation was considered the most desirable of the three if intracardiac morphology was suitable. However, outcomes following the Fontan operation have improved markedly; currently, Fontan operation is generally considered the procedure of choice, possibly even in many cases with suitable morphology for septation.

Apparently, 20% to 25% of patients born with double inlet ventricle are suitable at birth for septation.F4 By 2 years of age, 30% of those with the malformation are either dead or no longer suitable for septation, and this proportion increases as time passes (Fig. 56-28). A common reason for *developed* lack of suitability is subaortic stenosis.F4

To be suitable for septation, the patient must have a somewhat, but not severely, enlarged dominant ventricle (Fig. 56-29) into which enter two reasonably competent and nonstenotic AV valves with little or no overriding or straddling.F4,M7,P1,S14 Success with a single common AV valve has been reported.K8 The VA connection must be concordant with the AV valve connections projected for the septated ventricle. There should be little or no pulmonary or systemic outflow obstruction.

Because of the age-related declining proportion of patients suitable for septation, resulting from the adverse effect of increasing hypertrophy of the dominant (main) chamber, and

the strong tendency for development of pulmonary vascular disease unless there is natural or produced (by banding) pulmonary stenosis, septation should be performed during the first year or two of life. Consideration should be given to a two-stage approach to minimize the probability of producing complete heart block (see "Staged Septation" under Special Situations and Controversies).

#### Cardiac Transplantation

At birth, 25% to 30% of patients are already unsuitable for either septation or a Fontan operation.F3 Only about 30% survive the first year of life (Fig. 56-30). The place of cardiac transplantation is arguable for this group of patients, but if

Depiction is as in Fig. 56-14. (From Franklin and colleagues.F4)

anything is to be done for them, transplantation would appear to be appropriate. It should be performed in the first month if possible (see "Indications for Cardiac Transplantation" in Section II of Chapter 21).

#### Therapeutic Plan in Older Patients

Some patients come for decision making and therapy after infancy, frequently after various palliative procedures. Each case represents a special situation, but some guidelines can be followed.

Unless pulmonary trunk banding has been performed, septation is often contraindicated because of pulmonary vascular disease, severe ventricular hypertrophy, or AV valve regurgitation. Fontan operation is possible when AV valve regurgitation has developed in one of two valves, but at Fontan operation, or as a separate preliminary operation, the valve needs to be perfectly repaired or closed (see "Closure of the Right Atrioventricular Valve" under Technique of Operation earlier in this chapter).M8

If pulmonary trunk banding was performed in early life, probability of subaortic stenosis is considerable. It should be suspected, even if no gradient is demonstrable, if the VSD is small or only moderate sized. If subaortic stenosis is severe, consideration should be given to treating this before undertaking the Fontan operationN4 In this setting, direct enlargement of the VSD is a better option than in neonates, but the DKS anastomosis or arterial switch operation can still be considered.

# SPECIAL SITUATIONS AND CONTROVERSIES

#### Staged Septation

Ebert reported a two-stage approach to septation in a subset of patients.E2 At the first stage, performed in infancy, a partially septating patch was placed at the apex of the ventricle and a second superiorly between the AV valves, using widely spaced interrupted sutures. A pulmonary trunk band was placed. Septation was completed with a third patch 6 to 18 months later. The other patches were by then completely sealed into position. The band was removed. All patients survived, and all were in sinus rhythm. Margossian and colleagues have also reported success with this approach,M4 as have McKay and colleagues.M6
