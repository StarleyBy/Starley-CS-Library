#### DEFINITION

Atrial isomerism is a condition in which the right-sided and left-sided atria, normally morphologically different, are morphologically similar.1 Thus, left atrial isomerism and right atrial isomerism can occur. Atrial isomerism is a specific phenotypic feature highly associated with generalized somatic laterality disorders characterized by abnormal arrangement of thoracic and abdominal viscera, including important structural cardiovascular anomalies. The terms *situs ambiguus* and *heterotaxy* are used to describe these laterality disorders. Attempts to classify specific constellations of the many clinical and phenotypic features that can occur with heterotaxy have resulted in descriptive terms such as *asplenia syndrome* and *polysplenia syndrome*. V2 Experience shows that although there is some tendency for certain constellations to occur, exceptions are frequent or even the rule. About 3% of all congenital heart anomalies occur in the context of heterotaxy.S10 The various cardiac anomalies found in heterotaxy are shown in Table 58-1. C4

In this chapter, individual cardiovascular anomalies and commonly recognized constellations of cardiovascular anomalies that occur with heterotaxy are discussed. These complex associations are analyzed from a perspective that uses left

The adjectives *left* and *right* used to modify atrium or ventricle mean *morphologically* left or right. *Position* of a chamber or valve is referred to as *right-sided* or *left-sided*.

## HISTORICAL NOTE

Anomalies of right and left sidedness related to asymmetry of the body were recognized at least by the 15th century with Leonardo da Vinci's drawing of situs inversus. In the early 17th century, Marco Aurelio Severino described this anatomic variant, but it was Matthew Baille, a student of John Hunter, who is credited with scientifically describing anomalies of sidedness and their associated lesions in the latter part of the 18th century.B1 In 1933 Kartagener drew attention to the association of situs inversus with sinusitis (Kartagener syndrome), providing an important clue to the possible morphogenesis of all anomalies of sidedness,K1 although this had been suggested by Siewert in 1904.S6 Biorn Ivemark in 1955 identified the syndrome of right atrial isomerism, asplenia, symmetry of thoracic organs, and conotruncal anomalies during his studies at Children's Hospital Boston.I2

Subsequently, general interest in the asymmetry of many bilateral animals, from snails to humans (the science related to chiral [asymmetric] bodies), has led to the hypothesis that left-right patterning is related to genetic factor processes that become reflected in midline left-right ciliary structure and function during embryogenesis.O1,S10 In the 1986 first edition of this book, Kirklin presented the UAB surgical experience with heterotaxy patients, consisting of 28 complete repairs and 28 palliative operations (including two Fontan operations).

#### *Atrial Isomerism*

In atrial isomerism, both atria have similar internal, external, and appendage configuration. They are considered either morphologically bilaterally right atria or bilaterally left atria.M6,R4,V2 Validity of the concept of atrial isomerism, at least from the perspective of the purist, has been questioned.C4,V3

Atrial situs is most usefully determined by morphology of the atrial appendages,C1,M1,S4 because all other studies provide indirect information. Right atrial appendage morphology is present when the appendage is blunt and has a broad junction with a smooth-walled atrium. This type of junction is accompanied by protrusion of the crista terminalis into the atrial cavity.M1 Left atrial appendage morphology is present when the atrial appendage is long and thin with constrictions along its length. Such appendages have a rather constricted junction with a smooth atrium, within which a crista terminalis is not identifiable.M1 Rarely, atria and their appendages have mixed right and left atrial morphology.

Atrial isomerism (right or left) commonly corresponds to thoracic isomerism; however, disharmony between atrial

morphology and pulmonary and bronchial morphology occurs.C1,P5,S4,U1 Atrial and thoracic isomerism (i.e., bilateral atrial and thoracic right- or left-sidedness) usually corresponds to bilateral right-sidedness (asplenia) or left-sidedness (polysplenia) of the abdominal viscera, but there are exceptions to this correspondence.L2,U1 Abdominal asplenia or polysplenia may occasionally exist without atrial isomerism, so splenic state does not always predict atrial morphology.S5 Because of this variability, Anderson prefers the term *heterotaxy* to denote presence of any of the numerous possible lateralization abnormalities, and then recommends describing the morphologic details for each patient.A2

Among 58 consecutive newborn cases of heterotaxy within a single institution, 25 had asplenia and 20 had polysplenia.L6 In surgical series, left atrial isomerism is more common than right, in one surgical experience with 41 patients, 23 had left and 18 had right atrial isomerism.S7 Several heterotaxy studies performed in Asian populations show a strong predilection (80% of cases) for right atrial isomerism, suggesting there may be racial differences in the expression of left and right atrial isomerism.L5,Y1

#### *Conduction System*

Right atrial isomerism is usually accompanied by bilateral sinus nodes, one in each atrium.B3,D3,V2 Two atrioventricular (AV) nodes may be present, with a sling of conduction tissue between them. In left atrial isomerism, the sinus node is absent in the majority of cases, but when present is unusually positioned and often hypoplastic.H5

The AV node may be normally situated when ventricular architecture is right-handed (D-loop); when it is left-handed (L-loop), two AV nodes and a sling may be present.D3 Other more severe conduction system abnormalities may also be present, because complete heart block occurs in some neonates with left atrial isomerism.G1,H4,M5

Supraventricular atrial tachycardias occur in right atrial isomerism in up to 25% of patients, whereas abnormal axis P waves with slow atrial or junctional rates are the rule in left atrial isomerism.W3

#### *Anomalies of Systemic Venous Connection*

Anomalies of systemic venous connection are common. The inferior vena cava often does not connect directly to the atrium from below, but instead passes superiorly along the right-sided paravertebral gutter (azygos extension of inferior vena cava) or left-sided gutter (hemiazygos extension of inferior vena cava), emptying into a right-sided or leftsided superior vena cavaU2 (Table 58-2). Azygos extension of the inferior vena cava occurs exclusively in patients with left atrial isomerism, in whom it occurs in about 75% of cases (see Table 58-2).

Data from Uemura and colleagues.U2 *a* Via central confluence.

Bilateral superior venae cavae occur frequently: in half of patients with right atrial isomerism and in two thirds of patients with left atrial isomerismU2 (Table 58-3). When present, each typically connects to the top corner of the corresponding atrium; however, in left atrial isomerism, one may connect to the coronary sinus.M1

When the inferior vena cava connects directly to the atria from below, it may connect to either the left- or right-sided atrium (see Table 58-2). Hepatic veins connect directly to the atria from below, usually to one atrium but sometimes to both or to both sides of a common atrium.M1 Such a direct hepatic vein connection is present in all patients with an azygos extension of the inferior vena cava, but it also occurs in patients whose inferior vena cava connects to the atria from below (Table 58-4).

Uemura and colleagues report that the coronary sinus orifice is absent in about 40% of patients with left and in 100% of patients with right atrial isomerism.U1 Other series, however, show substantial variation from these percentages.P2,P4,V3 Anomalies of systemic venous connection do not occur exclusively in patients with atrial isomerism.M4

## *Anomalies of Pulmonary Venous Connection*

Extracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) is usually seen in patients with right atrial isomerism (Table 58-5). When pulmonary veins connect to an atrium, pattern of connection is variable. Importantly, there is usually the normal wide area of posterior atrial wall between the pulmonary veins when the heart is viewed from behind.M1 Pulmonary venous obstruction may be present in up to 40% of patients with right atrial isomerism, especially when the connection is extracardiac.C3,H2,R3 Pulmonary venous obstruction in left atrial isomerism is much less common.H2 Atresia of the common pulmonary vein has been reported in right atrial isomerism.D1

#### *Atrioventricular Connections*

About 75% of patients with left atrial isomerism have biventricular AV connections that are ambiguous.C3,D2 However, there is a univentricular AV connection in about 50% to 75% of patients with right atrial isomerism, a considerably higher percentage than in any other type of atrial situs, and most of these patients have a solitary ventricular chamberC3,H3,S7,U1 (Table 58-6).

## *Atrioventricular Septal and Other Atrial Septal Defects*

The complexities of pulmonary and systemic venous connections, variability in the position and nature of AV valves through which the atria empty, and anomalous muscle bands that sometimes traverse the atria often make it difficult to apply conventional terms describing atrial septal defects (ASDs). However, a common atrium (see "Common Atrium"

under Morphology in Chapter 34) is present in nearly half the cases.P4,S3 AV septal defect is present in about 80% of patients, with a higher prevalence in right than in left atrial isomerismH3 (see Table 58-6). Most patients with atrial isomerism and AV septal defects have a common AV orifice (see "Complete Atrioventricular Septal Defect" under Morphology in Chapter 34) rather than two AV valve orifices. Rarely the atrial septum is well formed and intact or has only a probe-patent foramen ovale.P4,S3

## *Ventricular Morphology and Ventricular Septal Defects*

Complexities of AV valves and connections and frequent occurrence of solitary ventricular chambers make it difficult to apply conventional terms. Only rarely is the ventricular septum intact; about 80% of patients with a VSD have an AV septal defect, and in the remainder with intact AV septal structures, various types of VSD are present.

#### *Pulmonary Outflow*

Unobstructed pulmonary outflow is rare in right, but more frequent in left, atrial isomerism. In right atrial isomerism, pulmonary stenosis is present in slightly more than half of patients, and pulmonary atresia in about one third. In left atrial isomerism, pulmonary stenosis is present in about half and pulmonary atresia in less than one tenthH3 (see Table 58-6).

## *Ventriculoarterial Connections*

In surgical series, ventriculoarterial connections are most commonly discordant, and an unusually high proportion (33%) of patients have double outlet right ventricle.R2 In autopsy series, about 75% to 90% of specimens with right atrial isomerism have discordant ventriculoarterial connection (transposition) or double outlet right ventricle; in left atrial isomerism, this is true in about 20% to 65% of specimensH3,P4,S7 (see Table 58-6). In some cases, such as double outlet from an indeterminate ventricle, the ventriculoarterial connection cannot be easily characterized.

## *Other Coexisting Cardiac Anomalies*

Anomalies other than those inherent in atrial isomerism are infrequent in surgically treated patients. In autopsy series, obstructive lesions on the left side of the heart, excluding left ventricular hypoplasia and mitral stenosis, are common.P2

#### *Summary*

In the surgically more common left atrial isomerism, anomalies of systemic venous connection are common, as are abortive forms of cor triatriatum, but extracardiac TAPVCs are not. Common atrium and other types of AV septal defects occur in about half the cases. Univentricular AV connections are uncommon, as are solitary ventricular chambers, but double outlet right ventricle is common. Pulmonary stenosis is present in about half of cases.

In surgical patients with right atrial isomerism, anomalies of systemic venous connection are less common, as are abortive forms of cor triatriatum, but extracardiac forms of TAPVC occur more frequently. Common atrium and other forms of AV septal defect occur in more than 90% of patients, and solitary ventricular chamber occurs in nearly half. The fact that cardiac anomalies are more complex and numerous in hearts with right rather than left atrial isomerism probably explains the higher prevalence of left atrial isomerism in surgical series than in autopsy series.

## Morphogenesis

The genetic basis of heterotaxy is thought to be related to genetics of ciliary dysfunction on the embryologic midline node.C4

## CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

There are no clinical features absolutely specific to atrial isomerism, because there is no specific functional derangement uniformly associated with the atrial morphology. The clinical sign most intimately related to the atrial morphology itself is presence of abnormal P-wave morphology and slow atrial rhythm associated with left atrial isomerism. Asplenia, commonly associated with right atrial isomerism, is associated with an increased number of Howell-Jolly bodies in the routine blood smear in newborns, or persistent Howell-Jolly bodies in older infants. Clinical features depend, therefore, on the specific cardiac anomalies and the many possible noncardiac anomalies and disorders that may be present, including intestinal malrotation, absence of splenic function, primary ciliary dyskinesia, biliary atresia, central nervous system anomalies, craniofacial anomalies, intraabdominal vascular anomalies such as congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and musculoskeletal anomalies.C4,N5,S10

Atrial situs is best diagnosed preoperatively by determining thoracic situs, because atrial and thoracic situs are nearly always the same.P1,S8,V1 Thoracic situs is best indicated by bronchial anatomy, which does not always correspond to

lung lobulation.L2,L3,V1 The length of each mainstem bronchus and its relationship to its respective pulmonary artery provide the most reliable clinical prediction of thoracic situs.L1,P1,S5 The normal right mainstem bronchus is relatively short, and the right pulmonary artery is anterior and inferior to the bronchus; the normal left mainstem bronchus is relatively long, and the left pulmonary artery is posterior and superior to the bronchus.

Determining these relationships, and thus diagnosis of thoracic situs, is reliably accomplished from plain frontal and lateral chest radiographs, although meticulous attention must be paid to radiologic technique.B4,P1,S8 If the ratio of the length of the shorter (normally right) bronchus divided by that of the longer (normally the left) is 2 or greater, there is thoracic lateralization; if the ratio is 1.5 or less, thoracic and usually atrial isomerism is present. Also, right isomerism is usually present when each pulmonary artery is anterior to its respective bronchus; left isomerism is usually present when each pulmonary artery is superior and posterior to its respective bronchus (Fig. 58-1).

Prenatal diagnosis of heterotaxy can often be made by echocardiography, but prenatal diagnosis has no impact on survival.C5,P3 Echocardiography after birth can reliably identify the typical constellations of morphologic abnormalities associated with both left and right atrial isomerism and as a result can strongly suggest the diagnosisH7 (Figs. 58-2 and 58-3). Echocardiography, however, is limited in delineating all morphologic details related to atrial isomerism, particularly when complex pulmonary artery and pulmonary venous anomalies are present (e.g., pulmonary atresia with discontinuous branch pulmonary arteries, mixed TAPVC). Specific characteristics of the atrial appendages cannot usually be identified with certainty, and the relationship of bronchi to pulmonary arteries cannot be determined. Complex pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein anomalies, and the extracardiac thoracic and abdominal features of left and right atrial isomerism, can best be determined by computed tomography and cineangiography (Figs. 58-4 and 58-5). Specific hemodynamic data can only be obtained by cardiac catheterization.

Almost all children with *right* atrial isomerism are in sinus rhythm, and most have a normal P-wave axis.W1 Complete AV block coexists in about 10% of patients with *left* atrial isomerism but is rare in right atrial isomerism.W1

At operation, the surgeon must make direct observations of the atrial appendages and atrial walls to confirm or deny the preoperative diagnosis of right or left atrial isomerism.

**Figure 58-2** Atrial isomerism with asplenia (probably bilateral right-sidedness). Echocardiography can reliably identify most cardiovascular defects associated with the various atrial isomerism (heterotaxy) syndromes. Because the constellation of findings is variable and complex, multiple echocardiographic views are required. This subcostal coronal view demonstrates enlarged atrial chamber. Almost complete absence of atrial septum is evident, with only a central band present. There is a large ostium primum defect and a large ostium secundum defect. The single atrioventricular valve and ventricular mass are also seen. Key: *AS,* Atrial septum; *ASD1,* ostium primum defect; *ASD2,* secundum atrial septal defect; *V,* ventricle.

## NATURAL HISTORY

Natural history of patients with atrial isomerism is determined primarily by details of cardiac structures and nature of coexisting cardiac anomalies. However, atrial isomerism itself may contribute to natural history because of its association with neonatal complete heart block and sometimes neonatal death.G1,M5

Right atrial isomerism is often accompanied by asplenia, a condition believed to render the patient susceptible to infection, particularly pneumococcal. Left atrial isomerism is often accompanied by polysplenia and a high prevalence of extrahepatic biliary atresiaC2,D5; the polysplenia is also accompanied by splenic incompetence.

## TECHNIQUE OF OPERATION

## Cardiopulmonary Bypass

In patients with atrial isomerism, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) often presents venous cannulation problems because of systemic venous anomalies. Basic venous cannulation techniques are used, as well as those for situations involving three venae cavae (see "Venous Cannulation" under Preparation for Cardiopulmonary Bypass and "Left Superior Vena Cava" under Special Situations and Controversies in Section III of Chapter 2). Direct caval cannulation is particularly advantageous because of complex intraatrial repairs that are often required.

In patients with left atrial isomerism and two superior venae cavae, it must be remembered in selecting venous cannula size that one of the superior cavae is probably returning the entire inferior vena caval flow by way of the azygos continuation as well as its usual flow, and that a larger than usual cannula is required. In such situations, blood returning from hepatic veins connected directly to an atrium is picked up by a pump-oxygenator sump-sucker placed in the depths of the atrium. The hepatic veins, especially if they become confluent before entering the atrium, may also be directly cannulated. Occasionally, patients with right atrial isomerism will have bilateral superior venae cavae as well as hepatic veins that drain to the atrium separate from the inferior vena cava; in this situation, four venous cannulae may be necessary.

In all of these situations, complexity of the cannulation arrangement (and accompanying complexity of the intracardiac repair in many cases) is such that cooling to moderate to deep hypothermia (20°C-24°C) and using aortic clamping and cold cardioplegia are advised to allow maximum visibility and flexibility of the perfusion flow rate. For example, if a complex atrial baffle is required, one or more of the multiple venous cannulae may be temporarily removed and replaced with a cardiotomy suction device to enhance visibility and ensure the baffle is placed without distortion.

One solution to the venous cannulation problem is to use hypothermic circulatory arrest, cooling and rewarming the patient with a single venous cannula through an atrial appendage. (Advantages and disadvantages of this technique are described in Section IV of Chapter 2.) This method is more likely to be chosen for infants.

#### Intracardiac Repair

A wide variety of intracardiac repairs are required in patients with atrial isomerism, and repair in individual patients may require two or three procedures. These are described under Technique of Operation in chapters on the specific anomaly encountered. Procedures used in repair of AV septal defects, including common atrium (see Technique of Operation in Chapter 34), are particularly important.

## Complex Atrial Baffle

In repairing anomalies of pulmonary or systemic venous connections that are frequently part of the cardiac anomaly, a complex atrial baffle is often required. The first step is usually excising remnants of the atrial septum, except for the anterior limbus, which, if present, may contain the AV node or bundle of His. The temptation to retain part of the septum as a flap should generally be resisted because it tends to increase complexity. When a coronary sinus is present, it is usually cut down, as in the Senning or Mustard repair (see Fig. 52-32 in Chapter 52).

Fig. 58-6 shows a complete AV septal defect with bilateral superior vena cavae, interrupted inferior vena cava with azygos continuation to the right superior vena cava, and two separate hepatic venous connections. Spatial arrangements of the orifices of the pulmonary veins, left-sided superior vena cava in the upper left corner of the atrium, right-sided superior vena cava in the upper right atrial corner, and hepatic

C

veins lying inferiorly must be visualized in three dimensions and clearly understood (Fig. 58-6, *A*). Also, the superior vena cava receiving venous drainage from the lower body must be recognized as requiring a larger pathway to the AV valve than usual if flow is to be unimpeded. The relationship of these orifices to left-sided and right-sided AV valves must be clarified, because proper positioning of the atrial baffle depends on this knowledge. Presence of an intact inferior vena cava with separate hepatic venous drainage to the atrium, not shown in this figure, would add further complexity.

right ventricle; *SVC,* superior vena cava; *VSD,* ventricular septal

defect.

In planning the baffle and potential drainage pathways to AV valves, ventriculoarterial connections that will exist at the end of the repair must also be clearly visualized. In this regard, the ventricular situs (handedness or loop) per se is not important, because in what will ultimately be a twoventricle system, pulmonary venous return must be routed to the ventricle that does (or will) connect to the aorta, regardless of whether it is morphologically right or left. Similarly, systemic venous return must be routed to the ventricle connected to the pulmonary trunk.

After these structures and relationships have been visualized clearly, the proposed suture line of the baffle is marked with four to six interrupted suture markers, and the pericardium that was taken initially and set aside is trimmed to a proper shape and size and sutured into place (Fig. 58-6, *B*). This complex atrial baffle is similar to that used for repair of simple unroofed coronary sinus syndrome (see Fig. 33-3 in Chapter 33).

Frequent association of anomalies of venous connection with AV septal defects in patients with atrial isomerism often necessitates combining baffle repair with repair of a complete AV septal defect. In such a procedure, extension of the atrial baffle toward the AV valves is best thought of as simply the intraatrial portion of the two-patch technique used in the repair of complete AV septal defects (see "Two-Patch Technique" under Technique of Operation in Chapter 34).

Techniques have been developed that reduce complexity of the atrial baffle in some circumstances. When bilateral superior venae cavae are present with unroofed coronary sinus, extracardiac connection of the left to the right superior

The large tortuous shunt is seen extending from the midsplenic vein to the right renal vein at its junction with inferior vena cava–azygos vein junction. The more proximal splenic vein on the right is not filled. There is faint filling of the right renal vein. The portal vein (right branches fill better than left branches) and superior mesenteric vein are patent. Key: *PV,* Portal vein; *RV,* right renal vein; *SMV,* superior mesenteric vein; *SV,* midsplenic vein. (From Newman and colleagues.N5)

vena cava can be performed, making partitioning of a common atrium much simpler.R1

## Fontan Type of Repair

Frequent occurrence of complex cardiac anomalies means that a Fontan type of repair must sometimes be used. Usual techniques of operation as practiced in the current era (see Technique of Operation in Section IV of Chapter 41) serve well. In most instances, some form of extracardiac conduit or lateral tunnel total cavopulmonary shunt operation is useful (see "Persistent Left Superior Vena Cava with Hemiazygos Extension of Inferior Vena Cava" under Special Situations and Controversies in Section IV of Chapter 41).K2 Several variations of these basic techniques can be used when the hepatic veins enter the atria separately.N1,N3

#### Atrioventricular Valve Repair

Repair of a common atrioventricular valve is an important consideration in heterotaxy patients with single ventricle physiology. Valve regurgitation is a consistently cited risk factor for poor outcome (see Results section). Ota and

The entire course of the shunt cannot be seen on a single image. There is partial visualization of a retroaortic right renal vein, also draining to hemiazygos vein.

colleaguesO2 have identified characteristics of valve repair that increase the likelihood of success. Multiple techniques were used, primarily including direct leaflet apposition at clefts, scallops, or prolapsing leaflet edges and various forms of reduction anuloplasty. Additional techniques used were the Alfieri suture and chordal shortening.

## Palliative Operations

Standard techniques are used for shunting procedures (see "Technique of Shunting Operations" under Technique of Operation in Section I of Chapter 38 and "Systemic– Pulmonary Arterial Shunt" under Technique of Operation in Section II of Chapter 41) and pulmonary trunk banding (see "Pulmonary Trunk Banding" under Technique of Operation in Section II of Chapter 41). Coexisting juxtaductal pulmonary arterial stenosis, not uncommon in these patients, should be corrected at the time of the shunting operation. Occasionally, discontinuous branch pulmonary arteries arising from bilateral ductus arteriosus, in association with pulmonary atresia, must be reconstructed at the time of the shunting procedure. In one series, this morphology was present in 7 of 28 patients (25%) having pulmonary atresia with right atrial isomerism.F2

If a superior cavopulmonary shunt is being considered, careful consideration must be given to presence of bilateral superior venae cavae or of interrupted inferior vena cava. Bilateral bidirectional superior cavopulmonary shunts are discussed in Section III of Chapter 41. The considerations are purely technical, with no physiologic implications different from those of unilateral bidirectional superior cavopulmonary shunt. In contrast, creating a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt in the setting of interrupted inferior vena cava has important physiologic implications. Because of azygos vein continuation associated with interrupted inferior vena cava,

![](_page_8_Picture_2.jpeg)

Baffle should not be redundant but taut, and care is taken to ensure that it does not restrict any pathway.

a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt will deliver all systemic venous return, except for splanchnic blood flow, to the pulmonary circulation. As a result, systemic oxygen saturation and pulmonary artery pressure can both be higher than with a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt in the setting of intact inferior vena cava. There are also long-term physiologic implications as discussed in the text that follows.

#### SPECIAL FEATURES OF POSTOPERATIVE CARE

Usual measures of postoperative care are employed after repair of cardiac anomalies in patients with atrial isomerism (see Chapter 5). Special measures used after the Fontan type of procedure are described under Special Features of Postoperative Care in Section IV of Chapter 41.

When a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt is created in the setting of interrupted inferior vena cava, careful mid- and long-term follow-up is critical to monitor development of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. These pulmonary vascular abnormalities can develop under various conditions of altered pulmonary blood flow, but their development is particularly rapid and aggressive in this setting. The first sign of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations may be decreased Sao<sub>2</sub>, although contrast echocardiography may document arteriovenous malformations well before that. At catheterization, angiographic evidence of arteriovenous malformations

and desaturated blood in the pulmonary veins confirm the diagnosis. There is evidence that incorporating splanchnic venous blood into the pulmonary circulation along with the remainder of systemic venous return may reverse pulmonary arteriovenous malformations.I1,M2,W2

Lack of splenic function in heterotaxy patients increases the risk of nosocomial infection and demands exquisite attention to preoperative sterile technique. In a series of 29 heterotaxy patients, seven (24%; CL 15%-35%) developed sepsis during treatment. Six of the seven were on appropriate antibiotic therapy when sepsis developed. Underscoring the fact that polysplenia patients as well as asplenia patients have splenic dysfunction, five of the seven patients with sepsis had polysplenia. Bacterial sepsis was associated with a 44% mortality.P6

#### RESULTS

Because of wide morphologic variability in patients with atrial isomerism, it is difficult to summarize overall outcomes. However, several general points can be made. First, overall survival is better with left, compared with right, atrial isomerism (94% vs. 79% at 3 years in one series, and 94% vs. 53% at 1 year in another).A3,T1 Second, in most series survival is better when a biventricular repair is undertaken compared with a management plan that leads to a Fontan procedureG2,H1,V4 (Figs. 58-7 and 58-8). In the large series reported by Serraf and colleagues, however, mortality in these two categories was similarS2 (Fig. 58-9). Points one and two above are somewhat related; in all series of heterotaxy, most biventricular repairs are performed in patients with left atrial isomerism morphology. Third, overall results have improved substantially over time, with current-era outcomes suggesting 7% to 15% early mortality, and long-term survival of 75%A1,A3,D4,M3,S2,T2 (Fig. 58-10). In one large series, all mortality beyond that related to initial neonatal management was due to interstage loss in single-ventricle patients.A1

#### Left Atrial Isomerism Outcomes

In left atrial isomerism, several large series suggest that about one third of patients received a biventricular repair.A1,G2 The remainder underwent surgical palliationA1 or did not undergo surgical intervention.G2 Of those not undergoing operation, death was almost certain if important cardiac defects were present. In earlier series, even in patients with normal hearts there was 18% mortality within the first few years of life because of important noncardiac abnormalities,G2 and in those patients undergoing some form of surgical intervention, both short- and long-term outcomes were substantially better in those undergoing biventricular repair (Fig. 58-11; see also Fig. 58-7).G2

In more recent series, patients undergoing surgical palliation have had excellent survival, as have those undergoing biventricular repair, with no differences noted between these two groups.A1 In fact, these recent outcomes in patients

undergoing surgical intervention are substantially better than the 18% mortality in left atrial isomerism patients with normal hearts from older series. Thus, it can be inferred that noncardiac management of heterotaxy patients has also improved. This inference is supported by the fact that noncardiac as well as cardiac risk factors for death were identified in older series (Table 58-7). More recent series show almost no mortality, and understandably: case volumes are small with no identifiable risk factors. Al,V4 One study of 91 biventricular repairs suggests that attempting biventricular repair in the setting of unbalanced AV septal defect is associated with increased mortality. L4

#### Right Atrial Isomerism Outcomes

In right atrial isomerism, both short- and long-term outcomes are worse than for left atrial isomerism. Although outcomes have improved in recent series, they still remain worse than in left atrial isomerism. Al, Risk factors in recent series include presence of AV valve regurgitation, obstructed TAPVC, and mixed TAPVC, similar to those identified in earlier series Al, Fl, N4, Y2 (Table 58-8 and Fig. 58-12). Occurrence of secondary pulmonary vein obstruction after repair of obstructed TAPVC is frequent, adding to the poor prognosis of this association Fl, N4 (Table 58-9). Biventricular repair is possible in few patients with right atrial isomerism (see Fig. 58-7). Hl, L4 In patients not receiving surgical intervention, death is almost a certainty (Fig. 58-13; see also Fig. 58-8).

In patients undergoing surgical palliation, presence of TAPVC requiring operation creates substantial problems in the setting of single-ventricle physiology. The common occurrence of obstructed outflow into the pulmonary circulation and obstructed pulmonary veins makes management of such infants particularly challenging<sup>H1</sup> (see Table 58-8; see also Fig. 58-13).

**Figure 58-13** Survival estimates for patients with right atrial isomerism with no intervention, first surgical intervention during neonatal period, and first surgical intervention after age 4 weeks. Differences in risk for the three groups were unlikely to be due to chance (*P* = .0001) (Wilcoxon and log-rank tests). (From Hashmi and colleagues.H1)

Other series support the observation that biventricular repair, when possible, can be performed with low mortality, that surgery in the neonatal period for pulmonary venous obstruction in combination with outflow obstruction to the pulmonary circulation in right atrial isomerism carries a dismal prognosis, and that outcomes following surgical intervention are generally better in left, compared with right, atrial isomerism.A1,K3,S1,S7

## Fontan Outcomes

In several studies, one multicenter, functional outcome and survival after the Fontan operation were similar in heterotaxy and non-heterotaxy patients.A4,B2,H6,S9 Heterotaxy patients, however, did undergo their procedure at an older age, were more likely to receive an extracardiac conduit Fontan, had more previous operations, had a higher prevalence of sinus node dysfunction and atrial dysrhythmias, and had more AV valve regurgitation.

## Atrioventricular Valve Repair Outcomes

Successful repair can be achieved in two thirds of patientsN2,O2 The technique of leaflet apposition (see "Atrioventricular Valve Repair" under Technique of Operation) was associated with successful repair. Successful repair was associated with improved survival.O2

#### INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION

Need for surgical treatment is dictated by associated cardiac anomalies, not by atrial isomerism. Atrial isomerism, particularly right atrial isomerism and asplenia, strongly suggests the presence of complex cardiac anomalies and a higher-thanusual surgical risk, but coexisting anomalies are usually severe and the natural history unfavorable. Therefore, indications for operation are usually clear.
