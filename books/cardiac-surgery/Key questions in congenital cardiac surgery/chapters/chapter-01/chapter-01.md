- 1 **What are the embryological origins of the components of the definitive heart?**
- The primary and secondary heart fields represent the heart-forming area of the mesodermal layer of the embryonic disc.
- Cardiomyocytes migrate from the primary heart field to produce a linear tube within the pericardial cavity (Figure 1), which is responsible for forming the left ventricle and part of the ventricular septum.

**Figure 1. Scanning electron micrograph of a mouse embryo on the 9th day of development demonstrating an essentially straight linear tube, which is eventually responsible for formation of little more than the definitive left ventricle.**

With ongoing development, new material from the second heart field invades the pericardial cavity at both the venous and arterial poles of the linear tube. This is responsible for formation of the atrioventricular canal and the primary atrial chamber at the venous pole, and the primordium of the right ventricle, along with the outflow tract, at the arterial pole (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Scanning electron micrograph of a mouse embryo during the 10th day of development demonstrating looping of the ventricular component of the linear tube in front of the developing atrial component, produced by ongoing addition of material from the heartforming areas at both the arterial and venous poles. Ballooning from the cavity at the atrial level then produces the atrial appendages (white stars), while ballooning from the ventricular loop produces the apical components of the developing right and left ventricles.

• Ingrowth at both poles results in lengthening of the tube, which contributes to formation of the ventricular loop. Subsequent to looping, the tube retains a solitary lumen, which is lined with endocardial jelly. At this early stage, the entirety of the tube, including the outflow tract, possesses exclusively myocardial walls.

- The cardiomyocytes forming the walls of the tube have their own phenotype and can be recognised as forming primary myocardium. The definitive atrial and ventricular chambers are formed by expansion of pouches from the cavity of the primary tube, with the newly formed walls built from phenotypically different cardiomyocytes, which give rise to secondary, or chamber, myocardium.
- Outpouching or ballooning of the primary atrial chamber occurs in a symmetrical fashion and gives rise to the atrial appendages (Figure 2).
- The ventricular pouches, in contrast, balloon in series, one from the inlet of the ventricular loop, and the other from the outlet (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Episcopic image of a mouse embryo during the 11th day of development demonstrating ballooning of the atrial appendages (large white arrows) in parallel from the atrial component of the primary tube, while the ventricular components are ballooning apically from the inlet and outlet components of the ventricular loop. At this initial stage, the atrioventricular (AV) canal opens exclusively to the inlet part of the loop.

The pouch ballooning from the inlet of the loop will become the apical component of the left ventricle, while the ballooning from the outlet component provides the apical part of the right ventricle. The apical muscular ventricular septum appears concomitant with the formation of the two pouches.

- By the time the ballooning has taken place, the endocardial jelly has itself undergone a process of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transformation, producing cushions in the atrioventricular canal and throughout the outflow tract. These cushions will eventually remodel to become the cardiac valves.
- Additional remodelling within the lumen of the initial primary heart tube then permits the right atrium to gain access to the developing right ventricle by expansion of the atrioventricular canal (Figure 4), with the aorta subsequently being transferred to the left ventricle.

**Figure 4. Episcopic image of a mouse embryo during the 12th day of development demonstrating expansion of the atrioventricular (AV) canal, which permits the right atrium to connect directly with the cavity of the developing right ventricle (large white arrow).**

- Only after this remodelling has taken place is it possible to close the embryonic interventricular communication, thereby completing the separation of the systemic and pulmonary ventricular blood streams.
- 2 **Describe the connection of the atrial chambers with the ventricular mass and the ventricles with the arterial trunks**
- The key part of the analysis of congenitally malformed hearts is to describe the arrangement of the 'segments' (atrial, ventricular and arterial components) and how they are joined together.
- Subsequent to remodelling of the embryonic interventricular communication, the cavities of the atrial chambers are in continuity with those of the underlying ventricles, whilst the cavities of the ventricles are continuous with those of the intrapericardial arterial trunks.
- The walls of the various components, however, are not directly contiguous, due to the presence of 'connecting segments', with atrioventricular canal myocardium interposing between the walls of the atrial segment and the inlet of the ventricular loop, while the proximal part of the outflow tract (conus) is supported exclusively by the developing right ventricle (Figure 5).

![](_page_4_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Figure 5. Episcopic image of a human embryo during the 6th week of development demonstrating the developing atrioventricular junctions and the proximal part of the outflow tract (conus).**

- With ongoing development, the myocardium of the atrioventricular canal becomes incorporated into the atrial chambers, forming the vestibules of the tricuspid and mitral valves.
- The proximal myocardium of the outflow tract (conus) forms the myocardium supporting the arterial roots above their respective ventricles, and is an integral part of the ventricular myocardium.
- Subsequent to these changes, it is possible to recognise the definitive atrioventricular and ventriculo-arterial junctions, which delimit the extent of the ventricular mass.
- Hence, the cavities of the atrial chambers connect with those of the ventricles across the atrioventricular junction, and the chambers of the ventricles are in direct connection with those of the arterial trunks.
- It is less accurate to use the term 'alignments' to describe these features, since the cavities of the atrial and ventricular chambers can be aligned one to the other, as in tricuspid atresia, without being connected (Figure 6).

**Figure 6. Macroscopic image demonstrating alignment of the right atrium with an incomplete right ventricle in a patient with tricuspid atresia but the absence of connection between the atrial and ventricular cavities.**

## 3 **What are heterotaxy and isomerism?**

• Heterotaxy is defined as an abnormal arrangement of the internal thoracic or abdominal organs across the left-right axis of the body. Most complex congenital cardiac lesions are found in hearts with the variant of so-called heterotaxy in which there is evidence, in the thorax, of an isomeric arrangement of all or parts of the organs.

- Isomerism describes the situation in which the right- and left-sided structures within the body are mirror images of each other. The hands are the perfect example of bodily isomerism. In the mirrorimaged arrangement, often described as 'situs inversus', all the organs are lateralised, but are positioned in mirror-imaged fashion compared to the usual arrangement. In the isomeric arrangement, seen best in the thoracic organs, the lungs and bronchi, and the atrial appendages, are mirror images of each other in the same individual.
- Both the isomeric and mirror-imaged variants represent disorders of laterality.
- The right and left sides of the body develop their individual anatomical features in response to genes located on the left side of the developing embryo, such as Cited2 and Pitx2, and which are prevented from reaching the right side by other genes, such as Lefty2 and Sonic hedgehog.
- Within the heart, it is only the atrial appendages that respond in differential fashion to these genes, which explains why only the atrial appendages show evidence of isomerism.
- As emphasised above, the lungs and bronchi are also able to develop in isomeric or mirror-imaged fashion, but this is not the case for the abdominal organs, which can develop in a mirrorimaged or jumbled-up fashion.
- The syndrome currently described by many as 'visceral heterotaxy' is best addressed on the basis of the isomeric arrangement of the lungs, bronchi and atrial appendages, although the isomeric features are not always universally present.
- For appropriate description of the cardiac findings, analysis should begin with establishment of the presence of isomerism, as opposed to usually arranged or mirror-imaged atrial appendages. This should then be followed by full sequential segment analysis, with particular attention paid to the veno-atrial connections, which can never be anatomically normal in hearts having isomeric appendages, although the patterns of venous return can be quasi-usual or quasimirror-imaged.

## 4 **What is the significance of ventricular looping?**

- As new material is added to the initial heart tube by ongoing migration to the arterial and venous poles from the heart-forming area, the ventricular component of the tube elongates and turns to the right, which represents ventricular looping.
- The next stage of ventricular development is 'ballooning' of the apical components of the right and left ventricles from the outlet and inlet components of the ventricular loop, respectively. With normal development, this places the right ventricle to the right of the developing left ventricle.
- Rightward expansion of the atrioventricular canal provides the inlet to the developing right ventricle.
- This means that, subsequent to the formation of the right ventricular inlet, it is the palmar surface of the right hand that can be placed on the developing septum, such that the fingers are in the outlet and the thumb is in the inlet component. This is called right-handed ventricular topology, and is the consequence of rightward ventricular looping
- Should the ventricular part of the developing heart tube loop to the left, then in association with leftward expansion of the atrioventricular canal, the situation is produced in which it is the developing left atrium that is placed into continuity with the developing right ventricle, and the right ventricle is then formed in leftward position relative to the left ventricle. In this situation, it is the palmar surface of the left hand, rather than the right, which is placed on the septal surface of the developing right ventricle with the thumb in the inlet and the fingers in the outlet. This produces left-handed ventricular topology (Figure 7).
- This means that, in almost all patients with usual atrial arrangement and concordant atrioventricular connections, the ventricular mass shows right-handed topology. In patients with concordant atrioventricular connections and mirror-imaged atrial arrangement, however, the ventricular mass shows left-handed topology.
- It then follows that, when the atrioventricular connections are discordant, there is left-handed topology in the setting of usual atrial arrangement, but right-handed topology with mirror-imaged atrial arrangement. These conventions are the basis for description of segmental anatomy in the approach to analysis promoted by Van Praagh and his colleagues, with the arrangements described as

- (S,L,\*) and (I,D,\*), the asterisk representing the topological arrangement of the arterial segment.
- For those using sequential segmental analysis, it can be presumed that the topological arrangement of the ventricular mass is in keeping with the atrioventricular connections.
- In the setting of isomerism of the atrial appendages, however, it is necessary always to describe the ventricular topology, since the atrioventricular connections themselves are always mixed when the atrial appendages are isomeric (Figure 8).

**10 Figure 8. Combinations of atrial arrangement and ventricular topology that produce the various biventricular atrioventricular connections. When the atrial appendages are isomeric, the atrioventricular connections are always mixed. In this setting, therefore, it is always necessary to specify topology so as to provide a complete description.**

## 5 **What is the origin of the pulmonary veins?**

- The atrial component of the developing heart tube is attached to the pharyngeal mesenchyme through the dorsal mesocardium (Figure 3). At this stage, neither the lungs nor any boundaries between the atrial component of the heart tube and the systemic venous tributaries have been formed.
- Once the venous valves have formed, it becomes possible to recognise the boundaries of the systemic venous sinus. Associated with this, a strand of tissue forms in the midline of the pharyngeal mesenchyme.
- Subsequent canalisation of this mid-pharyngeal strand provides a connection between the developing intraparenchymal pulmonary veins and the left atrium, with the newly formed channel opening into the left atrium between the folds showing the dorsal mesocardial connection.
- This newly formed pulmonary vein opens into the left atrium through a myocardial portal with atrial characteristics. The walls at the site of connection are different from the walls of the systemic venous tributaries.
- The initial opening of the pulmonary vein is adjacent to the left atrioventricular junction. Only at a much later stage does it become possible to recognise separate openings for the right and left pulmonary veins. Following formation of the separate pulmonary

- venous orifices, the superior interatrial fold develops, which provides the superior rim of the oval fossa.
- The walls of the pulmonary veins possess a myocardial phenotype and have never had any relationship with the walls of the systemic venous sinus (Figure 9).

Moorman and Dr. Aleksander Sizarov, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and are reproduced with their permission.*

## 6 **Describe the development of the atrial septum**

- The first signs of atrial septation is the formation of a ridge in the roof of the atrial component of the heart tube. As it grows towards the orifice of the atrioventricular canal, this first septum (septum primum) carries a cap of mesenchyme on its leading edge.
- The atrioventricular canal itself is divided into right and left parts by the fusion within its cavity of the superior and inferior atrioventricular cushions. As the primary atrial septum grows towards the cushions, the space between the mesenchymal cap on its leading edge and the cushions represents the primary atrial foramen (foramen primum).
- With ongoing growth of the primary septum and its mesenchymal cap towards the cushions, there is a concomitant decrease in the size of the primary foramen, which is eventually closed by fusion of the cap with the cushions.
- By the time the primary foramen has been obliterated, however, the upper edge of the primary septum has broken away from the atrial roof to form the secondary atrial foramen (foramen secundum, Figure 10).
- As the primary foramen closes, a new mesenchymal structure develops from the dorsal margin of the mesocardium, known as the vestibular spine.
- With ongoing development, the vestibular spine and the mesenchymal cap muscularise, forming the inferoanterior buttress of the oval fossa (fossa ovale).
- The primary septum itself then forms the floor of the newly formed oval fossa. Its superior rim is formed by an infolding of the atrial roof between the attachments of the pulmonary veins to the left atrium and the caval veins to the right atrium.
- The oval foramen (foramen ovale) is the space between the infolded superior interatrial fold and the cranial margin of the primary septum, with the primary septum itself forming a flap valve over the foramen (Figure 11).

#### 7 **What is the difference between an atrial septal defect and an interatrial communication?**

- The normal atrial septum has two components:
  - a) floor of the oval fossa, which is derived from the primary atrial septum;
  - b) anteroinferior buttress, which is formed by muscularisation of the mesenchymal cap carried on the primary septum and the vestibular spine.
- True atrial septal defects are produced either because of deficiencies or fenestrations of the floor of the oval fossa, or because of inappropriate formation of the anteroinferior buttress, including:
  - a) oval fossa (ostium secundum) defects which represent deficiencies or fenestrations of the floor of the fossa resulting from inappropriate formation of the primary atrial septum. They should be distinguished from persistent patency of the oval foramen (PFO), when the flap valve of the fossa overlaps but fails to fuse with the anterosuperior interatrial fold. Such persistent patency is found in around 25% of normal individuals;
  - b) vestibular defects which are much rarer and secondary to improper fusion of the muscularising components of the anteroinferior buttress of the oval fossa (Figure 12).
- Interatrial communications represent lesions outside the confines of the atrial septum, including:
  - a) sinus venosus defects which are the commonest of these extraseptal communications and are the consequence of an anomalous connection of one or more pulmonary veins to a caval vein, with the pulmonary veins retaining their left atrial connection. Sinus venosus defects can be found in the openings of either the superior or inferior caval veins. On occasion, they can be distant from the atrial orifice of the systemic venous channel (Figure 13);
  - b) coronary sinus defect which is the rarest interatrial communication outside the confines of the atrial septum. This lesion permits shunting across the right atrial orifice of the sinus because of fenestration, or absence, of the walls that usually interpose between the cavities of the coronary sinus, or a persistent left superior caval vein, and the left atrium;
  - c) ostium primum defect which is an atrioventricular rather than an atrial septal defect.

**Figure 12. Atrial septal defects: A) true defects within the oval fossa (yellow oval) and a vestibular defect within the anteroinferior buttress; B) persistent patency of the oval foramen, with the flap valve of sufficient size to cover the margins of the fossa (double-headed white arrow) but fails to fuse with the anterosuperior margin, leaving a potential interatrial communication (doubleheaded white arrow with red borders). Shunting across the communication is only possible when right atrial pressure exceeds that in the left atrium.**

#### 8 **What are the phenotypic features of an atrioventricular septal defect?**

- The commonality of the atrioventricular junction, along with the trifoliate configuration of the left atrioventricular valve are the fundamental phenotypic features of an atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), which is also known as an atrioventricular canal defect.
- During gestation, the bridging leaflets of the common atrioventricular valve, as typically seen in the atrioventricular septal defect, are derived from the superior and inferior atrioventricular cushions, which when fused separate the atrioventricular canal into the right and left atrioventricular orifices (Figure 14).
- In the past, the left component of the common atrioventricular valve or junction was usually described as a 'cleft mitral valve', which is incorrect. This is because the left half of the persisting common atrioventricular junction is guarded by a trifoliate valve (Figure 14B) rather than a bifoliate valve, even when the common atrioventricular junction itself is divided into separate valvar orifices for the right and left ventricles, as in the case of an AVSD without ventricular septal defect (Figure 15).
- The building blocks of the left half of the common atrioventricular valve are the same as those producing the aortic leaflet (or anterior leaflet) of the mitral valve in normal hearts.
- In AVSD, the commonality of the atrioventricular junction and the trifoliate configuration of the left atrioventricular valve are present irrespective of the level of shunting across the septal defect, hence above the valve plane, below the valve plane or both.
- Comparable arrangements are also found when there is a common valve guarding the common junction, or when the bridging leaflets are themselves fused to produce separate right and left valvar orifices for the right and left ventricles (Figure 16).
- In most cases, the bridging leaflets float more or less freely within the atrioventricular septal defect. This permits shunting at both atrial and ventricular levels.
- When the bridging leaflets are themselves fused to the crest of the muscular ventricular septum, the arrangement confines the potential for shunting across the atrioventricular septal defect at atrial level, producing a so-called 'ostium primum' defect.
- Less frequently, the bridging leaflets can be attached to the leading edge of the atrial septum, thus producing an atrioventricular septal defect with exclusively ventricular shunting. In this latter setting, the heart retains the common atrioventricular junction, along with the trifoliate configuration of the left atrioventricular valve.
- In rare circumstances, the atrioventricular septal defect can close spontaneously. This produces the arrangement of a heart with intact septal structures, but with a common atrioventricular junction and a trifoliate left atrioventricular valve.

**Figure 14. A) Atrioventricular cushions as seen in a developing mouse embryo sacrificed at embryonic day 12, just prior to fusion of the superior and inferior cushions that lie edge-to-edge within the atrioventricular canal. B) Atrioventricular septal defect with the common atrioventricular junction guarded by a common atrioventricular valve. There is an obvious similarity between the arrangements of the bridging leaflets and the superior and inferior atrioventricular (AV) cushions. The 'trifoliate' arrangement of apposition of the left ventricular cushions in the developing mouse heart (white dotted lines) parallels the configuration of the leaflets that guard the left half of the common atrioventricular junction in the specimen with deficient atrioventricular septation. In the developing mouse, however, the outflow tract remains undivided, whereas the subaortic root is committed to the left ventricle in the specimen with an atrioventricular septal defect. Both images are viewed from the ventricular apex looking towards the base of the ventricular mass.**

**Figure 15. A) Atrioventricular septal defect with separate valvar orifices for the left and right ventricles ('ostium primum defect'); and B) a normal heart in mouse embryos sacrificed at embryonic day 15.5. Both short-axis images are viewed from the ventricular apex looking towards the base. The mouse with the atrioventricular septal defect has maintained the trifoliate configuration of the left half of the common atrioventricular junction despite the commitment of the aortic root to the left ventricle, whereas the normal mouse, subsequent to closure of the embryonic interventricular communication, has formed a bifoliate left valve. The black dotted line shows the line of fusion between the superior and inferior atrioventricular cushions in the normal mouse, whereas the left ventricular components of the cushions have remained unfused in the mouse with the atrioventricular septal defect.**

**Figure 16. The images show the commonality of the atrioventricular junction in hearts with an atrioventricular septal defect, when the junction is guarded by: A) a common valve; or B) when the bridging leaflets have themselves fused to produce separate valvar orifices for the right and left ventricles (star), and are additionally fused to the crest of the muscular ventricular septum. The area previously considered to represent a 'cleft' in the mitral valve (double-headed arrow in B) can be seen to be the zone of apposition between the left ventricular components of the bridging leaflets (compare with double-headed arrow in A). The dotted white lines shown the location of the crest of the muscular ventricular septum.**

## 9 **What is the origin of the membranous septum?**

- The normal ventricular septum is almost exclusively a muscular entity, with a small part within the left ventricular outflow tract that is fibrous (known as the membranous septum).
- Most often, it is crossed on its right ventricular aspect by the hinge of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve, which divides it into atrioventricular and interventricular components (Figure 17).

![](_page_21_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Figure 17. 'Four-chamber' section through the aortic root, with the non-coronary sinus and its leaflet removed. The hinge of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve (TV) crosses the membranous septum, dividing it into its atrioventricular and interventricular components.**

- During normal development, the expansion of the atrioventricular canal allows the connection of the developing right atrium with the right ventricle.
- During this process, the ventricular outflow tract, which is separating to form the aortic and pulmonary roots, remains supported above the cavity of the right ventricle.
- In order to close the ventricular septum, the developing aortic root, still supported above the cavity of the right ventricle, needs to come into continuity with the cavity of the left ventricle.
- This is achieved by creating a shelf within the cavity of the right ventricle by fusion of the proximal parts of the cushions dividing the

outflow tract into the aortic and pulmonary components. At the same time, this process begins to transfer the larger part of the persisting interventricular communication into the outflow tract for the left ventricle (Figure 18).

![](_page_22_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Figure 18. Process of transfer of the aortic root to the left ventricle in the developing mouse heart: A) embryonic day 13.5, where the greater part of the embryonic interventricular communication is remodelling so as to connect the aortic root with the left ventricle. This can be considered to represent the secondary interventricular communication. A persisting third component of the communication is then seen between the rightward part of the aortic root and the right ventricle; B) embryonic day 14.5, where this communication is closed by fusion of so-called tubercles derived from the superior and inferior atrioventricular (AV) cushions. This produces the membranous part of the ventricular septum and commits the secondary interventricular communication to the outflow tract for the left ventricle.**

- This part of the embryonic interventricular communication can be considered as a secondary channel, since part of the initial, or primary, interventricular communication has already been remodelled to form the inlet of the right ventricle.
- Subsequent to the remodelling of the secondary embryonic interventricular communication to become the subaortic outflow tract, a persisting third part of the communication remains as a channel between the cavities of the right and left ventricles.
- It is this channel that is then closed by growth of so-called tubercles from the atrioventricular cushions to produce the membranous part of the ventricular septum.
- When initially closed, the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve has yet to delaminate from the surface of the ventricular septum. It is only subsequent to the delamination of this leaflet that it becomes possible to recognise the atrioventricular and interventricular components of the membranous septum.

# 10 **Is there a muscular outlet septum in the normal heart?**

- There is no muscular septal component interposed between the ventricular outflow tracts in the normal heart.
- Moreover, by virtue of the wedging of the aortic root between the mitral valve and the ventricular septum, the inlet of the right ventricle is separated from the outlet, rather than the inlet, of the left ventricle.
- This is despite the fact that the proximal parts of the outflow cushions fuse to produce a shelf in the roof of the right ventricle. This process provides a channel between the developing aortic root and the cavity of the left ventricle (Figure 19).
- As part of this process, the shell of these proximal cushions achieves a myocardial phenotype. At the same time, however, the core of the cushions attenuates. The disappearance of the core of the cushions then produces an extracavitary area that interposes between the muscularising shell and the developing sinuses of the aortic root.
- The muscularising shell of the proximal cushions, therefore, becomes the freestanding infundibular sleeve. This lifts the pulmonary root away from the base of the ventricular mass.
- The formation of the freestanding infundibular sleeve makes it possible to remove the entirety of the pulmonary root and use it as an autograft in the Ross procedure. This would not be possible in the normal heart had there been formation of a muscular outlet septum.

This process builds a shelf in the roof of the right ventricle, committing the aortic root to the left ventricle through the secondary interventricular communication; B) oblique subcostal equivalent section at embryonic day 14.5, at the stage of closure of the tertiary interventricular communication. The shell of the muscularising proximal cushion mass is transforming into the subpulmonary infundibulum (black dashed line). The core of the cushion mass (white star with red borders) is attenuating to produce an extracavitary area between the developing infundibular sleeve and the forming sinuses of the aortic root.

#### 11 **Is <sup>a</sup> ventricular septal defect (VSD) the same as an interventricular communication?**

- During the development of the heart, there is extensive remoulding of the initial embryonic interventricular communication.
- The first, or primary, interventricular communication is the portal for passage of all the blood entering the developing left ventricle ultimately to reach the undivided outflow tract.
- The defects originating from a primary interventricular communication include:
  - a) defects in the setting of double-inlet left ventricle with doubleoutlet from the right ventricle;
  - b) defects seen with straddling and overriding of the tricuspid valve.
- The secondary interventricular communication is the embryonic interventricular channel underneath both outflow tracts where, during the normal expansion of the atrioventricular canal and formation of the right ventricular inlet, they remain supported above the cavity of the developing right ventricle. Defects originating from the secondary interventricular communication are found between the ventricles in the setting of double-outlet right ventricle.
- The tertiary interventricular communication is the route by which the rightward margin of the developing aortic root remains in communication with the cavity of the right ventricle, during the process of connection of the aortic root with the left ventricular cavity, with the secondary interventricular communication remoulded to become the left ventricular outflow tract.
- The tertiary interventricular communication is eventually closed during normal development by formation of the membranous part of the septum from the so-called tubercles of the atrioventricular cushions. Failure to close the tertiary communication results in production of a perimembranous ventricular septal defect.
- It follows that the channels found in the setting of double-outlet right ventricle, double-inlet left ventricle with DORV and perimembranous VSD represent the different stages of the remoulding of the embryonic interventricular communication and therefore cannot be considered all the same ventricular septal defects.

#### 12 **Describe the defects that open into the inlet of the right ventricle**

- There are four phenotypically different defects that open to the inlet of the right ventricle.
- The location of the atrioventricular conduction axis differs markedly in all of them.

- It is now well established that the 'septum of the atrioventricular canal' is the muscularising vestibular spine.
- The formation of this structure during normal development, along with its fusion with the atrioventricular cushions, divides the initial atrioventricular canal into the orifices of the tricuspid and mitral valves.
- One type of inlet defect results from a process of malalignment of the muscular component of the interventricular septum, by virtue of incomplete expansion of the atrioventricular canal, relative to the atrial septum.
- This defect is also perimembranous, since it is characterised by fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the mitral and tricuspid valves. It is found in the setting of straddling and overriding of the tricuspid valve. Because of the septal malalignment, the atrioventricular conduction axis arises from an anomalous posteroinferior atrioventricular node (Figure 20).

**Figure 20. Right ventricular inlet defect found in the setting of straddling and overriding of the tricuspid valve. It is a perimembranous defect with malalignment between the atrial septum and the muscular ventricular septum. The atrioventricular conduction axis (red dashed line) no longer originates from the regular atrioventricular node (red star with white borders). Instead, it takes origin from an anomalous inferior node (white star with red borders).**

The perimembranous defect shown in B) differs from the one shown in Figure 20 because of the presence of alignment between the atrial septum and the inferior part of the muscular ventricular septum.**

- A second type of inlet defect is where the opening into the inlet of the right ventricle exclusively has muscular margins. In these instances, the conduction axis courses in cranial fashion relative to the defect.
- A third type is the one represented by perimembranous defects extending to open to the inlet of the right ventricle. They are characterised by a fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the mitral and tricuspid valves forming their posterior margin but with alignment between the atrial and muscular ventricular septal structure.
- In this defect, the conduction axis is deviated inferiorly but it continues to arise from a regular atrioventricular node at the apex of the triangle of Koch. The triangle is itself deviated inferiorly due to the hypoplasia of the inferior component of the muscular ventricular septum (Figure 21).
- The fourth type is an atrioventricular septal defect opening directly to the inlet of the right ventricle with the potential only for ventricular shunting. This occurs when the bridging leaflets of the common atrioventricular valve abut against the leading edge of the atrial septum during ventricular systole. In this instance, the atrioventricular conduction axis will arise from an inferiorly deviated atrioventricular node.

#### 13 **What is the phenotypic feature of a supracristal ventricular septal defect?**

- For some time, ventricular septal defects were categorised on the basis of being supracristal or infracristal.
- Examination of the defects distinguished in this fashion shows a lack of logic, since rather than the defects opening in different fashion to the right ventricle, it is the structure nominated as the 'crista' that varies.
- The majority of supracristal defects open into the right ventricle between the limbs of the septomarginal trabeculation (SMT), also known as the septal band (Figure 22A).
- In this setting, the feature nominated as the 'crista' is the myocardial structure produced by fusion of the caudal limb of the septal trabeculation with the ventriculo-infundibular fold, the latter structure being derived from the inner heart curvature.
- The feature nominated as the 'crista' in an infracristal defect is the supraventricular crest. This is formed by the freestanding subpulmonary muscular infundibulum, along with the right ventricular margin of the inner heart curvature, which is known as the ventriculoinfundibular fold (Figure 22B).
- The differences between the appearance of the two defects is now well explained on the basis of the development of the normal right ventricular outflow tract.
- The normal supraventricular crest is formed in its larger part by muscularisation of the proximal outflow cushions, which subsequently become the freestanding subpulmonary infundibulum (Figure 23A).

![](_page_29_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 22. Ventricular septal defects defined by the 'crista', rather than location: A) in the so-called 'supracristal defect', the myocardial structure identified as the 'crista' is produced by fusion of the ventriculo-infundibular fold with the caudal limb of the septomarginal trabeculation (white star with red borders). The phenotypic feature of this defect is the fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the aortic and pulmonary valves in the roof of the defect; B) in the so-called 'infracristal defect', the structure identified as the 'crista' is the supraventricular crest.**

![](_page_30_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 23. A) The defect described by some as being 'infracristal' lies inferior to the structure derived by muscularisation of the proximal outflow cushions. B) In the defect described by some as being 'supracristal', the proximal outflow cushions have failed to muscularise. The difference between the two defects, therefore, reflects the varying maturation of the proximal outflow cushions, rather than the way the defects open relative to the ventricular septum.**

• This explains the phenotypic feature of the supracristal defect, which is better described as being doubly committed and juxta-arterial. The distinguishing feature is the fibrous continuity between the leaflets of the aortic and pulmonary valves.

# 14 **What are the phenotypic features of tetralogy of Fallot?**

- Tetralogy of Fallot is a combination of four morphological features, namely an interventricular communication, biventricular connection of the aortic root, subpulmonary stenosis and right ventricular hypertrophy.
- There is a wide range of combinations of these morphological features, resulting in no two cases being morphologically identical.
- For some time, it was thought that anterocephalad malalignment of the muscular outlet septum or its fibrous remnant, was the unifying feature of the tetralogy spectrum.
- Such a feature, however, is to be found not only in the setting of tetralogy of Fallot but also in an Eisenmenger ventricular septal defect, which is a perimembranous outlet defect associated with overriding of the pulmonary trunk.
- The additional finding required to produce the phenotypical feature of tetralogy is the anomalous formation of the septoparietal trabeculations. In the tetralogy spectrum, the trabeculations are usually hypertrophied.
- It is the combination of these two features that produces the characteristic narrowing at the mouth of the subpulmonary infundibulum (Figure 24).
- Hearts with this phenotypical feature can show morphological variability in terms of the:
  - a) type of interventricular communication which can:
    - i) be perimembranous;
    - ii) have a muscular posteroinferior rim;
    - iii) be doubly committed and juxta-arterial;
  - b) extent of override of the aortic root;
  - c) degree of obstruction of the subpulmonary outflow tract;
  - d) right ventricular hypertrophy which is recognised to be a haemodynamic consequence of the subpulmonary narrowing.

![](_page_32_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 24. Images demonstrating malalignment of the muscular outlet septum, which in isolation, does not produce the phenotypical feature of tetralogy of Fallot: A) Eisenmenger defect where the subpulmonary outflow tract is unobstructed despite the presence of malalignment of the outlet septum, along with well-formed septoparietal trabeculations; B) tetralogy of Fallot, characterised by the phenotypical narrowing between the malaligned muscular outlet septum and the septoparietal trabeculations.**

#### 15 **What are the phenotypical characteristics of defects associated with systemic-to-pulmonary collateral arteries?**

- In the setting of pulmonary atresia, the pulmonary arterial supply is derived most frequently either through a persistently patent arterial duct or via systemic-to-pulmonary collateral arteries (Figure 25).
- Systemic-to-pulmonary is a better descriptor of the collateral arteries than major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs), since the collateral arteries can arise not only from the aorta but also from the coronary or brachiocephalic arteries.
- These two sources hardly ever supply the same lung. Indeed, it is a good working rule that, if systemic-to-pulmonary collateral arteries are found supplying one or both lungs, the arterial duct will be absent, unless it provides the sole supply to one lung through a discontinuous intrapericardial pulmonary artery.
- The pulmonary arterial supply via the persistently patent arterial duct is almost without exception found in pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum.
- Pulmonary supply via an arterial duct can also be found in cases of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect, as in the context of:
  - a) transposition of the great arteries;
  - b) congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries;
  - c) isomerism with a VSD.
- Instead, the supply of blood to the lungs through systemic-topulmonary arteries is found with frequency only with pulmonary atresia in the context of tetralogy of Fallot. It is a subset of the hearts that collectively can be described as pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect.
- The pulmonary arterial supply in tetralogy with pulmonary atresia can also be through a persistently patent arterial duct. If via a duct, however, there will be a unifocal supply to all the bronchopulmonary segments.
- Pulmonary arterial supply through systemic-to-pulmonary collateral arteries is multifocal, since hardly ever does a solitary collateral artery supply all the bronchopulmonary segments. Instead, the supply is either direct, or else through anastomoses with intrapericardial pulmonary arteries.
- In rare circumstances, the pulmonary arterial supply in tetralogy with pulmonary atresia can be through an aortopulmonary window, or via coronary arterial fistulous communications. Discontinuous pulmonary arteries can be fed through bilateral arterial ducts, or through a duct

![](_page_34_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 25. Images demonstrating systemic-to-pulmonary collateral arteries in the setting of pulmonary atresia, with a supply through: A) a persistently patent arterial duct to confluent intrapericardial pulmonary arteries (where the intrapericardial pulmonary arteries supply all of the bronchopulmonary segments in a unifocal fashion); and B) systemic-topulmonary collateral arteries arising from the descending intrathoracic aorta, with coexisting confluent intrapericardial pulmonary arteries, which anastomose with the collateral arteries. In these instances, the intrapericardial arteries have a limited multifocal supply to some, but not all, of the bronchopulmonary segments.**

in one lung and systemic-to-pulmonary collateral arteries in the other lung. In the past, arterial ducts with an unusual origin were described as 'arteries of the 5th pharyngeal arch'. It is now known that the socalled '5th arch' does not exist.

- It remains to be proven as to whether the systemic-to-pulmonary arteries are hypertrophied bronchial arteries.
- It is a mistake to seek to distinguish the intrapericardial pulmonary arteries as being 'native', as the systemic-to-pulmonary collateral arteries are equally 'native'.

## 16 **What is double-outlet right ventricle?**

- Double-outlet right ventricle (DORV) is the situation in which the larger part of both arterial roots are supported by the morphologically right ventricle.
- The definition of the arrangement existing when both arterial trunks arise from the morphological right ventricle has long been contentious.
- The resolution of these discussions has been provided by the concept of the 'morphological method', which stated that one variable feature in the heart should not be defined on the basis of another feature that is itself variable.
- As a result, only the proportion of the overriding arterial trunk supported by the right, as opposed to the left ventricle, is the determinant of the precise ventriculo-arterial connection, and DORV is no more than one of the possible ventriculo-arterial connections in the setting of overriding of either the aortic or the pulmonary root, or in some instances both arterial roots.
- In this setting, the channel overridden by the arterial root will have right and left ventricular borders. Whether the root is supported predominantly by the right ventricle, and hence in the setting of double outlet, can be determined by whether the surgeon considers that they are able to close the right ventricular border.
- If this is the case, the ventriculo-arterial connections will have been either concordant or discordant and the surgeon will have closed the 'ventricular septal defect'.
- If the surgeon considers that they have had to tunnel the right ventricular border of the overriding root to the crest of the muscular ventricular septum, then the ventriculo-arterial connection will initially have been that of double-outlet right ventricle. The leftward border of the defect will then have been an interventricular communication, rather than a 'ventricular septal defect' (Figure 26).

![](_page_36_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 26. Relative position of the plane of an interventricular communication (red dotted line) and the patch (in yellow) used to close it, where: A) the aorta is committed to the left ventricle in a simple ventricular septal defect and the patch coincides with the plane of the interventricular communication; B) there is 50% aortic override in tetralogy of Fallot and the plane of the interventricular communication is to the left of the plane of the patch. The patch includes a small portion or the right ventricular cavity to redirect the flow from the left ventricle to the aorta; and C) the aorta is committed to the right ventricle and the plane of the interventricular communication and that of the patch are on the opposite sides of the aortic root, as in double-outlet right ventricle. A large portion of the right ventricular cavity is required to redirect the flow from the left ventricle to the aorta.**

## 17 **What is <sup>a</sup> functionally univentricular heart?**

- A functionally univentricular heart is characterised by an incomplete ventricle, which is of insufficient size to support independently either the pulmonary or the systemic circulation, such as with a:
  - a) dominant left ventricle and an incomplete right ventricle;
  - b) dominant right ventricle and an incomplete left ventricle.
- Very few congenitally malformed hearts are found with a solitary chamber within the ventricular mass. If found, such solitary ventricles are of indeterminate ventricular morphology, although occasionally

hearts can be found with a dominant right ventricle when the accompanying left ventricle is so small as to escape clinical detection.

- The majority of hearts that, in the past, were described as 'single ventricles' have a dominant left ventricle, with incomplete formation of the right ventricle due to absence of its inlet component. This is found either when both atrioventricular junctions are connected to the dominant left ventricle (double-inlet left ventricle, [DILV]), or when there is an absence of either the right-sided or the left-sided atrioventricular connection. The latter arrangement is seen most frequently in the setting of tricuspid atresia.
- These hearts with a double-inlet ventricle, or with absence of either the right-sided or the left-sided atrioventricular connections, together make up the group of hearts with univentricular atrioventricular connections.
- Hearts with biventricular atrioventricular connections can also produce a functionally univentricular arrangement. This occurs when either the morphological right or the morphological left ventricle, although normally constituted, is too small as to support the systemic or the pulmonary circulation, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA-IVS) and hypoplastic right ventricle, or severely unbalanced AVSD.
- Other hearts with complex circulatory patterns may be deemed to be functionally univentricular and hence better suited for surgical repair by means of construction of the Fontan circulation.

## 18 **What is the phenotypic feature of tricuspid atresia?**

- Atresia, when defined literally, is either the absence or abnormal closure of a bodily communication.
- Both of these phenotypes are to be found in the setting of tricuspid atresia, since the lesion can be produced either by an imperforate tricuspid valve or by the absence of the right atrioventricular connection in the setting of a usual atrial arrangement with the left atrium connected to a dominant left ventricle (Figure 27).
- The arrangement with the absence of the right atrioventricular connection is by far the commonest variant found in patients with tricuspid atresia. By virtue of the absence of the right atrioventricular connection, the right ventricle in this setting is incomplete, since it lacks its inlet component.
- The arrangement as seen in postnatal life reflects the situation as seen during the initial stages of normal development, when the atrioventricular canal is supported exclusively by the developing

![](_page_38_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 27. Macroscopic images demonstrating the difference between tricuspid atresia produced by: A) an imperforate valve; and B) absence of the right atrioventricular (AV) connection.**

**Figure 28.

The developing right ventricle at this early stage receives its blood through the embryonic interventricular communication (IVC), although it already possesses its apical component.**

- morphological left ventricle, and the developing right ventricle gives rise to the entirety of the developing outflow tract (Figure 28).
- The differences in morphology between the two phenotypic variants of tricuspid atresia serve to illustrate the differences between the hypoplastic right ventricle found in the setting of the imperforate valve, and the incomplete ventricle found in the absence of the right atrioventricular connection. Both variants, however, produce functionally univentricular hearts.

#### 19 **What is the developmental background of common arterial trunk?**

- The phenotypic feature of common arterial trunk is the commonality of the ventriculo-arterial junction, rather than the presence of a common intrapericardial arterial component or 'truncus'.
- The essential feature of common arterial trunk, therefore, is persistence of the undivided embryonic 'conus', specifically the intermediate and proximal components of the outflow tract, rather than lack of division of its distal component (Figure 29).
- When the term 'persistent truncus arteriosus' was first introduced, it was used to describe the distal part of the developing outflow tract, which is separated by the development of a protrusion from the dorsal wall of the aortic sac to produce the intrapericardial arterial trunks.
- It is the manner of separation of the distal part of the outflow tract that, traditionally, has been used to subcategorise the examples of common arterial trunk.
- In the initial approach, four types were described by Collett and Edwards according to the origin of the pulmonary arteries. Type IV was subsequently recognised to be a solitary arterial trunk, rather than a common trunk, since it was defined on the basis of absence of the intrapericardial pulmonary arteries.
- In the revised version proposed by Van Praagh and Van Praagh, Types I and II of the Collett and Edwards classification were unified as Types 1 and 2. The Van Praaghs then introduced new Types 3 and 4, to account for variants with discontinuous pulmonary arteries and hypoplasia of the aortic component of the trunk, respectively.
- At the same time, the Van Praaghs pointed out that a simpler approach was to separate the variants according to the dominance of the aortic as opposed to the pulmonary component of the common arterial trunk.
- The concept of aortic as opposed to pulmonary dominance provides a much simpler categorisation. It is pulmonary dominance that is

![](_page_41_Picture_2.jpeg)

Figure 29. Embryological images demonstrating two embryonic mice genetically modified so as to produce common arterial trunk, defined on the basis of a trunk that gives rise directly to the systemic, pulmonary and coronary arteries: A) following knock-out of the Tbx1 gene, there has been no separation of the distal outflow tract, so that the trunk has an aortic dominance; B) following disruption of the Furin enzyme, the aortopulmonary septum (white arrow) has grown so as to divide the distal outflow tract disproportionately in favour of the pulmonary component of the trunk. The aortic arch is interrupted (white star with red borders), with the descending aorta fed through the persistently patent arterial duct. The left subclavian artery (LSCA) arises from the descending aorta. AV = atrioventricular; VA = ventriculo-arterial.

- accompanied by interruption of the aortic arch or severe coarctation. When there is aortic dominance, it then becomes necessary to describe with precision the origin of the pulmonary arteries.
- In the majority of cases, the pulmonary arteries arise in close proximity to each other from the posterior or leftward component of the aortic dominant trunk, meaning that frequently they are described as 'Type 1½' using traditional classifications.
- The origin of the pulmonary arteries, however, can involve one of the sinuses of the truncal root, whilst the right and left pulmonary arteries can cross as they extend towards the mediastinum.

## 20 **What is transposition?**

- Transposition literally means 'placed across' and it refers to the placement of the arterial roots across the ventricular septum, such that they arise from morphologically inappropriate ventricles.
- Irrespective of the atrioventricular connections, which can be concordant, discordant, mixed in the setting of isomeric atrial appendages, or univentricular, the transposition is always 'complete' in the sense that each of the arterial trunks is completely placed across the septum.
- The commonest variant is now simply described as 'transposition'. In most instances, it is usually qualified to include 'of the great arteries'. The latter part, however, is redundant.
- The discordant ventriculo-arterial connections can be found with various relationships of the arterial trunks and with varied infundibular morphology. The combination of discordant ventriculo-arterial connections with concordant atrioventricular connections can itself be found in usual or mirror-imaged variants.
- Most usually, the aortic root is found anteriorly and to the right. It can, nonetheless, be found in a leftward location. The latter relationship is the rule when transposition is found in its mirror-imaged variant. It is inappropriate, therefore, to use 'd-transposition' as being the default option for transposition.
- The presence of a ventricular septal defect, or obstruction of the ventricular outflow tracts, are the associated malformations of greatest clinical significance.
- The developmental defect underscoring the production of the discordant ventriculo-arterial connections is the fusion of the major outflow cushions in the outflow tract in a straight as opposed to their normal spiralling fashion (Figure 30).
- The fusion of the outflow cushions in a straight as opposed to spiralling fashion serves to join the rightward component of the

![](_page_43_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 30. Embryological images demonstrating the arrangement of the outflow cushions in a: A) control mouse; and B) mouse with knock-out of the Ptx1 gene. Ongoing development in the mice with the knock-out gene produces either transposition or double-outlet right ventricle with subpulmonary interventricular communication. It is the fusion of the outflow cushions in a straight as opposed to spiralling fashion that underscores these changes.**

proximal outflow tract to the aortic component of the aortic sac, and the leftward component to the pulmonary component. It is then the leftward component of the outflow tract, which is closest to the embryonic interventricular communication that is transferred to the developing left ventricle, thus producing the discordant ventriculoarterial connections.

## 21 **How can transposition be congenitally corrected?**

- When discordant ventriculo-arterial connections (transposition) are associated with concordant atrioventricular connections, the systemic and pulmonary circulations are arranged in parallel, rather than in series.
- Connections across the atrioventricular junctions, in a discordant fashion as opposed to concordant, serve to 'correct' the discordant ventriculo-arterial connections. By virtue of the double discordance, the circulations are then again in series, even though the arterial trunks are supported by morphologically inappropriate ventricles.
- This occurs as a consequence of looping of the ventricular component of the heart tube in a mirror-imaged fashion compared to normal.
- In the usual situation, the ventricular component of the heart tube loops to the right. Expansion of the atrioventricular canal then places the developing right atrium in communication with the developing right ventricle, hence ensuring the formation of concordant atrioventricular connections.
- If the ventricular component of the heart tube should loop to the left, in contrast, expansion of the atrioventricular canal will similarly take place in a leftward direction. This will serve to connect the developing left atrium to the right ventricle, which is derived from the outlet component of the heart tube. It will be positioned in a left-sided position subsequent to leftward ventricular looping.
- In the setting of a mirror-imaged atrial arrangement, it will be rightward looping of the ventricular component of the heart tube that will produce discordant, rather than concordant, atrioventricular connections.
- Almost always, the formation of discordant atrioventricular connections sets the scene for associated formation of discordant ventriculo-arterial connections. On occasion, nonetheless, the ventriculo-arterial connection can be that of a double-outlet right ventricle. On rare occasions, furthermore, the ventriculo-arterial connections can be concordant. The latter combination will produce the haemodynamic picture of regular transposition.

#### 22 **What is the classification system used to describe the origin of the coronary arteries?**

- Almost always, the major coronary arteries arise from one or other, but usually both, of the sinuses of the aortic root that are adjacent to the pulmonary root.
- Endothelial stems grow out from the developing aortic root, which occurs during the separation of the intermediate part of the outflow tract into its aortic and pulmonary components. The stems initially develop distal to the myocardial turret that surrounds the intermediate part of the outflow tract. They are incorporated into the sinuses, as the sinuses themselves expand proximally relative to the myocardial boundary of the developing outflow tract.
- The major coronary arteries themselves are formed within the atrioventricular and interventricular grooves, producing in this way the right, anterior interventricular and circumflex arteries.
- With normal development, the endothelial stem growing from the leftward of the two aortic valvar sinuses formed adjacent to the pulmonary root joins with the anterior interventricular and circumflex arteries. The stem from the rightward adjacent sinus joins with the right coronary artery.
- According to the Leiden classification, as viewed by an observer standing upright (figuratively speaking) in the sinus that is not adjacent to the pulmonary trunk, one of the sinuses will be to their right hand. This sinus is conventionally nominated as #1. The other sinus will be to the left hand of the observer and it is nominated as #2 (Figure 31).
- This arrangement of the aortic valvar sinuses, as seen by the observer standing in the non-adjacent sinus, will remain constant irrespective of the relationship of the arterial roots to each other. On this basis, the arrangement of the right, circumflex and anterior interventricular arteries can be described in constant fashion in terms of their origin from either the right-handed (#1) or left-handed (#2) aortic sinuses. According to their relationship to the arterial pedicles, each of the arteries can arise from either of the adjacent valvar sinuses.
- In the setting of transposition, the commonest pattern is for the main stem of the left coronary artery to arise from sinus #1, and to divide into the anterior interventricular and circumflex arteries. The right coronary artery then takes its origin from sinus #2.
- Any arrangement is possible, including the crossing of coronary arteries so as to arise from seemingly inappropriate sinuses. The arteries can also cross between the arterial roots with an interarterial course, usually with an intramural location within the wall of the aortic

![](_page_46_Figure_2.jpeg)

Figure 31. Classification of the origin of the coronary arteries. The images show how the origin of the coronary arteries can be described in terms of the view obtained by the surgeon 'standing upright' in the non-adjacent sinus and looking towards the adjacent aortic valvar sinuses. Irrespective of the relationship of the arterial trunks, one sinus will always be to the right hand of the surgeon, which is then nominated as #1. The other sinus will be to the left hand, and it is nominated as #2. The arrangements shown are as seen in the: A) normal heart (1R,2LCx); and B) commonest variant of transposition (1LCx,2R).

root. In most instances, nonetheless, the coronary arteries will arise from their closest sinus according to the relationship of the arterial roots.

## 23 **What is the aortopulmonary septum?**

- In the postnatal heart, each of the aortic and pulmonary pathways can be considered as possessing a ventricular outflow tract, an arterial root, and then intrapericardial and extrapericardial arterial components.
- At present, it is usual to assess the developing outflow tract in terms of its components labelled as the 'truncus' and 'conus', along with an extrapericardial aortic sac. If we presume that the 'conus' gives rise to the ventricular outflow tracts and the 'truncus' to the intrapericardial arterial trunks, with the extrapericardial arterial pathways derived from the aortic sac, however, the current categorisation makes no provision for the arterial roots.
- A better approach considers the outflow tract as possessing proximal, intermediate and distal components, with the cavity of the distal component becoming continuous with the cavity of the aortic sac at the margins of the pericardial cavity.
- The intermediate component can be recognised in anatomic terms by the appearance within its lumen of the intercalated swellings. The distal ends of these swellings, along with the major outflow cushions, will cavitate to produce the leaflets of the arterial valves, with the arterial roots forming within the intermediate component of the outflow tract (Figure 32).
- Earlier in development, the aortic sac is the manifold that gives rise to the arteries of the pharyngeal arches, which will themselves transform into the extrapericardial components of the aortic and pulmonary pathways. The arteries of the 3rd and 4th arches will form the systemic pathways, while the arteries of the pulmonary arches will give rise to the right and left pulmonary arteries, which develop within the pharyngeal mesenchyme. At this stage, it is the dorsal wall of the aortic sac that represents the aortopulmonary septum (Figure 33).
- With ongoing development, the dorsal wall of the aortic sac grows and protrudes into the cavity of the distal outflow tract, separating it into the intrapericardial components of the aorta and the pulmonary trunk. The protrusion is the aortopulmonary septum.

![](_page_48_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 32. Long axis of the developing outflow tract of the mouse heart, subsequent to the formation of the socalled intercalated swellings (white stars with red borders). The proximal part will become separated into the ventricular outflow tracts, with the intermediate part being transformed into the arterial roots, and the distal part forming the intrapericardial arterial trunks. The dotted white line shows the site of fusion between the aortopulmonary septum and the major cushions within the outflow tract. This obliterates the embryonic aortopulmonary foramen.**

- The protrusion eventually fuses with the distal ends of the major outflow cushions to obliterate the embryonic aortopulmonary foramen. The major cushions themselves fuse with each other so as to separate, the arterial roots distally, and the right and left ventricular outflow tracts proximally.
- Failure of fusion of the protrusion with the ends of the major outflow cushions results in persistence of an aortopulmonary window.
- Failure of fusion of the major outflow cushions themselves produces a common arterial trunk.

**Figure 33. Stages of formation of the aortopulmonary septum in the developing mouse: A) early stage, in which the arteries of the 3rd and 4th pharyngeal arches are bilaterally symmetrical, and separated from the arteries of the pulmonary arches by the dorsal wall of the aortic sac (white star with red borders). The white arrows with red borders show the junction between the distal outflow tract and the aortic sac at the margins of the pericardial cavity; B) the dorsal wall of the aortic sac has protruded into the cavity of the distal outflow tract, separating the intrapericardial components of the developing aorta and pulmonary trunk. The white arrows with red borders continue to show the margins of the pericardial cavity. The protrusion has become the aortopulmonary septum. At this stage, the space between the protrusion and the edges of the major outflow cushions**

(double-headed white arrow) is an aortopulmonary foramen. It is closed at the later stage to separate the intrapericardial pulmonary arteries. The major cushions fuse to separate the intermediate and proximal parts of the outflow tract.

#### 24 Describe the embryological origin of vascular rings

- Multiple arrangements of the extrapericardial branches of the aorta are known to encircle the trachea-oesophageal pedicle and produce 'dysphagia lusorum'.
- All of these patterns are well explained on the basis of the hypothetical double arch as proposed by Edwards (Figure 34).

![](_page_50_Picture_6.jpeg)

Figure 34. Hypothetical double aortic arch (as hypothesised by Edwards), which encircles the tracheo-oesophageal pedicle and unites posteriorly to form a neutral descending aorta. Each arch gives rise to a common carotid artery and a subclavian artery from its cranial surface, and an arterial duct from its dorsal surface. The various vascular rings, along with isolation of the brachiocephalic arteries, are all explained on the basis of attenuation and disappearance of the different components of the double arch, including the arterial ducts.

- Examination of the evolution of the arteries extending through the pharyngeal arches of the developing embryo provides validation for the correctness of the hypothesis as put forward by Edwards.
- Although six sets of pharyngeal arch arteries tend to be shown in the classical diagram based on the investigation of Rathke, carried out in the 19th century, in fact it is only the arteries of the 3rd, 4th and pulmonary arches that provide the vessels as shown by Edwards in the hypothetical model (Figure 34).
- During early development, these arteries are bilaterally symmetrical and encircle the developing tracheo-oesophageal pedicle.
- With ongoing normal development, the right-sided components of these bilateral symmetrical primordiums undergo attenuation and the components encircling the pedicle to join the descending aorta disappear.
- During the stages of attenuation, nonetheless, a pattern can be visualised that provides the validation of the concept advanced by Edwards (Figure 35).

![](_page_51_Figure_7.jpeg)

**Figure 35. Reconstruction of the developing arteries of the pharyngeal arches in the mouse at embryonic day 12.5. There is clear bilateral symmetry of the arteries of the 3rd and 4th arches, which both join the right- and left-sided descending aortas. The arteries of the pulmonary arch are also bilateral at this stage, although the right-sided artery is beginning to regress. The pattern is remarkably similar to the hypothetical double arch as proposed by Edwards.** *Image created and reproduced with permission by Dr. Simon Bamforth, Newcastle University, UK.*

## 25 **What is the origin of the arterial duct?**

- The arterial duct (also known as the 'ductus arteriosus') is an integral part of the foetal circulation. Its presence ensures that the deoxygenated systemic venous return of the foetus, having passed through the right ventricle, is returned to the placenta, thus bypassing the lungs during foetal life.
- From a developmental standpoint, the arterial duct is derived from the artery of the pharyngeal arch previously described as being '6th'. We now know that there is never a 5th arch. The so-called '6th arch', therefore, is better described as being the pulmonary arch.
- During early development, the arteries of the pharyngeal arches are bilaterally symmetrical.
- By the time that the arteries of the pulmonary arches are recognisable, however, the arteries of the 1st and 2nd arches have effectively disappeared, becoming incorporated into the arteries supplying the head and face. It is possible, nonetheless, to recognise symmetrical arteries extending through the 3rd, 4th and pulmonary arches (Figure 36).
- With ongoing development, the right-sided components of the bilateral symmetrical arrangement largely disappear. This leaves the left pulmonary arch artery as the arterial duct, with the left 4th arch artery forming the transverse component of the aortic arch (Figure 37).
- When first formed, the subclavian arteries, derived from the 7th cervical intersegmental arteries, take their origin from the descending aorta. It is only later in development that these arteries migrate cranially so as to arise from the transverse aortic arch. They cross the insertion of the duct to the descending aorta during this process. The isthmus of the aortic arch is the component between the origin of the left subclavian artery and the junction with the arterial duct. It cannot be defined until the left subclavian artery achieves its definitive position.
- The right and left pulmonary arteries develop within the pharyngeal mesenchyme, taking their origin from the caudal component of the aortic sac, which gives rise initially to the bilaterally symmetrical arteries of the pulmonary arches.

The artery of the left pulmonary pharyngeal arch has become the arterial duct, while the artery of the left 4th arch has become the transverse aortic arch. Note that the right and left pulmonary arteries develop within the pharyngeal mesenchyma, taking their origin from the caudal component of the aortic sac.

## 26 **Is there an artery of the 5th pharyngeal arch?**

- It is frequent to find aberrant arterial channels in patients with congenitally malformed hearts interpreted in terms of '5th arch arteries'.
- The classical diagram for the developing arteries of the pharyngeal arches does, indeed, illustrate six pairs of bilaterally symmetrical channels (Figure 38).

**Figure 38. Classical 'Rathke' diagram showing the developing arteries of the pharyngeal arches. The purported 5th arch arteries are shown with dotted lines, since their existence remains contentious. The 7th cervical intersegmental arteries (white arrows with red borders) originate from the descending aorta (white star with red borders) and later in development become the subclavian arteries.**

- To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is but a solitary example thus far identified of an attenuating artery of the 5th arch, enclosed within its own segment of pharyngeal mesenchyme (Figure 39).
- Arteries extending between the aortic sac and the descending aorta at the site of the postulated 5th pharyngeal arch are exceedingly rare.

**Figure 39. Reconstruction from the left side of the pharyngeal region of a development human embryo at Carnegie stage 15. It demonstrates attenuation of the left-sided artery that initially coursed between the aortic sac and the descending aorta parallel to the arteries of the left 4th and left pulmonary arches. This arterial channel was embedded within its own segment of pharyngeal mesenchyme. Although initially interpreted as a '5th arch artery', we now consider it better described as a persisting collateral channel.**

- Collateral channels extending between the posterior terminations of the arteries of the 4th and pulmonary arches, in contrast, are found in up to half of all developing mouse embryos, and in a comparable number of human embryos.
- The majority of vascular channels interpreted as persistence of the hypothetical artery of the 5th pharyngeal arch is better explained on the basis of presence of such collateral channels, or else as remodelling of the walls of the aortic sac.

#### 27 **Describe the anatomy of the sinus node and atrial conduction**

- To this day, no evidence has ever been presented to show that postulated internodal atrial conducting tracts or 'specialised internodal pathways' extending through the atrial myocardium to join the sinus and atrioventricular nodes have been identified and isolated from the remainder of the atrial myocardium.
- Instead, histological examination has demonstrated the sinus node to be a well-defined anatomical entity.
- The sinus node can be recognised as occupying the epicardial aspect of the terminal groove at the superior cavoatrial junction, usually located inferior to the crest of the right atrial appendage. Its borders are well demarcated, with no extensions of nodal cardiomyocytes identifiable as extending into the adjacent atrial myocardium (Figure 40).

**Figure 40. A) Operative image demonstrating the superior cavoatrial junction, with terminal groove (yellow dotted line) and anticipated location of the sinus node (yellow oval). B) Histological section (taken from the site of the yellow solid line) demonstrating the sinoatrial node aggregated around a prominent artery. It has a discrete boundary (blue dashed line) from the adjacent myocardium of the terminal crest and superior caval vein. There are no insulated tracts identifiable extending from the node into the adjacent atrial wall.**

• The specialised cardiomyocytes activate the adjacent atrial myocardium at the margins of the node. The prominent myocardial bundles within the right atrium, such as the terminal crest, Bachman's bundle and the margins of the oval fossa, then serve to conduct the impulse generated within the sinus node towards the atrioventricular node, at the apex of the triangle of Koch.

- The pathways within the major myocardial atrial bundles are all composed of ordinary working atrial cardiomyocytes. There is nothing 'specialised', either histologically or electrophysiologically, regarding these pathways.
- Rather, the preferential conduction through the major pathways is dictated by the parallel alignment of the working cardiomyocytes making up the bundles.

#### 28 **Describe the anatomical location of the atrioventricular conduction axis**

- Although the specialised conduction tissues themselves are invisible to the cardiac surgeon, the landmarks regarding their anatomical disposition are now sufficiently robust to permit recognition in all patients with concordant atrioventricular connections.
- The atrioventricular node is located at the apex of the triangle of Koch. The atrial border of the triangle is demarcated by the extension from the Eustachian valve into the myocardium separating the inferior border of the oval fossa from the orifice of the coronary sinus. The ventricular border is formed by the attachment of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. These borders come together at the site of the atrioventricular component of the membranous septum, which forms the apex of the triangle.
- The atrioventricular bundle, or bundle of His, passes through the atrioventricular component of the membranous septum to reach the crest of the muscular ventricular septum. It branches on the crest of the septum, or just below it, into the right and left bundle branches. The right bundle branch then courses through the muscular ventricular septum, emerging on the right ventricular surface in relation to the medial papillary muscle, also known as the muscle of Lancisi, or the conal papillary muscle. A line drawn from the apex of the triangle of Koch to the medial papillary muscle shows the anticipated course of the atrioventricular conduction axis (Figure 41).
- Providing the surgeon keeps all operative manoeuvres outside the boundaries of the triangle of Koch, no damage will be inflicted to the atrioventricular node.
- The landmarks indicating the site of the axis remain consistent in all hearts with deficient ventricular septation when the atrioventricular connections are concordant.
- The connecting atrioventricular node does not occupy the apex of the triangle of Koch in the setting of malalignment between the atrial and

The location of the axis is shown by the red line joining the apex of the triangle of Koch with the medial papillary muscle.**

- ventricular septal components, nor in the setting of double-inlet left ventricle or discordant atrioventricular connections.
- The connecting node is found at the site of insertion of the malaligned ventricular septum to the inferior atrioventricular junction when there is straddling of the tricuspid valve.
- The node is anterior and beneath the mouth of the right atrial appendage in the setting of double-inlet left ventricle or discordant atrioventricular connections.
