# Anomalies of coronary arteries and coronary fistulae

**Carlos M. Mery, Charles D. Fraser, Jr.**

### 1 **What are coronary anomalies?**

• Coronary anomalies represent any variation in the origin, course, branching pattern or termination of the arteries that supply the heart.

### 2 **Describe the normal anatomy of the coronary arteries (Figure 1)**

- The left main and right coronary arteries normally arise separately from perpendicular ostia located at the centre of the left and right aortic sinuses of Valsalva, respectively, approximately 1cm below the sinotubular junction.
- The left main coronary artery divides into the left anterior descending artery that travels on the anterior aspect of the interventricular groove and the circumflex artery that travels on the left atrioventricular groove.
- The right coronary artery travels on the right atrioventricular groove.
- The posterior descending artery, which along with the atrioventricular node artery defines coronary dominance, originates as a terminal branch from the right coronary (75-90%) or the circumflex artery (10-25%).
- Throughout their course, the coronary arteries travel superficially on the epicardium and give branches to the underlying myocardium.

SVC = superior vena cava; RAA = right atrial appendage; IVC = inferior vena cava; RCS = right coronary sinus; RCA = right coronary artery; LCS = left coronary sinus; LMCA = left main coronary artery; LAA = left atrial appendage; Cx = circumflex artery; LAD = left anterior descending artery.**

### 3 **Describe the embryological development of the coronary arteries**

- At the beginning of gestation, the heart derives its blood supply from direct diffusion of blood from the heart tube.
- As the myocardium thickens at around the third week, a series of vascular structures begin to develop on the epicardial surface of the heart. These vascular structures coalesce into a subepicardial primary plexus that prompts the development of vessels throughout the myocardium, driven by hypoxic gradients.

- Later in development, the vessels coalesce into strands that penetrate the aortic root into the correct sinuses. The pulsatile flow that follows prompts the arterialisation of this network.
- The entire process follows a balance between vasculogenesis, angiogenesis and apoptosis.

### 4 **Describe the classification of congenital coronary anomalies**

- There is a large spectrum of congenital coronary anomalies. Based on the International Congenital Heart Surgery Nomenclature and Database Project, they can be classified into:
  - a) anomalous pulmonary origins of the coronary arteries;
  - b) anomalous aortic origins of the coronaries, where the entire coronary circulation originates from the aorta but with an abnormal ostium, an origin from the incorrect aortic sinus or a single coronary artery;
  - c) congenital atresia of the left main coronary artery;
  - d) coronary arteriovenous fistula;
  - e) coronary bridging (abnormal course of a coronary artery within the myocardium);
  - f) coronary aneurysm;
  - g) coronary stenosis.

# 5 **How common are congenital coronary anomalies?**

- Congenital coronary anomalies occur in approximately 0.2-1.6% of the general population.
- The exact incidence of these anomalies is not well known but the most common anomalies are probably:
  - a) coronary fistulae 0.8-1%;
  - b) anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery (AAOCA) 0.2- 0.8%;
  - c) anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) — 1 in to 1 in.

### 6 **What is anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA)?**

• ALCAPA represents a condition where the left main coronary artery originates from the pulmonary artery instead of the aorta (Figure 2).

![](_page_3_Picture_2.jpeg)

**938 Figure 2. Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA). SVC = superior vena cava.** *Reproduced with permission from Texas Children's Hospital, © 2013.*

- It is also known as White-Bland-Garland syndrome.
- Although the most common location of the anomalous coronary is the left posterior sinus of the pulmonary trunk, it can be located anywhere within the pulmonary artery.
- It is the most common cause of myocardial ischaemia in children and carries a mortality of up to 90% in infancy.

### 7 **How does anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery cause ischaemia?**

- During foetal life, pulmonary and aortic pressures are similar. Therefore, the anomalous left coronary artery receives an adequate blood supply of slightly less oxygenated blood.
- As pulmonary vascular resistance drops after birth and the ductus arteriosus closes, the pulmonary arterial pressure decreases, causing a drop in the perfusion pressure of the anomalous left coronary artery.
- As a consequence, the infant develops significant ischaemia, resulting in progressive dilatation and thinning of the ventricle, papillary muscle dysfunction and mitral regurgitation.

• Children that survive this insult may develop significant collaterals from the right coronary artery that will lead to retrograde flow through the anomalous coronary artery into the lower-pressure pulmonary artery and a significant left-to-right shunt.

### 8 **Describe the clinical presentation of <sup>a</sup> patient with anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery**

- The clinical presentation of ALCAPA depends on a series of factors, including the rapidity of closure of the ductus arteriosus, the development of collaterals from the right coronary artery and pulmonary arterial pressure.
- The majority of patients present in infancy with angina associated with feeding (food aversion), sweating, dyspnoea, failure to thrive and other signs of congestive heart failure.
- Patients that survive the initial insult may present later in life with coronary ischaemic symptoms or sudden death.
- Auscultation may reveal a systolic murmur related to mitral insufficiency.
- Electrocardiography will usually reveal signs of left ventricular ischaemia and possibly prior infarction (Figure 3).

• A chest radiograph usually shows cardiomegaly (Figure 4).

- 9 **Describe the imaging studies that are used to confirm the diagnosis of anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery**
- Echocardiography is the mainstay of diagnosis for ALCAPA (Figure 5). It usually reveals a hypokinetic and dilated left ventricle and significant mitral regurgitation.
- Diagnosis is confirmed by the demonstration of an abnormal coronary ostium arising from the pulmonary artery, with retrograde flow through the left coronary artery.
- Magnetic resonance imaging (Figure 6) and computed tomography, especially with 3D reconstruction (Figure 7), can be helpful in cases

- where the echocardiographic diagnosis is not conclusive or where additional anatomical information is required.
- Cardiac catheterisation plays a more limited role in these cases and should be reserved for very special situations (Figure 8).

### 10 **What are the principles of treatment for <sup>a</sup> patient with anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery?**

- There is no role for medical treatment of ALCAPA.
- Multiple surgical palliative procedures have been performed in the past, including ligation of the anomalous coronary artery, pulmonary artery banding and creation of an aortopulmonary window, but are no longer used.
- Based on the experience achieved over the last decade on coronary artery transfer for patients with transposition of the great arteries, the currently accepted optimal management of ALCAPA involves direct reimplantation of the anomalous coronary into the aorta (Figure 9). Most coronary artery patterns are treatable with this technique.

![](_page_8_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Figure 9. Direct reimplantation of an anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) onto the aorta. The anomalous coronary artery is harvested with a large button of pulmonary arterial wall and translocated onto the left aortic sinus. A flap-type incision can be used to avoid changing the direction angle of the coronary artery to prevent kinking. LCA = left coronary artery; RCA = right coronary artery; SVC = superior vena cava.** *Reproduced with permission from Texas Children's Hospital, © 2013.*

• Other techniques, such as the Takeuchi procedure, reconstruction of the proximal coronary with aortic and pulmonary arterial flaps, and coronary artery bypass surgery have been described for anomalous coronaries that insert far away from the aorta or are unfavourable for translocation (Figure 10).

### 11 **What is the Takeuchi repair for anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery?**

- The Takeuchi repair is an operation that has been used for cases with unfavourable coronary anatomy precluding direct implantation of the anomalous coronary artery into the aorta.
- As part of the procedure, an intrapulmonary baffle is created between the aorta and the anomalous coronary artery using pulmonary arterial tissue (Figure 11).
- This repair has been associated with late development of main pulmonary artery stenosis, baffle leaks and mitral regurgitation requiring reoperation.

### 12 **Describe the principles of myocardial protection during surgery on a patient with anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery**

- Myocardial protection is of paramount importance on any procedure performed for ALCAPA, in particular given the presence of myocardial dysfunction in these patients.
- The branch pulmonary arteries should be snared with tourniquets immediately after starting cardiopulmonary bypass in order to prevent run-off from the anomalous left coronary into the pulmonary arteries.
- Cardioplegia is initially administered into the aortic root. Additional cardioplegia can be administered into the left coronary after transection of the pulmonary artery.
- Distension of the left heart should be avoided by adequate venting of the ventricle.

## 13 **What is anomalous aortic origin of <sup>a</sup> coronary artery?**

• Anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery (AAOCA) is a congenital abnormality of the origin or course of a coronary artery that arises from the aorta.

![](_page_11_Picture_4.jpeg)

![](_page_11_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Figure 12. Anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery (AAOCA) arising from the opposite aortic sinus of Valsalva. The anomalous coronary artery, instead of arising from its corresponding sinus, originates from the opposite sinus, close to the other coronary. It is not unusual for these vessels to travel within the wall of the aorta (intramural) for a variable course.** *Reproduced with permission from Texas Children's Hospital, © 2013.*

- It is believed that AAOCA and other coronary anomalies are the second most common cause of sudden cardiac death in children and young adults.
- Anomalous coronaries that originate from the opposite aortic sinus of Valsalva, which includes anomalous right coronary artery from the left coronary sinus (ARCA) and anomalous left coronary artery from the right coronary sinus (ALCA), may be associated with the highest risk (Figure 12). These vessels tend to have a variable intramural course within the aortic wall.
- The real prevalence of these anomalies is unknown but it is believed to be ~0.7%.
- ARCA seems to be more prevalent than ALCA, although ALCA seems to carry a higher risk.

### 14 **What are the pathophysiological mechanisms believed to cause sudden cardiac death in patients with anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery?**

- The exact mechanism related to sudden cardiac death in patients with AAOCA is not clear.
- Most patients with AAOCA that suffer from sudden cardiac death, do so during or immediately after strenuous exercise.
- The type of exercise usually related to sudden cardiac death on AAOCA is of the dynamic or aerobic type, such as football, basketball, athletics or swimming. This type of exercise is usually related to increased heart rate, cardiac output and systolic blood pressure, and decreased systemic vascular resistance and diastolic blood pressure.
- Proposed pathophysiological mechanisms include:
  - a) compression of an intramural segment within the aortic wall;
  - b) stenosis or a slit-like ostium of the anomalous coronary causing coronary insufficiency (Figure 13);
  - c) acute angulation of the anomalous coronary;
  - d) compression of the anomalous coronary by the aorta and the pulmonary artery as it passes between them (interarterial segment);
  - e) kinking of the coronary artery as it anchors into the myocardium;
  - f) coronary artery spasm.

**Figure 13. Intra-operative photograph of a patient with anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery. The anomalous right coronary originates from the left coronary sinus of Valsalva, close to the origin of the left coronary (arrow). The anomalous coronary has a slit-like ostium and a long intramural segment (delimited by the transmural polypropylene suture placed through the left coronary sinus) before exiting the aorta.** *Reproduced with permission from Texas Children's Hospital, © 2013.*

### 15 **Describe the clinical presentation of <sup>a</sup> patient with anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery**

- The clinical presentation is variable with approximately 30-50% of patients having symptoms, including syncope, chest pain or dyspnoea.
- In some patients, an episode of actual or aborted sudden cardiac death may be the first clinical presentation.
- An increasing number of patients are being found to have AAOCA incidentally during echocardiography or other imaging studies.
- Some patients with AAOCA are now being diagnosed through screening programs.

### 16 **Describe the imaging modalities used to diagnose and define anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery**

• Echocardiography can allow identification of the sinus of origin of the coronary arteries but does not provide the necessary anatomical detail in AAOCA. Its main use is to rule out other associated intracardiac abnormalities.

• Magnetic resonance imaging allows for static evaluation of the origin and course of the coronary arteries without ionising radiation (Figure 14). It also provides information on myocardial function, perfusion, viability and other intracardiac anomalies.

![](_page_14_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Figure 14. Magnetic resonance imaging scan of a patient with anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery. An anomalous right coronary artery (arrow) can be seen originating from the left coronary sinus of Valsalva.** *Reproduced with permission from Texas Children's Hospital, © 2013.*

• Computed tomography (CT) scanning has better spatial resolution and can provide more detailed anatomy of the origin and course of the coronary arteries in AAOCA, at the expense of a small amount of ionising radiation (Figure 15). Using complex reconstruction techniques, this modality allows the identification of interarterial and intramural segments, as well as good definition of the anatomy of the coronary ostia.

![](_page_15_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 15. Computed tomography scan of a patient with anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery, demonstrating: A) and B) an anomalous right coronary artery (arrow) arising from the left coronary sinus of Valsalva, next to the origin of the left coronary artery (arrowhead); and C) an intramural segment of the anomalous coronary artery; D) 3D reconstruction with virtual angioscopy is used to define the anatomy of the left (arrowhead) and right (arrow) coronary ostia, as well as the detection of dynamic changes of the ostium across the cardiac cycle.** *Reproduced with permission from Texas Children's Hospital, © 2013.*

- Intravascular ultrasound is being increasingly used, mainly in adults, to determine any intramural course in AAOCA.
- Coronary angiography is reserved for cases where coronary atherosclerotic disease is suspected. It may provide some information regarding the ostium of the anomalous coronary artery but it does not help to determine any intramural course.

# 17 Which patients with anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery are at the highest risk of sudden cardiac death?

- The exact risk of sudden cardiac death in patients with AAOCA is unknown.
- It is believed that patients with ALCA are at a higher risk of sudden cardiac death than patients with ARCA.
- The risk conferred by different anatomical characteristics of AAOCA to the risk of death is not clear but patients with AAOCA from the incorrect sinus of Valsalva in which the anomalous coronary artery travels with an interarterial course, and in particular with an intramural segment, are believed to be at highest risk.
- Patients that present with symptoms or aborted sudden cardiac death are also probably at a higher risk.

# 18 What is the role of exercise stress testing in anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery?

- The role of exercise stress testing in AAOCA has not been well defined, especially as some patients with normal stress testing have gone on to develop symptoms or even suffered from sudden cardiac death within 6 months of the normal study.
- Patients with an abnormal stress test should probably undergo intervention but a negative stress test cannot be used to predict the absence of sudden cardiac death in the future.

# 19 What are the surgical options in a patient with anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery?

- Unroofing of an intramural segment, with or without takedown of the aortic valve.
- Coronary translocation.
- Neo-ostium creation.
- Pulmonary artery translocation.
- Coronary artery bypass surgery.

# 20 What are the principles of unroofing of an anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery with an intramural segment (Figures 16 and 17)?

- The aortic root is opened and the coronary ostia inspected.
- The intramural segment of the coronary is defined using a coronary probe.

![](_page_17_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 16. Unroofing procedure for anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery: A) the anomalous right coronary artery originates from the left aortic sinus and passes through a small slit-like orifice and with a long intramural segment; B) the intramural segment is incised; and C) the unroofed tissue is debrided to create a large ostium that allows unobstructed flow without any residual intramural segment.** *Reproduced with permission from Texas Children's Hospital, © 2013.*

![](_page_17_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 17. Operative image showing an unroofed anomalous right coronary artery. The vessel had a slitlike ostium and a long intramural segment that was unroofed. The edges of the unroofed segment were tacked with interrupted sutures.** *Reproduced with permission from Texas Children's Hospital, © 2013.*

- Dissecting the anomalous coronary artery outside of the aorta and placing a transmural aortic suture at the site where the anomalous coronary exits the aorta can be useful to define the length and direction of the intramural segment.
- The intramural segment is incised up to the point where the coronary exits the aorta.
- The intramural segment is then debrided, leaving a large ostium without an intramural portion.
- Tacking stitches may be placed on the unroofed segment, especially if the unroofing incision was taken beyond the intramural coronary and outside of the aorta.
- 21 **Describe the principles of surgery when the intramural segment of an anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery travels behind the commissure of the aortic valve**
- If the intramural segment travels behind the commissure of the aortic valve, standard unroofing cannot be performed.
- Although some authors have suggested taking down the commissure, unroofing the segment and reattaching the aortic valve, this technique may injure the aortic valve with reports of late aortic valve dysfunction.
- If there is a long intramural segment on the correct aortic sinus beyond the commissure of the aortic valve, a neo-ostium can be created on the correct aortic sinus (Figure 18).

![](_page_18_Picture_10.jpeg)

**Figure 18. Neo-ostium creation technique used when the intramural segment of an anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery travels behind the commissure of the aortic valve: A) a coronary probe is used to define the intramural segment; and B) a separate orifice is made on the correct aortic sinus beyond the commissure of the aortic valve.** *Reproduced with permission from Texas Children's Hospital, © 2013.*

• An alternative strategy is to translocate the coronary artery by dividing the vessel once it exits the aortic wall and reimplanting it on the correct sinus of Valsalva (Figure 19).

![](_page_19_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 19. Coronary translocation technique used for anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery. The anomalous coronary artery is divided as it comes out of the aortic wall and anastomosed to the aorta on the correct sinus of Valsalva. Care must be made not to distort or kink the vessel.** *Reproduced with permission from Texas Children's Hospital, © 2013.*

### 22 **What other techniques can be used to treat anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery?**

- Coronary translocation can also be used in cases where there is no intramural segment to unroof or when the intramural segment is short.
- Some authors have performed lateral or anterior translocations of the pulmonary artery in order to move this vessel and prevent compression of the interarterial segment of an AAOCA, particularly in cases of a single coronary artery.
- Coronary artery bypass grafting surgery should be reserved for very limited cases in older patients. It is not an ideal solution since the anomalous coronary has a normal blood flow most of the time, predisposing it to thrombosis of the conduit from competitive flow.
- Coronary stenting of the intramural segment has been used by some authors in older patients.

### 23 **Should patients with anomalous aortic origin of <sup>a</sup> coronary artery be exercise-restricted?**

- It is not clear whether exercise restriction reduces the risk of sudden cardiac death in patients with AAOCA.
- Since most patients that have died from AAOCA have done so while exercising, most authors suggest that there is a role for exercise restriction in AAOCA.
- Patients that are considered at risk of sudden cardiac death and those awaiting surgical intervention should probably be exercise restricted.

# 24 **What is <sup>a</sup> coronary fistula?**

- An arteriovenous coronary fistula is a communication between a main coronary artery or one of its branches and a cardiac chamber (most commonly the right ventricle or right atrium) or the pulmonary artery.
- Approximately two thirds of coronary fistulae are of congenital origin and believed to be related to the persistence of intramyocardial sinusoids.

### 25 **Describe the clinical presentation of <sup>a</sup> patient with <sup>a</sup> coronary fistula**

- Coronary fistulae can cause myocardial ischaemia by creating a steal phenomenon and increasing the volume load of the left heart due to a net left-to-right shunt (or systemic to pulmonary shunt).
- Patients tend to present in the third decade of life with angina, dyspnoea, arrhythmias or congestive heart failure.
- A continuous 'machinery' murmur is also often heard on examination.
- An electrocardiogram may reveal ischaemic changes, arrhythmias or chamber dilatation.
- A chest radiograph will likely show cardiomegaly and possibly increased pulmonary vascular markings in cases of high-volume shunts.

### 26 **Describe the imaging modalities that are used to diagnose a coronary fistula**

- Colour flow Doppler echocardiography is a very sensitive study to define coronary artery fistulae.
- Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scanning can be used as adjuvant studies to define the anatomy of a coronary fistula.

• The gold standard imaging study for coronary fistulae is coronary angiography, which is useful not only to define the exact location of the fistula, haemodynamics and degree of left-to-right shunting, but also the potential for treatment (Figure 20).

This was associated with significant left-to-right shunting and a Qp: Qs ratio of 2.4:1.** *Images courtesy of Dr. Dhaval Parekh. Reproduced with permission from Texas Children's Hospital, © 2013.*

### 27 **Describe the principles of managing <sup>a</sup> patient with <sup>a</sup> coronary fistula**

- Treatment is indicated for all symptomatic patients with a coronary fistula.
- The treatment of a fistula in the absence of symptoms is controversial.
- Depending on the anatomy, a coronary fistula can be treated with interventional transcatheter techniques or surgically.
- Regardless of the technique, the goal of treatment is to close the fistula without compromising coronary blood flow. As such, the details of the fistula and its relationship with the coronary artery and the cardiac chambers should be defined prior to the intervention.
- Most coronary fistulae are now treated with interventional transcatheter techniques, including coil embolisation or device closure (Figure 21).

- Surgical interventions for a coronary fistula, with unfavourable anatomy for interventional closure, include:
  - a) extracardiac oversewing of the fistula;
  - b) transcardiac closure (using cardiopulmonary bypass);
  - c) coronary aneurysmorrhaphy with transarterial closure of the fistula;
  - d) ligation with coronary bypass grafting.

## 28 **What is <sup>a</sup> coronary aneurysm?**

- A coronary aneurysm is defined as a saccular or fusiform dilatation of a coronary artery beyond 1.5 times the normal size of the coronary artery.
- Depending on their size, aneurysms can be classified into:
  - a) small (<5mm);
  - b) medium (5-8mm);
  - c) giant (>8mm).
- The most common sites of coronary aneurysms in children are the proximal vessels (right and left main coronary arteries, and the proximal left anterior descending artery).

## 29 **What is the aetiology of <sup>a</sup> coronary aneurysm?**

- Coronary aneurysms are caused by destruction of the musculoelastic components of the coronary artery wall resulting in dilatation of the vessel.
- Although some aneurysms may be congenital and associated with connective tissue disorders, most are acquired.
- Most coronary aneurysms in adults are associated with atherosclerosis.
- The most common cause of a coronary aneurysm in children is Kawasaki disease.

### 30 **What is Kawasaki disease?**

- Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis of capillaries and small arteries that affects mainly young children and is also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome.
- It usually presents with fever, lymphadenopathy, a polymorphic exanthem and mucocutaneous erythema.
- Although the actual cause of Kawasaki disease is unknown, it may be partially related to an infectious agent.
- Up to 25% of patients with Kawasaki disease that are not treated with intravenous gamma-globulin and aspirin can develop coronary aneurysms.
- Aneurysms, in particular small aneurysms, will regress spontaneously in approximately 50% of the patients. The other 50% will have persistent changes that may advance to coronary artery stenosis and aneurysm thrombosis.

### 31 **What are the principles of diagnosing <sup>a</sup> coronary aneurysm?**

- Coronary aneurysms can present with angina, myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure, related to thrombosis or coronary artery stenosis.
- Many aneurysms are asymptomatic and identified by imaging techniques during follow-up of children with a diagnosis of Kawasaki disease.
- Echocardiography is usually the first-line imaging technique and is able to clearly define proximal aneurysms.
- Coronary angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosis and to define the presence of any related thrombosis or stenosis (Figure 22).

### 32 **Describe the principles of management for <sup>a</sup> patient with a coronary aneurysm**

- The treatment of children with established coronary aneurysms is challenging.
- Aspirin and warfarin anticoagulation are used to prevent thrombosis of the aneurysms, and limit the incidence of subsequent thromboembolic events.
- Patients with evidence of myocardial ischaemia or with significant proximal coronary stenosis may benefit from coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.
- Patency of an internal mammary artery graft in children has been reported as 78% at 10 years, compared to only 36% with saphenous vein grafts. Moreover, áå ëáíì internal mammary arteries have shown proportionate growth with the patient.

• The role of percutaneous transcatheter techniques for the treatment of coronary aneurysms in children is not well defined.
