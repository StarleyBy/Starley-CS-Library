# Surgical palliation in congenital heart disease

**Vanessa J. C. Rogers, Nigel E. Drury**

- 1 **What is palliation in the context of congenital heart disease?**
- Palliation represents the alleviation of symptoms without correction of the underlying pathology.
- It is used to manage symptoms when total surgical correction or repair is not possible or is not indicated at the present time.
- Depending on the underlying congenital cardiac lesion, it can be used to:
  - a) increase or provide a reliable pulmonary blood flow, such as with a Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt;
  - b) restrict or prevent excessive pulmonary blood flow, such as with pulmonary artery (PA) banding;
  - c) allow increased mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, such as with an atrial septostomy or septectomy;
  - d) prepare for or allow growth to enable future surgical repair.

## 2 **Describe the strategies that can be used to increase or provide reliable pulmonary blood flow**

- Systemic to pulmonary artery shunts, including a:
  - a) Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt (classic and modified) also known as a Blalock-Thomas-Taussig (BTT) shunt;
  - b) central systemic to pulmonary artery shunt;
  - c) right ventricle (RV) to pulmonary artery (PA) shunt (Sano shunt);
  - d) classic Glenn shunt;
  - e) bidirectional Glenn shunt.
- Maintaining patency of the ductus arteriosus by:
  - a) stenting;
  - b) prostaglandin infusion.

# 3 Describe the characteristics of an ideal systemic to pulmonary artery shunt

- Suitable for all anatomical variations.
- Technically simple to perform.
- Minimal early and late morbidity and mortality.
- Increased but not excessive pulmonary blood flow, which may lead to congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.
- Maintains adequate preload and afterload, and therefore coronary blood flow.
- Good patency and longevity, maintaining adequate pulmonary blood flow with the growth of the child.
- Easy to close at the time of total repair.
- Leaves no residual defect after closure.

## 4 Describe the principles of a Blalock-Taussia shunt

- A classic BT shunt consists of an end-to-side anastomosis of the subclavian artery to the pulmonary artery on the opposite side to the aortic arch. It was originally described on the left but is classically performed on the right (Figure 1A).
- A modified BT shunt uses a prosthetic interposition graft between the subclavian artery and the ipsilateral pulmonary artery to augment pulmonary blood flow (Figure 1B).

**Figure 1.** A) Classic right Blalock-Taussig shunt. B) Modified left Blalock-Taussig shunt. PA = pulmonary artery; Ao = aorta.

#### It can be performed via a:

- a) median sternotomy;
- b) thoracotomy which is usually on the right (opposite side to the aortic arch), with ligation and division of the azygos vein, thereby reducing the risk of adhesions for a future midline approach.

# Describe the conditions in which a Blalock-Taussig shunt may be used

- Tetralogy of Fallot (and pulmonary atresia of the tetralogy type).
- Tricuspid atresia.
- Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum.
- Hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
- Other rarer complex anomalies with restricted pulmonary blood flow.

# What are the advantages and disadvantages of the classic Blalock-Taussig shunt?

#### Advantages:

- a) predictable flow as the diameter of the subclavian artery limits excessive pulmonary blood flow;
- b) does not require the use of prosthetic material;
- c) potential adaptive growth with the child.

#### Disadvantages:

- a) shunt thrombosis due to limited diameter;
- b) involves sacrifice of the subclavian artery, with the potential for arm ischaemia;
- c) requires extensive surgical dissection which may result in phrenic nerve injury.

# What factors should be considered in the postoperative management of a patient with a Blalock-Taussig shunt?

 Anticoagulation, which is initially with heparin, then aspirin, to reduce the risk of early or late shunt thrombosis.

- Maintain a haemoglobin of 140-160g/L, to ensure a higher viscosity of blood.
- Maintain adequate mean and diastolic pressures with inotropes and gentle filling, to prevent myocardial ischaemia due to coronary steal.

## 8 **What are the complications of <sup>a</sup> Blalock-Taussig shunt?**

- Shunt thrombosis or a shunt too small which will result in a:
  - a) fall in the arterial oxygen saturation levels;
  - b) loss of the shunt murmur, which is normally auscultated over the ipsilateral 2nd intercostal space.

Its management should involve excluding other causes of decreased oxygen saturation levels by performing an echocardiogram. If the shunt has been clipped, removing the clip may increase pulmonary blood flow and improve oxygenation. If there is thrombosis in the shunt, it must be refashioned urgently.

- Shunt too large which will result in:
  - a) pulmonary over-circulation;
  - b) arterial oxygen saturations >90%;
  - c) low diastolic pressure resulting in pulmonary congestion (often one-sided), systemic hypoperfusion, increasing arterial lactate and oliguria.

Its management should involve reducing the inspired oxygen concentration and ventilator rate to allow the arterial carbon dioxide levels to rise slightly, and considering transfusion to increase the blood viscosity. The shunt may also be clipped to reduce its diameter.

### 9 **Describe the other types of systemic to pulmonary arterial shunts (Figure 2)**

- A Potts shunt (also known as a Potts-Smith-Gibson shunt) connects the descending aorta to the left pulmonary artery. It is not widely used, as it is technically difficult to take down and is associated with a high incidence of pulmonary hypertension.
- A Waterston-Cooley shunt is a side-to-side anastomosis between the ascending aorta and right pulmonary artery, which is either extrapericardial (Waterston) or intrapericardial (Cooley). It has similar

- properties to the Potts shunt with difficulty in determining the correct size of the anastomosis, potentially resulting in pulmonary overcirculation to a single lung, and is technically difficult to take down.
- A central shunt is the term used to describe a short prosthetic tube graft between the ascending aorta and the main pulmonary artery. It is mainly used in small neonates, especially when the pulmonary arteries are small, and provides 'equal' blood flow to both lungs, with a low occlusion rate and is readily repairable. However, it requires entry into the pericardium and is not suitable for patients without a patent ductus arteriosus or other source of pulmonary blood flow.
- A Melbourne shunt (also known as a Mee shunt) is a central end-toside shunt used to connect the transected main pulmonary artery to the ascending aorta. It is typically used in pulmonary atresia with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) and confluent but diminutive pulmonary arteries, to encourage sufficient pulmonary artery growth to enable a complete repair.

#### 10 **What are the parameters that govern the flow in <sup>a</sup> modified Blalock-Taussig shunt?**

- A modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (mBT shunt) is a procedure whereby a synthetic shunt is fashioned between the systemic and pulmonary circulation, commonly using a Gore-Tex® tube from the subclavian artery to the pulmonary artery.
- It is a palliative procedure indicated in a subset of patients with cyanotic heart disease not amenable to primary repair at the time of presentation.
- As over- and under-shunting are frequently seen in the postoperative period, an understanding of the parameters that guide shunt flow help to manage these situations.
- The parameters that govern the flow in an mBT shunt are defined by Poiseuille's law:

$$Q = \frac{(\Delta P)}{R}$$

and since R = 
$$\frac{(8 \times \eta \times L)}{(\pi \times r^4)}$$

$$Q = \frac{\Delta P \times \pi \times r^4}{8 \times \eta \times L}$$

where Q = flow across the shunt; DP = change in pressure across the shunt; R = resistance of the shunt, r = radius of the shunt; h = viscosity of blood flowing through the shunt; L = length of the shunt.

- Increasing the pressure gradient across the shunt increases the flow, which can be achieved by:
  - a) increasing the pressure in the systemic compartment, such as with vasoconstrictors;
  - b) decreasing the pressure in the pulmonary compartment, such as with pulmonary vasodilators.
- If the radius of the shunt halves, the resistance increases by a factor of 16 and the flow decreases by a factor of 16.
- On the other hand, if the length of the shunt halves, the resistance halves and the flow doubles.
- Increasing blood viscosity by increasing the haematocrit value, results in a decrease in the flow across the shunt.

• As flow through the mBT shunt predominantly takes place during diastole, over-shunting can also be managed by reducing the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle, such as by increasing the heart rate.

# 11 **Describe the principles of <sup>a</sup> Glenn shunt**

• A classic Glenn shunt represents an end-to-side anastomosis between the superior vena cava (SVC) and the right pulmonary artery, with disconnection of the right pulmonary artery from the main pulmonary trunk (Figure 3).

![](_page_6_Picture_5.jpeg)

**Figure 3. Classic Glenn shunt. PA = pulmonary artery; RPA = right pulmonary artery; SVC = superior vena cava; RA = right atrium.**

- It is used to increase pulmonary blood flow in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease.
- In a bidirectional Glenn shunt (or bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt — BCPS), the SVC is disconnected from the right atrium and anastomosed end-to-side to the right pulmonary artery, enabling venous blood from the SVC to flow to both the right and left lungs (Figure 4).

![](_page_7_Picture_2.jpeg)

**1080 Figure 4. Bidirectional Glenn shunt. PA = pulmonary artery; RPA = right pulmonary artery; SVC = superior vena cava; RA = right atrium.**

- Both the classic Glenn and BCPS enable venous blood to drain into the pulmonary circulation and therefore do not cause the increase in ventricular workload or volume loading seen with systemic to pulmonary arterial shunts.
- A BCPS is often performed as the second stage of a three-stage palliation for functionally univentricular conditions, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome or tricuspid atresia, to reduce the volume loading on the ventricle and improve oxygen saturations.
- A BCPS may also be used as a definitive procedure in patients who are unsuitable for a Fontan completion or as a one-and-a-half repair in those with a functionally inadequate right ventricle (for example, Ebstein's anomaly or hypoplasia of the right ventricle).

#### 12 **What are the principles of management following <sup>a</sup> bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt?**

- Most patients are more stable with a Glenn shunt than they were beforehand and the inter-stage mortality prior to Fontan completion is low.
- As the child becomes more active, progressing from crawling to walking to running, oxygen desaturation becomes more severe,

- especially during exercise and is commonly used as an indication for the Fontan procedure.
- Some children may develop progressive cyanosis due to the development of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations resulting in a right-to-left shunt. This is thought to be due to a lack of the so called 'hepatic factor', as the hepatic effluent passes into the systemic circulation bypassing the lungs, although the precise mechanism is yet to be elucidated. These malformations typically regress and the cyanosis resolves following Fontan completion.

# 13 **Describe the principles of pulmonary artery banding**

- PA banding is indicated in patients with a large left-to-right shunt and pulmonary over-circulation, who are unable to undergo full correction, including:
  - a) large or multiple VSDs;
  - b) atrioventricular septal defect;
  - c) tricuspid atresia;
  - d) hypoplastic left heart syndrome (as part of a hybrid procedure).
- In these cases, it is rarely a definitive solution but can remain in place for prolonged periods of time (months or even years).
- The reasons for employing a staged approach (pulmonary artery banding followed by repair and debanding) include:
  - a) small body size contraindicating complex intracardiac repair;
  - b) severe comorbidities contraindicating the use of cardiopulmonary bypass;
  - c) use of pulmonary artery branch banding in the context of ductdependent complex lesions.
- PA banding is also used in patients to train the subpulmonary ventricle prior to an arterial switch in transposition (late referral) or double switch in congenitally corrected transposition.
- A PA band is appropriately sized using Trusler's formula:

Band circumference = 20mm + 1mm/kg of body weight

### 14 **What are the complications of pulmonary artery banding?**

• Pulmonary artery impingement or stenosis — which can result in the underdevelopment of the affected lung, if left untreated.

- Pulmonary valve distortion which can result in valve dysplasia that may affect future surgical repair, if left untreated.
- Coronary artery impingement which may occur if the band is placed very proximally and the coronary circulation is anomalous, with the circumflex coronary artery most commonly affected.
- Pulmonary artery erosion which rarely leads to significant haemorrhage because of the underlying scarring and fibrosis.
- Pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm.
- Ineffectual PA banding with unrestricted pulmonary blood flow which may lead to ongoing pulmonary congestion and pulmonary vascular disease.

## 15 **Describe the principles of an atrial septectomy or septostomy**

- Increased mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood can be achieved by creating an opening in the atrial septum, using a:
  - a) surgical atrial septectomy;
  - b) catheter balloon atrial septostomy (Rashkind procedure).
- It is indicated in patients with:
  - a) transposition of the great arteries with an intact atrial septum or restrictive atrial septal defect (ASD);
  - b) hypoplastic left heart syndrome;
  - c) total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (TAPVD) with a restrictive ASD;
  - d) tricuspid atresia with a restrictive ASD;
  - e) pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum;
  - f) univentricular heart, as part of a Glenn or Fontan procedure;
  - g) extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO) to decompress the left atrium.

## 16 **Describe the principles of <sup>a</sup> Fontan circulation**

• A Fontan circulation is a surgically-constructed pathway in which the functioning ventricle is used to support the systemic circulation, with passive blood flow in series to the lungs, via a superior cavopulmonary shunt (Glenn) and an inferior caval connection (Fontan), either as a direct anastomosis (atriopulmonary connection or baffled lateral tunnel) or using a prosthetic conduit (extracardiac total cavopulmonary connection) (Figure 5).

![](_page_10_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 5. A fenestrated Fontan circulation following a three-stage repair for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. RPA = right pulmonary artery; LPA = left pulmonary artery; SVC = superior vena cava; Ao = aorta; TV = tricuspid valve; RV = right ventricle; IVC = inferior vena cava.**

• In most cases, a fenestration is used as a 'blow-off valve' to mitigate against a rise in systemic venous pressure, at the expense of reduced systemic oxygen saturations.

## 17 **What are the indications for <sup>a</sup> Fontan circulation?**

- Any functionally univentricular malformation in which one of the ventricles is insufficiently developed or compromised, such that it is unable to support an adequate cardiac output.
- These include hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tricuspid atresia, double-inlet left ventricle, and unbalanced atrioventricular septal defect.

# 18 What are the physiological characteristics associated with favourable instigation and good prognosis for a Fontan circulation?

- Low transpulmonary gradient, ideally <12mmHg.</li>
- Competent atrioventricular valve in the systemic pathway.
- Unobstructed outflow in the systemic pathway.
- Preserved systemic ventricular function, with an adequate enddiastolic volume and a good ejection fraction.
- Low venous pressure in the Fontan pathway.
- Normal or near-normal arterial oxygen saturations (>93%).

# 19 What palliative procedures can be used to manage congenital mitral stenosis?

- It is important to consider the nature of the mitral stenosis and associated anomalies when considering treatment.
- Palliation is common due to the limited scope of prostheses for mitral valve replacement and includes:
  - a) balloon mitral valvuloplasty which can relieve the stenosis and is less invasive;
  - b) surgical mitral valvuloplasty which tends to be favoured for supravalvular stenosis.
- If mitral stenosis is associated with a small ventricular chamber, a univentricular palliation pathway may offer the best prognosis.

# 20 What palliative procedures can be used to manage congenital aortic stenosis?

- Balloon or surgical valvotomy may be used.
- Both procedures can relieve the stenosis but the need for further intervention, including repeat balloon or surgical valvotomy, prosthetic valve replacement or the Ross procedure, is high, especially in those presenting as a neonate.
- Similarly, if aortic stenosis is associated with aortic or ventricular dysplasia, staged univentricular palliation may be the best option.

# 21 Describe palliative hybrid procedures that can be used in congenital heart disease

 Hybrid cardiac surgery is defined as combined catheter and surgical interventions, either at one sitting or sequentially within 24 hours.

- It is most commonly considered as an alternative to the Norwood procedure for stage I palliation in neonates with hypoplastic left heart syndrome but requires a comprehensive stage II repair.
- Hybrid procedures involving maintaining patency of the ductus arteriosus and restricting pulmonary blood flow are used to treat non-HLHS lesions, where severe comorbidities and low birth weight make a full repair in one stage unsuitable, such as:
  - a) interrupted aortic arch plus truncus arteriosus;
  - b) truncus arteriosus with a normal aortic arch;
  - c) Taussig-Bing anomaly;
  - d) very small (<2.5kg) neonate;
  - e) very ill neonate.
- It involves stenting of the patent ductus arteriosus to secure systemic blood flow, PA banding to prevent pulmonary over-circulation, and in some patients an atrial septostomy or septectomy.
- A hybrid approach may also be used for:
  - a) multiple VSDs with surgical repair of a perimembranous defect and percutaneous closure of muscular defects;
  - b) transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement via a direct surgical sheath.
