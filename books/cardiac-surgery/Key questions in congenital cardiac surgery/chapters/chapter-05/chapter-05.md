## 1 **Describe the principles of computed tomography**

- A computed tomography (CT) scan combines a series of X-ray images taken from different projections and the attenuation data are used to reconstruct cross-sectional images.
- Different tissues and organs are differentiated by their inherent variation in attenuation; bone has high attenuation, air has the lowest attenuation and water has intermediate attenuation.
- Iodinated contrast agents are used to enhance visualisation of the blood pool, such as vessels and body organs.
- CT plays an important role in the characterisation of congenital cardiovascular anomalies and complications post-corrective surgery.
- CT exposes patients to potentially harmful ionising radiation, especially the potential risk of cancer. The Ionising Radiation Medical Exposure Regulations (IRMER) has set out responsibilities for practitioners and operators to ensure that the benefits of the exposure to ionising radiation outweigh the risks, and that the radiation dose is kept 'as low as reasonably practicable' for their intended use.
- The main risks of exposure to iodinated contrast medium are:
  - a) allergic reaction, with anaphylactic reaction reported in 24 per 1000;
  - b) renal impairment, which occurs in <2% of patients. In view of this, screening of renal function should take place prior to CT scanning, especially in patients with a history of kidney disease or diabetes, and older patients. Adequate hydration is helpful to reduce the risk from contrast-induced renal impairment.

#### 2 **Describe the principles of magnetic resonance imaging**

- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses a strong magnetic field and radiofrequency waves to produce images of body tissues.
- The signal detected by MRI is generated from the magnetisation of atoms with odd numbers of protons or neutrons within tissues (mainly protons).
- Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) plays an important role in the detection of congenital anomalies and associated lesions. CMR allows non-invasive assessment of the ventricular function and shunt flow. CMR is widely used for the follow-up of left or right ventricular function, size and shunt studies in repaired and unrepaired congenital lesions and planning the timing of surgery.
- Although MRI is regarded as a safe investigation, there is a potential risk of the magnetic field in patients with metal and non-conditional implantable devices.
- The risk of anaphylactic reaction to contrast (gadolinium) injections is present but rare (1:10,000).
- Patients with renal failure are at increased risk of developing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) following contrast injection. This condition involves fibrosis of the skin, joints, eyes, and internal organs. The reported cases of NSF have significantly declined in recent years and patients with reduced renal function are often offered alternative contrast agents.

#### 3 **What are the principles of assessing coronary anomalies with radiological imaging?**

- ECG-gated CT angiography is the non-invasive modality of choice for the detection of the origin and assessing the course and termination of coronary artery anomalies (Figures 1 and 2), with the ability to define related structures and coronary artery fistulae (Figure 3).
- CT is also a reliable technique for detecting myocardial bridges (Figure 4).
- In patients following repair of coronary anomalies, CT allows the evaluation of the anastomoses and can detect the presence of any restenosis of the grafts.
- Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging enables assessment of ventricular function and myocardial viability, and valvular function in patients with coronary anomalies.

**Figure 1. Gated computed tomography coronary angiography curved multiplanar reconstruction demonstrating: A) an anomalous origin of the left main coronary artery (arrow) from the non-coronary sinus, with proximal luminal attenuation; B) anomalous origin of the left circumflex artery (arrow) from the right coronary sinus, adjacent to the origin of the right coronary artery, with a retro-aortic course and calcified atheroma in its mid segment; C) anomalous origin of a non-dominant right coronary artery (arrow head) from the left coronary sinus with an obstructive noncalcified plaque (arrow); and D) anomalous origin of a dominant right coronary artery (arrow head) from the left coronary sinus, with a nonobstructive calcified plaque (arrow).**

- The assessment of the coronary anomalies themselves by cardiac MRI is challenging due to limited spatial resolution and data acquisition time. Techniques, such as navigated 3D whole heart magnetic resonance angiography, may allow adequate visualisation of coronary anomalies. Nonetheless, it can be difficult to comment on ostial narrowing due to less spatial resolution.
- Simple steady-state free precision (SSFP) or black blood imaging in a routine MRI is usually able to show the origin and proximal course of the artery.

- MRI is also useful as a follow-up after repair of anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) for evaluation of baffles used in the Takeuchi technique or direct reimplantation procedures in assessing the baffle confluency and checking the anastomotic site and reimplantation to the aortic root.
- Stress MRI with adenosine is helpful in the detection of ischaemia in coronary anomalies and in a postoperative patient.

#### 4 **What are the principles of assessing an atrial septal defect with radiological imaging?**

• Chest radiography in adults with a haemodynamically significant atrial septal defect (ASD) usually reveals cardiac enlargement, right atrial dilatation, prominent central pulmonary arteries and pulmonary vascular markings.

- MRI is indicated in patients with poor echocardiographic acoustic windows, for anatomical assessment of surrounding structures and associated anomalies, and where there is a need for non-invasive quantification of the shunt.
- MRI also allows accurate assessment of ventricular volumes and function, with phase-contrast MRI allowing non-invasive calculation of systemic and pulmonary blood flow.
- CT scanning (Figure 5) plays a complementary diagnostic role in the management of an ASD, including:
  - a) assessment of associated anomalies, such as anomalous pulmonary venous return;
  - b) pre-operative planning, such as assessment of vascular access; characterisation of the size, location and the shape of the defect that can be used for device selection; and assessment of coronary arteries in older patients;
  - c) assessment of the coronary arteries.

**Figure 5. ECG-gated computed tomography (CT) angiography demonstrating a large secundum atrial septal defect (arrow), with shunting from the left to right atrium causing mixing of contrast, and a dilated hypertrophied right ventricle with flattening of the interventricular septum. Unless technically intended, shunts should be suspected when dense contrast is seen in all heart chambers on CT angiography.**

- CT scanning may also incidentally diagnose an ASD or patent foramen ovale (PFO).
- Equal opacification of the right and left heart chambers on CT may hinder the diagnosis of a significant shunt.

#### 5 **What are the principles of assessing <sup>a</sup> ventricular septal defect with radiological imaging?**

- Chest radiograph usually demonstrates dilatation of the central pulmonary arteries, increased pulmonary vascularity and an increased cardiothoracic ratio.
- MRI is the modality of choice in the assessment of pulmonary and systemic blood flow measurement, with the ratio providing an insight into the haemodynamic significance of the septal defects.
- MRI is also the gold standard for assessing LV function and size and therefore can help in the decision making for VSD closure.
- In patients who develop arrhythmias following VSD repair, late gadolinium MRI can localise the scar, which can be subsequently ablated.
- Although CT scanning (Figure 6) is not the primary imaging modality for VSDs, it can provide a complementary assessment of the type, location, size and number of the VSD(s), as well as the chamber sizes, right or left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, and coexisting cardiac abnormalities, such as tetralogy of Fallot.

**Figure 6. ECG-gated computed tomography angiography demonstrating: A) a membranous ventricular septal defect (VSD), with contrast entering from the left ventricle to a relatively normal sized right ventricle (RV); despite B) significant pulmonary artery dilatation.**

• CT can be helpful in the assessment of coronary arteries and for surgical planning (Figure 7), as it allows assessment of the proximity of the VSD to the surrounding valves and the atrioventricular conduction axis.

![](_page_7_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Figure 7. ECG-gated computed tomography angiography demonstrating a membranous ventricular septal defect (arrow): A) pre-operatively; and B) following implantation of a closure device.**

• A VSD is sometimes identified incidentally on CT.

#### 6 **What are the principles of assessing an atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) with radiological imaging?**

- Chest radiography usually shows cardiomegaly, as well as large proximal and small peripheral pulmonary arteries (peripheral pruning). Pulmonary venous markings are more prominent in patients with significant common AV valve regurgitation.
- CT may provide further anatomical information (Figure 8), especially when echocardiography is inconclusive. It is also helpful in assessing outflow tract obstruction and defining coexisting anomalies, such as coarctation.
- In unbalanced AVSD and heterotaxy syndrome, CT scanning can be useful in defining associated anomalies.
- Similar to CT, MRI may also allow further anatomical evaluation and can be used to follow up operated patients, as it is helpful in the quantification of mitral regurgitation, LV size and function, and haemodynamic evaluation of any residual shunt.

![](_page_8_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 8. ECG-gated computed tomography axial image demonstrating a complete atrioventricular septal defect, associated with significant right ventricular enlargement and Eisenmenger syndrome.**

#### 7 **What are the principles of assessing tetralogy of Fallot with radiological imaging?**

- CT is a fast and convenient method in both the paediatric and adult populations for assessing the morphology of the right ventricular outflow tract, pulmonary arteries and aorta (Figure 9).
- Other coexisting anomalies, such as an ASD, patent ductus arteriosus and aortopulmonary collaterals, can also be detected (Figure 10).
- CT is particularly useful in planning for re-do surgery, to evaluate the patency of coronary arteries, and to note the relation of the heart and large vessels to the sternum (Figure 11).
- MRI is used to delineate anatomy, function and haemodynamic status. It can be used in neonates with tetralogy of Fallot where there is a facility for adequate sedation, but it is particularly helpful in the follow-up of older children and adults with total correction of tetralogy of Fallot. CMR allows assessment of ventricular size and function, and quantification of pulmonary regurgitation. CMR and flow velocity mapping can also detect and quantify any residual VSD, if present. Phase contrast and cine MRI are the preferred modalities to quantify

**Figure 9. Computed tomography images of a patient with tetralogy of Fallot demonstrating: A) and B) a thickened pulmonary valve; and C) hypoplastic but confluent main pulmonary artery, subaortic ventricular septal defect and an overriding aorta.**

**Figure 10. Computed tomography in a patient with tetralogy of Fallot demonstrating: A) a dilated aortic root and right-sided aortic arch; B) subaortic ventricular septal defect; C) severely stenotic proximal left pulmonary artery; D) prominent major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCA) from the descending aorta to the left lung on volume-rendered images; and E) a calcified but patent right ventricular outflow tract.**

**Figure 11. ECG-gated computed tomography angiography in a patient with a failing pulmonary valve bioprosthesis demonstrating the close relationship of the left coronary artery (LCA) to the pulmonary artery and bioprosthesis on: A) double oblique multiplanar projection; and B) volumerendered image; and C) the close proximity of the dilated right ventricle to the sternal manubrium.**

pulmonary regurgitation and RV ejection fraction in order to determine the optimal timing for pulmonary valve replacement. In the presence of significant pulmonary regurgitation, progressive RV enlargement or reduced ventricular function detected by serial CMR are among the indications for pulmonary valve replacement.

• Delayed contrast enhancement imaging can identify ventricular scarring and fibrosis at the right ventricular surgical site or LV myocardium, which has been shown to have an adverse effect in prognosis.

#### 8 **What are the principles of assessing double-outlet right ventricle with radiological imaging?**

• In double-outlet right ventricle (DORV), MRI provides complementary and important information on intracardiac anatomy, right and left ventricular function, the feasibility of intracardiac repair, and the morphology of the pulmonary arteries and aortic arch (Figure 12).

![](_page_12_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Figure 12. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging T2-weighted sequence demonstrating: A) a grossly enlarged right atrium with stagnation of flow; and B) mid-wall fibrosis of the septum and left ventricular apex in late gadolinium sequences.**

- CT can also determine the relationship of the great arteries to the RV, assess the location of the ventricular septal defect, and the presence and extent of obstruction of the pulmonary and aortic outflow tracts (Figure 13).
- CT and MRI can be used in ruling out extracardiac associated anomalies, including anomalous venous return, aortic coarctation, interrupted aortic arch and persistent ductus arteriosus. 3D

![](_page_13_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 13. Computed tomography images in a patient with doubleoutlet right ventricle, tricuspid atresia and transposition of the great arteries demonstrating: A) the side-by-side great arteries, a large bulboventricular ventricular septal defect (connecting a small right ventricle to the left ventricle); B) outflow from the right ventricle to the anteriorly located aorta and kinking of the aortic isthmus (with no anatomical obstruction); C) a grossly enlarged right atrium with a large filling defect (consistent with thrombus) on the venous phase image; and D) a patent right coronary artery in close proximity to the sternum on curved multiplanar reconstruction.**

- multiplanar reconstruction allows better demonstration of the anatomy which can help improve surgical planning.
- CT is also useful in detecting coronary artery anomalies, including anomalous origin of the right coronary artery (RCA) from the left main coronary artery (LMCA), duplication of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), anomalous origin of the LAD or left circumflex artery from the RCA, and a single right or left coronary artery.
- Whilst most post-interventional imaging is carried out by echocardiography, MRI and CT can offer valuable information when more precise assessment of RV function or evaluation of residual outflow or conduit obstruction are needed.

#### 9 **What are the principles of assessing transposition of the great arteries with radiological imaging?**

- Chest radiograph often shows a narrow mediastinal shadow owing to the parallel relationship of the great arteries (Figure 14). The cardiothoracic ratio is normal in a patient without ventricular dilation, and pulmonary vascular markings are normal in the absence of pulmonary hypertension.
- Following an atrial switch procedure, MRI allows quantitative assessment of right and left ventricular systolic function, and serial measurements of systemic right ventricular function.

![](_page_14_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Figure 14. Chest radiograph in a patient with transposition of the great arteries demonstrating a narrow upper mediastinum, due to the central configuration of the aorta and pulmonary artery.**

- In addition, the baffle anatomy can be assessed and any shunt across a baffle leak can be quantified.
- As many of these patients have a pacemaker, CT is sometimes preferred over MRI, where postoperative anatomy, baffle obstruction and leaks, and vena cava obstruction can be evaluated efficiently (Figure 15).

![](_page_15_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 15. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans of an adult patient with transposition of the great arteries who had undergone a Mustard procedure in infancy, demonstrating a widely patent stent in the superior vena cava baffle (arrow) on: A) early; and B) late phase images; and C) occluded and partially calcified inferior vena cava baffle (arrow).**

• Following a Rastelli operation, up to 25% of these patients have evidence of left ventricular dysfunction at late follow-up. Right ventricular dysfunction is also common, as is conduit dysfunction subsequent to the pressure and/or volume overload. MRI is useful in serial quantitative assessment of right and left ventricular systolic function and conduit function. CT can show the conduit patency, calcification, stenosis and LVOT obstruction and branch pulmonary artery stenosis in these patients (Figure 16).

![](_page_16_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Figure 16. ECG-gated computed tomography angiography in a patient with transposition of the great arteries, who had previously undergone a Rastelli procedure, with: A) the coronal image demonstrating a diffusely calcified pulmonary conduit (arrow) with a small low attenuation vegetation attached to the bioprosthetic pulmonary valve; B) axial; and C) sagittal images demonstrating the close proximity of the conduit to the sternal wires.**

- Following an arterial switch operation with Lecompte procedure, surgical complications include pulmonary outflow obstruction and branch pulmonary artery stenosis, neo-aortic root dilatation and valve regurgitation, and coronary artery stenosis.
- In these patients, other than quantifying ventricular volumes, MRI is useful in assessing valve function, such as the severity of aortic regurgitation. The anatomy of the branch pulmonary arteries and coronary arteries can be defined by MRI, as well as evaluating the myocardial perfusion and viability (Figure 17).

**Figure 17. Magnetic resonance angiography demonstrating the pulmonary arteries straddling the aorta following an arterial switch procedure and Lecompte manoeuvre, with narrowing of the left pulmonary artery (arrow) due to compression from the ascending aorta and a mildly dilated sinus of Valsalva (arrowhead) on: A) axial b-SSFP; and B) volumerendered images.**

- CT is useful in further anatomical delineation, exclusion of branch pulmonary artery stenosis and investigation for coronary artery stenosis.
- 10 **What are the principles of assessing congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries with radiological imaging?**
- Chest radiograph in patients with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA) may demonstrate dextrocardia or mesocardia.
- MRI is a useful modality in patients with ccTGA and following surgery for assessment of:

- a) anatomy and ventricular function;
- b) myocardial ischaemia or scarring;
- c) RV size and function;
- d) tricuspid regurgitation severity.
- Cardiac CT allows excellent anatomical assessment of the cardiac chambers, great vessels and coronary arteries, as well as determination of cardiac function (Figure 18).

PC = pulmonary conduit.**

#### 11 **What are the principles of assessing <sup>a</sup> cavopulmonary circulation with radiological imaging?**

- Prior to surgery, radiological imaging is used for Fontan planning with:
  - a) CT which provides an anatomical assessment, especially looking at branch pulmonary artery stenosis and pulmonary venous return (Figure 19);
  - b) MRI which can be used to assess ventricular function, valvular regurgitation and pulmonary venous return. In the presence of a collateral circulation, quantifying collateral flow is possible by velocity mapping.
- Following surgery, radiological imaging is useful in determining the haemodynamic status of the Fontan circulation and the detection of complications, including:
  - a) CT which is used to detect cavopulmonary connection stenosis and thrombosis, pulmonary vein compression by a dilated right atrium, and pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae;
  - b) MRI which is excellent in assessing ventricular function, evaluating Fontan connections and early detection of pulmonary artery stenosis. Detecting and quantifying flow through the patch or a baffle leak, systemic vein to pulmonary vein collaterals, pulmonary arteriovenous malformations and fenestrations is also possible. It can also assess thrombosis on early gadolinium enhancement studies, fibrosis on late gadolinium enhancement studies and guide interventions, such as electrophysiology intervention for arrhythmia.
- In patients following post-aortic arch and coarctation repair, MRI and CT can be incorporated in the follow-up, with MRI or stress echocardiography used to identify myocardial ischaemia, secondary to poor perfusion when the coronary arteries arise from a diminutive aorta.

A closure device was later inserted in the azygos connection to the left pulmonary artery (arrow) that only achieves partial closure (red arrow); C) coronal image demonstrating persistent hepatic vein drainage to the right atrium causing mixing of a small amount of desaturated blood with oxygenated blood.**

#### 12 **What are the principles of assessing anomalous pulmonary venous drainage with radiological imaging?**

- Unless the anomalous pulmonary vein drains close to the cavo-atrial connection, the diagnosis of assessing anomalous pulmonary venous drainage by echocardiography can be difficult.
- Echocardiography is often used to assess cardiac function and identify any intracardiac shunts, with CT and MRI representing the best modalities to diagnose assessing anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (Figures 20 and 21).

![](_page_21_Picture_5.jpeg)

• Chest radiographical features of assessing anomalous pulmonary venous drainage may include a Scimitar sign or evidence of pulmonary artery dilatation and cardiomegaly.

#### 13 **What are the principles of assessing coarctation of the aorta and arch hypoplasia with radiological imaging?**

- In patients with coarctation of the aorta, imaging is used to define the coarctation lesion and also to identify any other coexisting cardiovascular abnormalities, including bicuspid aortic valve (up to 85%), ventricular septal defects, mitral valve abnormalities, intracranial aneurysms (Berry aneurysm of the circle of Willis in 3- 5%).
- Chest radiograph may demonstrate rib notching (Roesler sign), which is caused by dilated intercostal collateral vessels bypassing the coarctation and eroding the inferior margins of the ribs (Figure 22). In addition, a 'figure of 3' sign can be seen, which is formed by pre- and post-stenotic dilatation of the coarcted aorta.
- Although echocardiography is the modality of choice for diagnosis and follow-up, it has an innate limitation for assessing the thoracic aorta and complications in this region. Transoesophageal echocardiography has a better diagnostic field in detailed examination of the aorta but it is semi-invasive.

![](_page_23_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Figure 22. A) Chest radiograph and B) magnified inset of a patient with coarctation of the aorta demonstrating subcostal bone erosion (rib notching) secondary to intercostal artery dilatation.**

• MRI can assess the severity of the coarctation, relationship of the vessel to the neighbouring structures, presence of associated anomalies, shunt quantitation and presence of collateral vessels, which is important for surgical planning (Figure 23).

![](_page_24_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Figure 23. Volume-rendered contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography demonstrating: A) a tight coarctation at the junction of the distal arch and descending aorta (arrow); and B) dilated internal mammary and intercostal arteries bridging the stenotic aorta on the maximum intensity projection (MIP) reconstruction.**

- MRI is the preferred modality due to the lack of radiation in these often young patients and can detect complications, such as recoarctation or aneurysm formation.
- CT angiography is preferred in patients with a stented coarctation due to the metallic artefacts that prevent accurate assessment of the stent by MRI. CT may also be used in children who cannot tolerate MRI.
- CT can define the site and morphology of the coarctation, presence of any arch hypoplasia, collateral circulation or associated anomalies.
- CT does not, however, provide functional data, such as the gradient across the coarctation.
- In the post-intervention patient, CT allows detection of any residual stenosis or recoarctation and collateral vessel formation (Figure 24). It is also useful in the diagnosis of post-stenting complications, such

as aortic dissection, leaks, in-stent thrombus, stent migration and stent fracture. CT is the preferred modality to evaluate the coronary arteries in these patients.

Asc Ao = ascending aorta; Desc Ao = descending aorta.**

#### 14 **What are the principles of assessing interrupted aortic arch with radiological imaging?**

- Both CT and MRI can be employed to differentiate between interrupted aortic arch with severe coarctation from aortic arch hypoplasia that may not be possible by echocardiography.
- CTA and CMR can delineate the anatomical features of the different subtypes of interrupted aortic arch and can also be used in assessing associated anomalies, such as VSD, subaortic stenosis and other complex lesions.

• Multiplanar and volume-rendering reconstruction from CT and/or MRI demonstrates the anatomical configurations and relationships to other structures that can facilitate surgical planning. Moreover, CT and MRI have an important role in postoperative follow-up.

#### 15 **What are the principles of assessing hypoplastic left heart syndrome with radiological imaging?**

- Ultrasound can detect hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) during prenatal evaluation, especially after week 22 of the pregnancy, when the ventricular size difference becomes more apparent. In the postnatal period, echocardiography can confirm the diagnosis.
- CMR can be used in the decision making after the initial Norwood procedure to determine whether the patient is suitable for a Glenn and subsequent Fontan procedure. CMR can precisely delineate the ventricular size and function, pulmonary arteries and neo-aorta.
- CT can be performed before and after the first step of the Norwood procedure to detect any associated anomalies, sizing of neo-aorta, biventricular size and pulmonary arteries.

#### 16 **What is the role of radiological imaging in the assessment of the proximal aortic pathology?**

- Three-dimensional imaging should be incorporated along with 2D echocardiography in the detection and monitoring of the aortic root and ascending aorta in connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos and Loeys-Dietz syndrome, or anomalies, such as bicuspid aortic valve with concomitant aortic root dilatation.
- CTA is the most precise technique for the measurement of aortic diameter.
- MRI is the preferred method in follow-up, especially in the young population. Non-contrast 3D SSFP can be used to measure the aortic root by incorporating multiplanar reconstruction. SSFP cine images of the aorta can also be used for measurement. Adding CMR cine images and flow velocity mapping allows the assessment of concomitant valve disease, such as mitral valve prolapse in Marfan syndrome, and aortic valve regurgitation in patients with bicuspid aortic valve.

#### 17 **What are the principles of assessing Ebstein's anomaly with radiological imaging?**

- Chest radiography in a severe form of Ebstein's valve may demonstrate cardiomegaly, a narrow aortic pedicle and decreased pulmonary vascular markings.
- Both CT and MRI can be used to demonstrate the characteristic findings in Ebstein's anomaly, including the apical displacement of the septal or posterior tricuspid valve leaflet, atrialised right ventricle, and severe right atrial enlargement (Figure 25). They also delineate associated anomalies such as ASD, pulmonary valve stenosis, subaortic stenosis or aortic coarctation.

![](_page_27_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Figure 25. Radiological imaging of Ebstein's anomaly characterised by apical displacement of the septal tricuspid valve leaflet (arrow), atrialised right ventricular (RV) and severe right atrial (RA) enlargement on: A) axial computed tomography; and B) and C) axial steady-state free precession magnetic resonance imaging; D) sail-like anterior tricuspid leaflet in a fourchamber steady-state free precession magnetic resonance image.**

- MRI is very useful in the follow-up of patients with Ebstein's anomaly, as it provides accurate quantitative measurements of the right ventricular size and function, and tricuspid regurgitation severity.
- MRI also enables detection of any shunt and its haemodynamic significance by quantifying the Qp:Qs ratio. In late gadolinium enhancement images, fibrotic changes in the atrialised ventricle can also be identified. CMR is particularly useful in assessing left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) cardiomyopathy that has been reported and associated with Ebstein anomaly.
- CMR can also be used in the postoperative surveillance of RV function and repaired (cone) or replaced tricuspid valve.
- CT can be helpful in patients with poor echocardiographical acoustic windows for visualising the RV and when MRI is challenging because of the lack of capability to hold breath. RV function can be quantified on CT with retrospective gating but at the cost of increased radiation.

### 18 **What are the principles of imaging for planning and follow-up of transcatheter procedures?**

- Echocardiography and CT are used to identify a patient's suitability and feasibility for transcatheter cardiovascular procedures (Figure 26).
- Application of non-invasive imaging has significantly improved procedure safety, such as by identification of the correct device size and by avoiding injury to adjacent structures.
- CT is used to evaluate the adequacy and patency of arterial and venous access, and to identify related complications.
- Echocardiography, CT and positron emission tomography (PET) are used to identify device infection and its source.

![](_page_29_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 26. Computed tomography (CT) images used to plan transcatheter valve implantation for a patient with tetralogy of Fallot and significant pulmonary homograft valve regurgitation. CT can help to choose the appropriate size and type of device, measure the length and diameter of the homograft, location of the homograft in relation to the coronary arteries and to map venous access, especially when venous stenosis or thrombosis is suspected.**

#### 19 **What are the principles of assessing vascular slings and rings with radiological imaging?**

• Since patients with vascular slings and rings often present with respiratory symptoms, chest radiograph may be the initial imaging step, with findings such as tracheal narrowing or unilateral aeration.

- Upper GI fluoroscopy in a patient with dysphasia may demonstrate indentation of the oesophagus in the lateral view.
- CTA and MRA can both demonstrate the vascular structure in precise relation to extra-vascular anatomy (Figure 27). Gated CTA or CMR can delineate any intracardiac-associated anomalies (Figure 28).

#### 20 **What are the principles of assessing an aortopulmonary connection with radiological imaging?**

• CT scanning can be used to delineate the anatomical features of aortopulmonary window with an abnormal connection between the aorta and the pulmonary trunk, as well as associated anomalies related to pulmonary hypertension (Figure 29).

![](_page_31_Figure_4.jpeg)
