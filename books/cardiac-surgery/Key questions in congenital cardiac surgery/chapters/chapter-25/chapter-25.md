## Double-outlet right ventricle

**Adrian Crucean, Natasha E. Khan**

## 1 **What is the definition of double-outlet right ventricle?**

- Double-outlet right ventricle (DORV) is a type of ventriculo-arterial connection in which both great arteries arise entirely or predominantly from the morphological right ventricle (RV).
- More than 50% of the cross-sectional area of the pulmonary valve and more than 50% of the cross-sectional area of the aortic valve must be supported by the RV (the '50% rule'). The exact percentage has been debated in the past and the key word in the definition is 'predominantly' (Figure 1).

#### 2 **Is double-outlet right ventricle <sup>a</sup> single congenital phenotypical malformation?**

- DORV does not represent a specific phenotype but comprises hearts with very heterogeneous cardiac and extracardiac anatomy simply united by one variety of ventriculo-arterial connection.
- It can exist with other forms of atrial arrangements, atrioventricular connections and arterial relationships.
- It cannot exist with another form of ventriculo-arterial connection.
- The great arteries may be arranged normally relative to each other, or they may be 'malposed'.

#### 3 **Is double-outlet right ventricle an abnormality of the position of the great arteries or an abnormality of the outlet septum?**

- Many have tried to define DORV with one main characteristic. As a result, several definitions are currently found in the literature, including:
  - a) fibrous discontinuity between the mitral and aortic valves;
  - b) malposition of the great arteries;
  - c) the presence of bilateral infundibula;
  - d) the position of the outlet septum (OS) relative to the great arteries.
- All the above features are variable in themselves and hence, it is better to use a single objective criterion for diagnosis, i.e. the ventriculo-arterial connections.

#### 4 **Describe the embryological development of doubleoutlet right ventricle**

- There is a normal early phase during any human embryo heart when both outflow tracts are entirely supported by the developing RV with the embryonic interventricular communication being the only outlet of the developing left ventricle (LV) into the RV.
- Further remodelling of this interventricular communication and a complex transfer process of translocation and rotation of the septated aortic root towards the LV ensures the normal heart develops its separate connections.
- If the early developmental phase persists, then the definitive RV will retain its connection with both arterial outlets even after their septation.
- This explains why DORV is far more frequent than the double-outlet left ventricle. There is good evidence for this ontogenetic developmental theory; however, it is not yet clear whether DORV

reflects a simple arrested development phase or whether there are active factors involved in the various phenotypes.

#### 5 **Which congenital anomalies are associated with double-outlet right ventricle?**

#### • Common:

- a) RV outflow tract obstruction at valvular or subvalvular level is the most frequent (rarely seen in Taussig-Bing anomaly), ranging from pulmonary stenosis to pulmonary atresia;
- b) atrial septal defect (ASD);
- c) coarctation of the aorta and hypoplastic aortic arch or even arch interruption/atresia;
- d) valvular or subvalvular LV outflow tract obstruction;
- e) atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), usually 'Type C' Rastelli;
- f) hypoplasia of the LV.

#### • Rare:

- a) discordant atrioventricular connections;
- b) atrioventricular valve malformations, such as straddling, hypoplasia or stenosis (for example, mitral straddling in Taussig-Bing anomaly);
- c) RV hypoplasia;
- d) mitral stenosis;
- e) twisted atrioventricular connections;
- f) complex anomalies and combinations of the above, including right atrial isomerism, total anomalous pulmonary venous connections, unbalanced common atrioventricular junction, RV obstruction, pulmonary atresia, aortic arch obstruction;
- g) comorbidities associated with isomerism (gut malrotation, asplenia or polysplenia, renal anomalies).

### 6 **What is the Taussig-Bing anomaly?**

- Helen Taussig and Richard Bing first described a case of DORV in 1949 as "DORV with the aorta arising almost entirely from the RV and an overriding pulmonary trunk, side-by-side great arteries, bilateral conuses of almost equal height, and a large subpulmonary VSD".
- Currently, the definition extends to include a spectrum of hearts with subpulmonary VSD via a malaligned outlet septum into the RV. Based on the degree of pulmonary trunk overriding, it ranges from DORV to discordant ventriculo-arterial connections (transposition of the great arteries [TGA]).

- Any type of infundibulum and great artery arrangements are included.
- Frequently, there are associated anomalies, including subaortic obstruction, aortic arch hypoplasia, obstruction or coarctation, mitral valve cleft and/or straddling, and anomalies of the coronary arteries.
- These hearts almost always require an arterial switch operation for their repair.
- 7 **What is the anatomical classification of double-outlet right ventricle?**
- Based on the VSD phenotype and topography, the following types of DORV exist:
  - a) DORV with subaortic VSD where the RV aspect of the VSD lies beneath the aortic valve (Figures 2 and 3);

The aortic and pulmonary leaflets are separated from the tricuspid valve.

- b) DORV with subpulmonary VSD (Taussig-Bing anomaly) where the RV aspect of the VSD lies beneath the pulmonary valve (Figure 4);
- c) DORV with doubly-committed VSD (rare) where there is a fibrous continuity between the pulmonary and aortic leaflets at the roof of the VSD. This entity, however, should more appropriately be named juxta-arterial VSD; (All the above VSDs are outlet defects. Based on their border morphology, the first two categories can be perimembranous or muscular. The third category can sometimes extend to the

#### 8 **What are the key anatomical modifiers of doubleoutlet right ventricle?**

- The most important morphological features of DORV that influence the surgical treatment include:
  - a) anatomy of the interventricular communication;
  - b) relationship of the great arteries;
  - c) location of the conduction tissue.
- An interventricular communication is present in the great majority of cases and is a better term than the simple geometric named VSD. These communications are complex 3D multiplane channels with a right and left ventricular entrance to the VSD channel.
- In the normal heart, when looking at the RV side of the septum, the outlet septum is in the same plane as the rest of the septal structures. The outlet septum is normally embedded between the cranial and

caudal limbs of the septomarginal trabeculation (SMT, septal band) and in continuity with the ventriculo-infundibular fold (VIF) of the inner heart curvature (IHC). The latter two structures take part in forming the muscular infundibulum (conus) below the pulmonary valve. There is no complete infundibulum below the aortic valve because of the fibrous aorto-mitral curtain.

- In the normal heart, the outlet septum separates the subaortic and subpulmonary outlets. The infundibulum separates the leaflets of the atrioventricular and arterial valves. The septomarginal trabeculation is a relatively constant muscle bundle on the RV side of the septum that runs from the outlet to the RV apex.
- In contrast, in DORV, the defect involves displacement of the outlet septum, which becomes an intracavitary RV structure. Therefore, the continuity of the outlet septum with the rest of the RV septal plane is lost. The displacement of the outlet septum is accompanied by changes in the position of the great arteries (Figure 5).

**lp** — safe to resect if well formed. In doubly-committed subarterial VSD it can be absent or a fibrous remnant.

**sfc** — safe to partially resect if well formed. Aggressive resection will penetrate the ventricular wall into the pericardial space.

**spa** opens between the limbs of SMT. Usually, if the OS is attached to the cephalad limb then the VSD is subaortic. If attached to the caudal limb, the VSD is subpulmonary.

Cephalad or anterior limb of the **pjq**. Safe to resect but the perforator artery may be embedded near the anterior interventricular groove.

Caudal or posterior limb of the **pjq** — if it is short, then it allows for arterial to tricuspid continuity and the **ÅçåÇìÅíáçå ~ñáë** is superficial and at risk during VSD closure. If well developed, then it fuses to the VIF and the conduction axis will be away from the posteroinferior muscular rim.

- In the normal heart, each great artery arises 100% from its corresponding ventricle. When a VSD is present, as in DORV, the arterial tracts may arise from the non-corresponding ventricle to various degrees. There is a morphological continuum in which the great arteries change their normal one-to-one connection with their corresponding ventricles towards a setting where a variable part of the circumference of each of the great arteries becomes supported by the RV.
- DORV comprises hearts at the end of this spectrum in which the majority of the great artery roots are supported by the RV.
- In terms of relationships of the great arteries, the following should be remembered:
  - a) normal relations (with the aorta posterior and to the right of the pulmonary trunk) are usually found with subaortic or doublycommitted VSD;
  - b) side-by-side great arteries do not predict the location of the VSD;
  - c) anterior aorta is frequent with a subpulmonary VSD but this arrangement is not 'transposition'; an anterior and left-sided aorta is usually found in subaortic VSD. The term 'malposed great arteries' may be used in DORV if followed by their precise description.
- The conduction tissue usually runs in the posteroinferior border of the VSD. If the defect is muscular, the conduction bundle will not be vulnerable in the posteroinferior position. If VSD enlargement is necessary, the position of the conduction tissue must be considered.
- Pre-operative imaging or intra-operative inspection will allow a decision to be made whether to close the VSD on its RV or LV entrance. In the first situation, the patient has either a VSD type or TOF type of DORV. In the latter situation, a Taussig-Bing type of DORV is present and an arterial switch is needed.
- 9 **What are the common physiological consequences of double-outlet right ventricle?**
- The physiology depends largely on the position and anatomy of the VSD (Figure 6). The VSD may be committed or non-committed.
- Committed VSD where flow across the VSD is directed predominantly into a particular outflow tract. This preferentially

**Figure 6.

directed flow is often called 'streaming'. These are subcategorised as:

- a) subaortic VSD where LV blood flow across the VSD is directed into the aorta, hence oxygenated blood flows correctly into the systemic circulation;
- b) subpulmonary VSD where LV blood flow across the VSD is directed into the pulmonary artery, hence oxygenated blood flows back to the pulmonary circulation, while relatively desaturated blood flows into the aorta and systemic circulation;
- c) doubly-committed juxta-arterial VSD where the flow across the VSD is directed into both the aorta and pulmonary artery.
- Non-committed VSD where the blood flow through the VSD is not directed towards either of the outflows of the heart. It is remote from both the pulmonary and aortic valves, usually being an inlet or apical VSD. The flow across this VSD is directed into the RV cavity rather than into an outflow tract and then into a great artery. This is an uncommon type of DORV.
- From the above description, the physiology may be elucidated (Figure 7):
  - a) DORV with subaortic VSD. Although both great arteries arise from the RV, LV blood passes across the VSD into the aorta. The pulmonary artery arises entirely from the RV. The RV pressure is equal to the LV pressure due to the VSD, and the lower vascular resistance in the pulmonary vascular bed leads to pulmonary over-circulation. Thus, if DORV with subaortic VSD exists without pulmonary stenosis, it behaves like a VSD, whereas in the presence of pulmonary stenosis, it behaves like tetralogy of Fallot. In the latter case, the patient may be well balanced, with the pulmonary stenosis protecting the pulmonary vasculature from over-circulation. If the pulmonary stenosis is severe, or if there is pulmonary atresia, the patient will be cyanotic due to right-to-left shunting. If pulmonary stenosis is absent or mild, the patient will suffer from pulmonary over-circulation. In the case of pulmonary atresia, the only outlet from the heart is into the aorta, and an alternative source of pulmonary blood flow, such as a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), will have to be present for survival;
  - b) DORV with subpulmonary VSD. LV blood flows across the VSD into the pulmonary artery. The aorta arises entirely from

**791 Figure 7. Physiological behaviour based on the position of the ventricular septal defect (VSD). In the VSD-type, there is a net left-to-right shunt at ventricular level, causing the main pulmonary arterial saturation to be near systemic. In tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)-type, right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction can drive bidirectional or right-to-left shunting at ventricular level, with overall cyanosis. In transposition of the great arteries (TGA)-type (with subpulmonary VSD), streaming of blood mimics the physiology of TGA.**

the RV. This is similar to the physiology in TGA, with LV blood flowing into the pulmonary artery, and RV or mixed blood flowing into the aorta. As above, if there is no mechanical obstruction to blood flow into the pulmonary artery, there will be pulmonary over-circulation. As RV blood flows into the aorta, however, these babies are cyanotic. The degree of cyanosis will depend on the efficiency of 'mixing', which may happen through an ASD, VSD, or even across a PDA.

• The above two arrangements show the spectrum of DORV, from Fallot-type (subaortic VSD) to transposition-type (subpulmonary VSD) of physiology. In their simplest forms, these lesions are treated according to their physiology, with Fallot-type by closure of the VSD and augmentation of the RVOT, and transposition-type by arterial switch operation.

• In the context of DORV, 'committability' refers to the flow pattern into the great arteries. It is an evolving term depending on surgical abilities, whereas 'remoteness' is an anatomical term. They are not totally interchangeable.

#### 10 **What is the epidemiology and natural history of patients with double-outlet right ventricle?**

- DORV is rare and detected in approximately 0.5-1.5% of postnatal congenital heart disease.
- The natural history will differ with the associated anatomy and pathophysiology of this heterogeneous group, mirroring the evolution of untreated VSD, TOF, arch obstruction or other associated conditions.

#### 11 **Describe the presentation of <sup>a</sup> patient with doubleoutlet right ventricle**

- Patients usually present in the neonatal period with:
  - a) an antenatal diagnosis;
  - b) obvious extracardiac anomalies;
  - c) circulatory collapse caused by aortic arch hypoplasia/interruption;
  - d) cyanosis caused by restricted pulmonary blood flow or poor mixing;
  - e) heart failure caused by pulmonary over-circulation.

#### 12 **What are the chest radiographical features of doubleoutlet right ventricle?**

- Cardiomegaly and plethoric lungs in VSD-type DORV.
- Mild or no cardiomegaly and reduced pulmonary vascular markings in TOF-type DORV.

#### 13 **What are the echocardiographic features of doubleoutlet right ventricle?**

• Echocardiography is the most important diagnostic tool because it provides a comprehensive analysis of the morphological and physiological features.

- The echocardiographic approach should address the diagnosis with a systematic sequential segmental analysis of the heart as a whole, including:
  - a) atrial morphology and systemic/pulmonary venous return which is particularly important in isomeric hearts;
  - b) atrioventricular valves where there may be a common atrioventricular valve, absent connections or straddling (Figure 8);

• It is the short, not the long, axis of the ventricular mass that must be used in any imaging method to assign the extent of overriding of the arterial root circumference.

#### 14 **What is the role of cross-sectional imaging in doubleoutlet right ventricle?**

- Cardiac catheterisation is rarely required but can be used to characterise the systemic and pulmonary venous return, coronary anatomy, pressure gradients, or to measure the pulmonary vascular resistance and relative systemic and pulmonary blood flows.
- Computed tomography (CT) is indicated for the evaluation of intracardiac anatomy (Figures 13 and 14) and extracardiac vascular anatomy, including arch and pulmonary arteries, coronary anatomy (Figure 15), and suitability of VSD closure.
- Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used in a few selected patients to measure the pulmonary vascular resistance, and relative systemic and pulmonary blood flows.

• They can also form the base for 3D printing models in order to guide the surgical therapy, in particular when complex septation on the ventricles is suspected or complex closure of the VSD is to be undertaken, such as cases of a restrictive VSD needing enlargement (Figure 16), non-committed and/or multiple defects (Figure 17).

#### 15 **Describe the early interventions for neonates with double-outlet right ventricle**

- Most babies with DORV present early, with the majority having had an antenatal diagnosis.
- Early complete repair is often not indicated due to the DORV morphology, or due to patient comorbidities.
- In these patients, an early intervention is required to create a 'balanced' circulation with optimal pulmonary blood flow and systemic blood flow to achieve adequate oxygen delivery for the metabolic needs of the patient.
- This can be achieved by reducing or augmenting pulmonary blood flow.
- It is usually clear from imaging at the neonatal stage if a twoventricle circulation is not possible. If the child is clearly going down the path of functionally univentricular palliation, an assessment must be made of the child's comorbidities to decide whether this will be possible, such as the severe airway abnormalities associated with CHARGE syndrome may preclude a successful functionally single-ventricle circulation.
- The aim of interventions in neonates who will require functionally univentricular palliation is to secure the systemic outflow while protecting the pulmonary vascular bed as far as possible. These interventions or palliations will be designed to last until the child is months old, when the first of the two-stage total cavopulmonary connections (TCPC) can be undertaken.

#### 16 **What are the principles of surgery to restrict pulmonary blood flow?**

- In patients where there is no pulmonary stenosis, there may be 'over-circulation' into the pulmonary vascular bed across the VSD.
- These patients will have increasing heart failure as the pulmonary vascular resistance falls in the first weeks after birth, leading to increasing Qp:Qs.
- To protect the pulmonary vascular bed, and to reduce the symptoms of over-circulation (tachypnoea, failure to thrive, greater vulnerability to respiratory infections), pulmonary blood flow must be restricted.
- This is most commonly achieved by applying a pulmonary artery band (using umbilical tape, Gore-Tex® suture/band or a silicone

- sheet) to the main pulmonary artery, thereby mechanically reducing the diameter and cross-sectional area of the pulmonary outflow.
- Pulmonary artery banding is usually performed via a median sternotomy but if a thoracotomy is being performed for another intervention, such as coarctation or arch repair, the band may be sited through this incision, although this is rare in DORV.
- The circumference of the band is determined using the formula 18- 21mm + patient's weight (Trusler's law).
- This starting circumference depends on the underlying pathology. For example, if preparing for a functionally single-ventricle circulation, the band may be tighter for optimal pulmonary vascular protection. If preparing for a complete repair in the future where patient size is optimally larger, the band may initially be looser to allow growth of the child.
- Echocardiography is used to monitor band tightness, with the peak velocity across the band of 3-4m/s and direct measurement of distal pulmonary artery pressure to achieve less than 50% the systemic pressure.
- The band tightness varies with changing pulmonary vascular resistance, such as an awake, distressed child has a significantly different pulmonary vascular pressure than a paralysed, sedated child. The conditions in the operating theatre when the band is applied are very different than those of the child when awake and extubated, feeding or crying, and the band may have to be adjusted in a minority of cases.

#### 17 **What are the principles of surgery to enhance pulmonary blood flow?**

- In children born with DORV and tight pulmonary stenosis, there may be severe hypoxia due to excessive right-to-left shunting and inadequate pulmonary blood flow.
- Pulmonary outflow tract obstruction is a common feature of DORV with subaortic VSD, and may lead to a nicely balanced circulation, allowing delay in the need for complete repair until the neonate is older and bigger.
- Where there is significant pulmonary outflow obstruction, or pulmonary atresia, however, a secure source of blood flow to the lungs must be established early.

- The choice is dependent on the underlying anatomy and condition of the patient, and includes a:
  - a) RV to pulmonary artery shunt where a 5-6mm Gore-Tex® tube is anastomosed from the RV to the main pulmonary trunk or one of the branch pulmonary arteries. It may be combined with augmentation of the branch pulmonary arteries, as required, and is performed through a median sternotomy, with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass and ischaemic arrest of the heart. This creates a more stable circulation than the traditional modified systemic to pulmonary shunt but may not be technically feasible in all patients;
  - b) modified Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt where a 3-4mm Gore-Tex® tube is anastomosed from the brachiocephalic or subclavian artery to a branch pulmonary artery. Although traditionally performed through a thoracotomy, it is now more commonly performed through a median sternotomy to allow the use of cardiopulmonary bypass in unstable, small neonates. An inherently unstable circulation is created with diastolic run-off into the shunt potentially jeopardising the coronary circulation, hence the high surgical mortality of 5- 10% from this procedure;
  - c) ductus arteriosus stent which is undertaken in the catheter laboratory using a coronary artery stent that is placed in the ductus arteriosus to maintain patency and provide stable blood flow to the pulmonary arteries. This creates a similar circulation to a modified BT shunt but is not associated with the same mortality. This intervention may not be technically feasible in all patients, depending on ductal and pulmonary artery anatomy;
  - d) RV outflow tract stent which is more commonly used in tetralogy of Fallot, where the outflow tract anatomy is more favourable but in some cases may be appropriate in DORV. A stent is placed in the outflow tract to maintain patency of the muscular infundibulum (Figure 18) and may cross the pulmonary valve, if necessary. This stent may be further dilated at a later stage to allow further growth of the child before complete repair. When patient selection is optimal, this intervention has excellent results.

- 18 **What are the principles of surgery for double-outlet right ventricle with a subaortic or doubly-committed ventricular septal defect?**
- Repair of these lesions consists of placing a baffle around the VSD in such a way as to separate the ventricular outflow tracts (Figure 19).
- The geometric VSD is not closed, as the VSD opening is required to allow flow from the LV, through the VSD, into the aorta.
- The baffle creates an LV outflow tract to direct blood into the aorta.
- The VSD must be large enough to allow unrestricted flow into the aorta but if not, must be enlarged.

**803 Figure 19. Surgical repair for double-outlet right ventricle with subaortic ventricular septal defect. A tunnelling patch (yellow) is used to direct flow from the left ventricle into the aorta. Attention is paid to avoid flow restriction under the patch and damage to the conduction system.**

- The patch or baffle used to create the new LV outflow tract (often called a tunnel) must be capacious enough not to restrict flow and may consist of a patch or part of a large GoreTex®/IMPRA™ tube to improve the capacity of the tunnel.
- When there is pulmonary obstruction, the RV outflow tract must be augmented. This may range from simple pulmonary valvuloplasty, to infundibulectomy, augmentation with a transannular patch, or the use of a valved conduit to reconstruct the RV outflow tract and pulmonary artery.
- Outcomes for the repair of uncomplicated DORV with subaortic VSD are good, comparable to repair of tetralogy of Fallot, with an early mortality of 2-3%.
- Late reoperation will almost always be required for pulmonary valve insufficiency.
- 19 **What are the principles of surgery for double-outlet right ventricle with a subpulmonary ventricular septal defect?**
- The repair in this group of patients is dependent on the arrangement of the great arteries.

• In patients with an anteroposterior arrangement, an arterial switch operation with the Lecompte manoeuvre is performed, with the VSD baffle separating the outflow tracts (Figure 20).

**Figure 20. Surgical repair of a simple double-outlet right ventricle (DORV) with a subpulmonary ventricular septal defect (VSD) and transposition of the great arteries, where: A) pre-operatively, the pulmonary artery (PA) can be seen closer ('committed') to the left ventricle and the aorta committed entirely to the right ventricle; and B) postoperatively, the VSD has been closed and the consequent ventriculo-arterial discordance has been corrected with an arterial switch operation. As a result, the neo-aorta now emerges from the left ventricle and the neopulmonary trunk from the right ventricle. RA = right atrium; Ao = aorta; PA = pulmonary artery; LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle; DORV = double-outlet right ventricle; nPA = neopulmonary artery; nAo = neo-aorta; RV = right ventricle.**

- If the great arteries are side-by-side, an arterial switch procedure may be more difficult, hence an intraventricular repair with tunnelling of the aorta to the LV through the VSD may be more suitable. Where possible, an arterial switch operation is preferred as it is associated with better results.
- The Taussig-Bing anomaly is often associated with unusual coronary artery patterns and aortic arch abnormalities, and may require more complex surgery (Figure 21).

**Figure 21. Surgical repair of a Taussig-Bing anomaly: A) external anatomy consistent with transposition of the great arteries and malposition, where the aorta is anterior and to the left of a posteriorly placed pulmonary artery. The aortic arch is hypoplastic and the left subclavian artery emerges from the descending aorta. A large patent ductus arteriosus can also be seen. The coronary arrangement is 1LCx, 2R; B) internal inspection shows a subpulmonary ventricular septal defect in the perimembranous position; C) while on deep hypothermic circulatory arrest and regional antegrade perfusion to the brain and coronary arteries, the aortic arch is reconstructed with a porcine pericardial patch. The aorta is then transected; D) the arterial switch operation is performed, with division of the pulmonary trunk, coronary transfer to the neo-aortic root (rightward) and reconstruction of the neopulmonary artery with an autologous patch; E) the VSD is generally repaired with a porcine pericardial patch through the pulmonary valve (neo-aortic valve) and the ASD is repaired in the same fashion; F) the operation is completed with the reconstruction of both arterial trunks. Given the initial latero-lateral position of the vessels, the pulmonary artery is reconstructed with extensive patch arterioplasty.**

• If there is coexisting subpulmonary stenosis, an arterial switch operation is not possible, as the LV outflow tract will be narrowed in the switched heart. In this case, the options are a Rastelli operation (Figure 22) or a REV (réparation à l'etage ventriculaire) operation.

**Figure 22. Rastelli operation for double-outlet right ventricle with hypoplasia or atresia of the pulmonary valve. The ventricular septal defect (VSD) patch (yellow) tunnels the LV into the aorta (Ao). The right ventricle (RV) to pulmonary artery (PA) continuity is usually achieved through a valved conduit.**

- In both these techniques, the LV is baffled through the VSD to both outflow tracts (forming a 'double-outlet LV'), where the VSD baffle does not separate the two outflow tracts.
- Flow to the pulmonary arteries from the RV is restored with an RV-PA conduit in the Rastelli procedure. In the REV, a Lecompte procedure is used to bring the PA bifurcation in front of the aorta, and a direct anastomosis of the pulmonary trunk bifurcation to the right ventriculotomy, anteriorly augmented with a patch. In the REV, there

- is further augmentation of both outflow tracts by resection of any residual outflow septum.
- Outcomes for uncomplicated DORV and subpulmonary VSD are good, with early mortality, even in combination with aortic arch repair, approximately 5%.
- Late reoperation may be required for RVOT obstruction, subaortic stenosis, neo-aortic incompetence and root dilatation.

#### 20 **What are the principles of surgery for double-outlet right ventricle with a non-committed ventricular septal defect?**

- This lesion may not be amenable to repair, and a large proportion may require functionally single-ventricle palliation.
- Often there is an inlet VSD, too remote from either great vessel to allow intraventricular baffling or arterial switch. There may be straddling of the tricuspid or mitral valve apparatus across the VSD rendering it unseptatable (Figure 23), or there may be multiple muscular VSDs.

**Figure 23. Examples of an unseptatable ventricle in double-outlet right ventricle: A) tricuspid valve chordae attached to the crest of the ventricular septal defect, making the tunnelling from the morphological left ventricle to the aorta too narrow; B) straddling mitral valve.**

• Often, an early palliative procedure may allow growth to determine the ultimate feasibility of septation.

#### 21 **What are the outcomes of surgery in patients with double-outlet right ventricle?**

- Surgical results for biventricular repair in congenital anomalies with DORV are good, both in cases of primary repair and in those with staged repair.
- Surgical mortality is low in the modern era, ranging from <5% in less complicated variants, but rising to 20-25% in more complex forms.
- Early reinterventions (within 30 days) are required in up to 10-15% of cases, with the 5-year survival 85-90%.
- The commonest causes for reoperation at 5 years are LV outflow tract obstruction, the need for RV to pulmonary artery conduit replacement, and previous repair of AVSD.

#### 22 **Describe the therapeutic options for double-outlet right ventricle with functionally univentricular physiology**

- Where DORV occurs in hearts with a remote VSD that precludes septation, unbalanced ventricles, complex atrioventricular valvular abnormalities or multiple VSDs, a functionally single-ventricle palliation route may be necessary.
- Early evidence suggesting a systemic morphological LV may have better outcomes as a functionally single ventricle has been superseded by outcomes in hypoplastic left heart syndrome, in which all systemic ventricles are a morphological RV.
- In general, the 5-year survival from birth is approximately 70%. The 10-year survival after Fontan/TCPC completion is approximately 80%.

#### 23 **What is the burden of double-outlet right ventricle in congenital surgical practice?**

- Although DORV appears in only 1% of congenital cardiac defects, the more complex cardiac anomalies with this form of ventriculoarterial connection take up a disproportionate focus of multidisciplinary team meetings and surgical team decision-making.
- Neonatal repair in DORV hearts may be complex due to the intracardiac baffling required, with potential narrowing in both outflow tracts, jeopardy of the conduction pathways, and the risk of myocardial injury due to long ischaemic times and unusual coronary patterns.

• This is reflected in the high 30-day reintervention rates. As these children grow, there is an ongoing burden of reoperations for both left and right ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
