# Hypoplastic left heart syndrome

**David R. Anderson**

- 1 **What is hypoplastic left heart syndrome?**
- Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a term used to describe a combination of cardiac defects in which the left ventricle is unable to support the systemic circulation.
- True hypoplasia of the left heart, defined as the presence of a fully formed (or structurally normal) left heart of pathologically small but proportional dimensions, is rare (Figure 1).

**Figure 1. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome with a patent but too small mitral valve (MV) and aortic valve (AoV). The left ventricle (LV) is also proportionally small ('borderline LV'). The right ventricle (RV) forms the cardiac apex. ASD = atrial septal defect.** *Image reproduced with permission from Diane E. Spicer, Heart Institute, Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, St. Petersburg, Florida, USA.*

- Instead, HLHS represents a spectrum of anatomical scenarios (Figures 1-5) in which the ventricular septum is intact, atrioventricular and ventriculo-arterial connections are both concordant and the atrial chambers are usually normal in size, but associated with a:
  - a) mitral valve which may be stenotic, dysplastic or atretic;
  - b) left ventricle which may be slit-like and extremely small as in mitral atresia (Figure 2) or present a reduced cavity due to concentric hypertrophy with or without endocardial fibroelastosis, as in mitral stenosis (Figure 3);
  - c) aortic valve which may be similarly atretic, severely dysplastic and/or stenotic (Figure 4);
  - d) coronary artery arrangement which is usually normal in location and perfused from retrograde flow down the ascending aorta coming via the main pulmonary artery, through the arterial duct and backwards along the aortic arch. Cases

**Figure 2. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome with mitral valve atresia. Note the tiny slit-like left ventricle (LV) but no endocardial fibroelastosis. The marked bulging of the interatrial septum (IAS) from left to right suggests restriction of pulmonary venous return from the left atrium (LA) to the right atrium (RA) during foetal life.

- with a stenotic aortic valve may have some antegrade contribution from the LV;
- e) ascending aorta and arch which may be thread-like, as is usual with aortic valvar atresia, or small to near normal, as with aortic stenosis (Figure 5);

- f) isthmus which may be small and tapering, frequently associated with a coarctation shelf in the pre-ductal position;
- g) systemic circulation (including coronary circulation) which is almost invariably supported by an interatrial communication, the right ventricle, pulmonary trunk and persistently patent arterial duct (Figures 5 and 6).
- Although varying degrees of left ventricular hypoplasia can be found with other conditions (such as atrioventricular septal defect with right ventricular dominance, or double-outlet right ventricle with mitral atresia), by definition, these variants are included in the group of functionally univentricular hearts but are not considered hypoplastic left heart syndrome variants even though they may undergo the same surgical treatment.
- Conditions where the left ventricle is smaller than expected, with patent mitral and aortic valves, are considered 'borderline' left

ventricles, with some authors describing the combination as the hypoplastic left heart complex.

- It can then be challenging to determine whether these left ventricles can sustain the systemic circulation. In some of these patients, this may be achieved only at rest, with minimal or no capacity to increase cardiac output in response to exercise because there is no ability to increase stroke volume.
- Several anatomical and functional algorithms have been developed to try and predict the behaviour and development of such hearts with borderline ventricles, but none have proved definitive.

#### 2 **What is the developmental origin of hypoplastic left heart syndrome?**

- Since the ventricular septum is intact, it may be presumed that the trigger disturbing the growth of the left ventricle occurs after 8 weeks of gestation, which is the usual time at which the embryonic interventricular communication undergoes closure. Hence, the syndrome might be considered an acquired disease of foetal life.
- One frequently cited theory for cessation of growth postulates that, at some point in foetal life, blood is diverted from passing right to left through the oval foramen, thus reducing flow through the left heart and thereby eliminating the stimulus for normal development.

- Multiple genetic factors may produce the trigger for such diversion of flow but no single factor has been identified as causative.
- The progressive nature of the disease is demonstrated by foetuses shown in mid-pregnancy to have stenotic aortic valves, with reasonable left ventricular size and function, which at term have progressed to aortic atresia with severe left ventricular dysfunction.

#### 3 **Describe the subclassification of hypoplastic left heart syndrome**

- Since the syndrome involves acquired foetal disease of the mitral and aortic valves, there are three possible combinations:
  - a) combined mitral and aortic atresia;
  - b) mitral stenosis with aortic atresia;
  - c) combined mitral and aortic stenosis.

### 4 **Describe the cardiac anomalies associated with hypoplastic left heart syndrome**

• Intact or near-intact (highly restrictive) atrial septum (approximately 10% of patients, Figures 2 and 7) — which carries a poor prognosis,

- unless there is an alternative connection decompressing the pulmonary venous return.
- Tricuspid valve dysplasia.
- Aberrant right subclavian artery which may take origin from the distal aortic arch beyond the left subclavian artery, passing behind the trachea and oesophagus to reach the right arm.
- Extracardiac abnormalities are infrequent. There may, however, be a family history of less severe left-sided cardiac defects, such as coarctation, bicuspid aortic valve or a combination of these on the side of both parents.

# 5 **What is the epidemiology of hypoplastic left heart syndrome?**

- The condition occurs approximately once per 5000 live births, with a male predominance of 2:1.
- HLHS is the fourth most common cardiac defect and the most common lesion producing a functionally univentricular heart.

#### 6 **What is the pathophysiology of hypoplastic left heart syndrome?**

- In the presence of an unrestrictive atrial communication, during gestation, the condition has little impact on the systemic circulation and perfusion, as it is supported by the right ventricle through a patent arterial duct.
- Following birth, the same set up continues to provide for both the pulmonary and systemic circulations, which are now behaving as systems in parallel. Blood passes through the arterial duct and down the descending aorta, with flow to the upper body and coronary arteries retrogradely through the aortic arch.
- Shortly after birth with the progressive reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), the arterial duct will naturally close, which produces a sudden and severe drop in systemic perfusion that has lethal consequences unless treatment is rapidly administered to reopen the duct.
- Given the nature of parallel circulations, the RV stroke volume is distributed according to the relative resistance in the pulmonary and systemic circulations. The pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) naturally falls over the first few days of life and as it does, pulmonary blood flow increases at the expense of systemic flow unless cardiac output increases. The lower PVR results in a drop in diastolic pressure thereby compromising coronary perfusion. A vicious cycle

- can quickly ensue leading to cardiac arrest if no intervention is made. This is referred to as pulmonary over-circulation with 'coronary steal'.
- Progressive heart failure due to pulmonary overflow with systemic hypoperfusion and lactic acidosis develops that will be lethal if untreated.
- If there is a severely restrictive interatrial communication, it is important to recognise this during gestation, as the obstruction to flow has been linked to the development of lymphatic and pulmonary vascular bed changes that may cause irreversible elevated pulmonary vascular resistance precluding any surgical palliation. After birth, the same lesion will produce profound hypoxia. Attempts have been made to balloon dilate a severely restrictive interatrial septum in utero but with limited success.
- If HLHS is recognised before birth, and appropriate treatment is instituted after delivery to maintain ductal patency, and ensure adequate interatrial mixing, reasonable stability can be maintained for a few days.

# 7 **What is the natural history of hypoplastic left heart syndrome?**

- Intrauterine death, although uncommon, is known to occur in up to 10% of cases.
- If untreated, 70% of affected neonates will die within 1 week of birth following closure of the arterial duct, with very few alive after 1 month.
- Survival depends on the arterial duct remaining patent, which occasionally happens spontaneously, and the pulmonary vascular resistance remaining elevated, thus preventing excessive pulmonary flow and cardiac work.
- Despite this, such survivors will inevitably develop pulmonary vascular disease. If the pulmonary vascular resistance drops significantly, heart failure rapidly develops.
- In the presence of a restrictive or intact atrial septum, life-threatening hypoxia usually occurs immediately after birth.

# 8 **What are the symptoms and signs of hypoplastic left heart syndrome?**

- Ideally, babies with the syndrome are diagnosed during foetal life.
- The baby will be born looking normal with arterial saturations often above 90%. There is usually no murmur.
- With time, tachycardia and tachypnoea, with an increased work of breathing become evident combined with grunting.

- Examination reveals weak or absent femoral pulses, cool mottled peripheries and often hepatic enlargement.
- Urinary output may be reduced or absent.
- While the arterial duct remains open, there may be no cardiac murmur.
- Oxygen saturations are often near normal with unrestrictive interatrial communication whilst the arterial duct is open, with no significant difference between pre- and post-ductal oxygen saturation or blood pressure measurements.
- Arterial blood sampling is initially normal but as over-circulation develops or the arterial duct closes, reveals a metabolic acidosis and increasing serum lactate. Venous oxygen saturation will be low, with a widening arteriovenous oxygen gap.

# 9 **Describe the principles of diagnosis with hypoplastic left heart syndrome**

• Ideally, the condition will be diagnosed by foetal echocardiography, in mid-pregnancy or at least before delivery (Figure 8).

![](_page_8_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Figure 8. Echocardiographic A) four-chamber and B) corresponding colour flow Doppler foetal images demonstrating a normal heart with ventricles and atria of equal size, and normal flow.**

• At this stage, it is also important to recognise integrity of the atrial septum, to see if there is any restriction of left-to-right flow (Figure 9).

![](_page_9_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 9. Echocardiographic four-chamber foetal image demonstrating hypoplastic left heart (HLH) syndrome, with no left ventricular cavity seen. RV = right ventricle; RA = right atrium; LA = left atrium. The diagnostic feature is that only three chambers are evident owing to the hypoplasia of the left ventricle.**

- The first line of postnatal diagnosis is clinical examination. Symptoms and signs of heart failure coupled with weak femoral pulses in the first hours after birth should prompt the suspicion of HLHS or other left heart obstructive lesions.
- Chest radiograph may demonstrate congested lung fields but may be unremarkable prior to closure of the arterial duct. Later, the lung fields may look plethoric, with an enlarged cardiac silhouette.
- In patients with an intact or highly restrictive atrial septum, the chest radiographical appearances will mimic those of obstructed total anomalous pulmonary venous connections, with severe pulmonary congestion and/or lymphangiectasia.
- The electrocardiogram will show the right ventricular dominance typical of most neonates.
- Echocardiography is the mainstay of diagnosis and will demonstrate a slit-like left ventricular cavity typical of the atretic mitral valve or the globular left ventricle with mural hypertrophy typical of mitral and aortic stenosis. The right ventricle will be apex-forming and any restriction of the atrial septum can also be identified.

- In cases where the anatomy of the aortic arch has not been delineated by echocardiography, high-resolution computed tomographic scanning is useful. With modern fast scanners, anaesthesia can be avoided, making it preferable to magnetic resonance imaging, which requires general anaesthesia.
- Cardiac catheterisation has little to offer, carries a significant risk and should be avoided.
- Post-delivery, an echocardiogram is performed to confirm the anatomy and add detail to the foetal diagnosis, including:
  - a) patency of the arterial duct;
  - b) presence of impaired right ventricular function, significant tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary valve stenosis or regurgitation — all of which carry a poor prognosis;
  - c) anatomy and patency of the pulmonary veins;
  - d) patency and size of the interatrial communication;
  - e) anatomy of the mitral valve (Figure 10);
  - f) anatomy and size of the LV, in particular the effect of the LV hypoplasia to overall heart synchrony and function;
  - g) anatomy and size of the aortic valve and ascending aorta (Figure 11);
  - h) anatomy and size of the aorta, from the coronary arteries to the isthmus region, especially the presence and severity of coarctation, as well as the presence of retrograde flow and its quantification.

# 10 **What are the treatment options for hypoplastic left heart syndrome?**

- In developed countries, it is now usual for the great majority of cases to be diagnosed during foetal life.
- Good practice now dictates that all options available at any centre (Figure 12) are presented to the parents during one or more consultations, normally conducted by a paediatric cardiologist and/or cardiac surgeon, often in concert with support services, nursing and obstetric staff to:
  - a) offer evidence-based information on the therapeutic options, as provided by local practice, as well as a more general practice;
  - b) illustrate the options of non-intervention, termination and endof-life care;
  - c) support the parents through the decision-making process, and then through any option chosen, depending on their choice and the availability of support.

#### • The main options available include:

a) termination of pregnancy — with the law varying between countries, as to what gestational age that this may be allowed, if at all;

- b) continuation of pregnancy followed by no active intervention and end-of-life care — with no intervention offered after birth beyond the care that would be offered if the baby was thought to be completely healthy. The baby may, therefore, be born at home, or in a non-specialist centre and subsequently nursed wherever the parents choose;
- c) surgical interventions including staged-palliation and heart transplantation, when available.
- Where the diagnosis is made during foetal life, the baby should be delivered at or nearby a specialised paediatric cardiac centre. Before any operation can take place, the baby must first be stabilised. Initial survival is totally dependent on the patency of the arterial duct, which will remain open if an infusion of prostaglandin is instituted soon after birth.
- The baby can usually be fed from the breast, but care is needed to look out for necrotising enterocolitis. Some babies may need nasogastric feeding.
- In the presence of increasing work of breathing and signs of overcirculation, elective paralysis and ventilation may be required to prevent cardiorespiratory failure.
- In cases with a highly restrictive or intact atrial septum, it may be wise to attempt balloon dilatation of the foramen ovale, and then reassess the lungs for signs of lymphangiectasia before moving on to palliative surgery.
- Primary heart transplantation for HLHS has been used only in selected centres, as it is limited by the availability of donor organs prior to collapse or deterioration of the patient.
- Staged surgical palliation includes three operations intended to develop a 'Fontan circulation' and include:
  - a) stage 1 where the right ventricle (RV) is connected to the systemic circulation (with a Damus-Kaye-Stansel procedure), the arch repaired, and provision made for pulmonary blood flow. This can be achieved using a classic Norwood, Sano modification of the Norwood operation (where an RV-PA shunt is used instead of a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt for pulmonary blood flow) or a hybrid procedure (where the branch pulmonary arteries are individually banded and patency of the arterial duct maintained either by stenting or continued prostaglandin infusion);
  - b) stage 2 where pulmonary blood flow is provided by a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt (BCPS), with the superior vena cava anastomosed to the pulmonary artery;

- c) stage 3 where the inferior vena cava is connected to the pulmonary arteries (total cavopulmonary connection [TCPC]) either by a conduit external to the heart (extracardiac Fontan) or an intra-atrial tunnel (lateral tunnel).
- 11 **What are the principles of the stage <sup>I</sup> Norwood procedure for surgical palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome?**
- Disconnection of the pulmonary trunk from the lungs, proximal to the bifurcation, followed by connection of the pulmonary valve and trunk to the aorta (Damus-Kaye-Stansel procedure), thus creating a neoaortic trunk.
- Any points of obstruction to systemic blood flow are relieved, such as a coarctation or aortic arch enlargement.
- A source of blood flow to the lungs is then created (Figure 13), using a:
  - a) modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (classic Norwood procedure);

**Figure 13. Stage I palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome including construction of the neo-aorta (Damus-Kaye-Stansel anastomosis), the right ventricle as the systemic ventricle and aortic arch repair, with: A) modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (classic Norwood procedure); B) left-sided RV-PA shunt (Sano modification); and C) right-sided RV-PA shunt (Birmingham modification). Rt BTS = right Blalock-Taussig shunt; RA = right atrium; LA = left atrium; SVC = superior vena cava; IVC = inferior vena cava; RV = right ventricle; RPA = right pulmonary artery; LPA = left pulmonary artery; LV = left ventricle; Neo-Ao = neo-aorta; PA = pulmonary artery.**

- b) RV-PA conduit, which effectively creates a double-outlet right ventricle. The conduit can be placed to the left of the neo-aortic trunk (Sano modification) or to the right of the neo-aortic trunk (Birmingham modification).
- The atrial septum is excised to ensure unrestricted flow of pulmonary venous return to the right atrium.
- Echocardiography is used to confirm adequate systemic and pulmonary blood flow (Figure 14).

# 12 **What are the principles of the stage II procedure for surgical palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome?**

• The second stage of palliation is usually performed at age months.

• Angiography by cardiac catheter, MRI or CT may be used to delineate the systemic and pulmonary blood flow and anatomy prior to surgery (Figure 15). It is important to define any stenoses of the pulmonary arteries and confirm normal pulmonary vascular resistance before surgery.

- Using cardiopulmonary bypass, the previously implanted systemic to pulmonary shunt (modified BT shunt) or RV-PA conduit (Sano shunt) is disconnected.
- The superior vena cava is disconnected from the right atrium and then connected to the right pulmonary artery, creating a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt (BCPS, Figure 16).
- An alternative technique, the hemi-Fontan operation, achieves the same objective without disconnecting the superior vena cava from the right atrium.
- During this stage, additional procedures may be undertaken, including:
  - a) surgical enlargement (or stenting) of pulmonary artery stenoses, more frequent on the LPA;
  - b) repair of the tricuspid valve (now the systemic atrioventricular valve);

- c) relief of subpulmonary stenosis, coarctation of the aorta or other stenoses;
- d) relief of pulmonary vein stenosis.
- 13 **What are the principles of the stage III procedure for surgical palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome?**
- This procedure is performed between years of age and establishes the Fontan circulation to complete the palliation strategy.

• Angiography, MRI or CT may be used to delineate the anatomy prior to surgery (Figure 17). It is vital to confirm normal pulmonary vascular resistance by measuring pulmonary artery pressure.

A small arteriovenous collateral has been coiled.** *Image courtesy of Dr. Trevor Richens, University Hospital Southampton, UK.*

- The operation involves connecting the inferior vena cava (IVC) to the pulmonary arteries, thus redirecting the remaining systemic venous return to the lungs producing a total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC, Figure 18). This can be achieved using several different techniques, including:
  - a) extracardiac TCPC where the IVC is excised from the right atrium and connected via a Gore-Tex® tube graft (its diameter indexed to body surface area) that passes around the outside of the RA and in front of the right pulmonary veins, to the pulmonary artery opposite the previously implanted BCPS.

![](_page_19_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 18. Stage III palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome with: A) extracardiac total cavopulmonary connection, where a Gore-Tex® tube has been implanted between the inferior vena cava (IVC) and right pulmonary artery in the right pericardial fossa; B) intracardiac total cavopulmonary connection, where a tube of Gore-Tex® is implanted between the IVC and the pulmonary artery, passing through the atrial cavity, separating it from the pulmonary venous return. BCPS = bilateral cavopulmonary shunt; RA = right atrium.**

This technique avoids cardiac arrest, and some centres perform it without cardiopulmonary bypass;

- b) lateral-tunnel Fontan operation which is used mostly when a hemi-Fontan was performed at stage II. It involves opening the right atrium and creating an intra-atrial tunnel between the orifice of the IVC and the pulmonary arteries, using the free wall of the atrium and a patch of Gore-Tex® or pericardium to complete the tunnel. This technique requires both cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest;
- c) intracardiac TCPC where a tube of Gore-Tex® is implanted between the IVC and the PA, passing through the atrial cavity instead of the pericardial fossa. This is normally used where the extracardiac technique is not feasible anatomically, such as with malaligned pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins, heterotaxy and dextrocardia, and anomalies of pulmonary

venous return. This technique requires both cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest.

#### 14 **What are the principles of the hybrid procedure for hypoplastic left heart syndrome?**

- In the first few days of postnatal life, survival of the patient is dependent on patency of the arterial duct. The size of the duct partly determines the degree of systemic blood flow, together with the relative resistances of the systemic and pulmonary vascular beds.
- An alternative to the Norwood procedure is the hybrid procedure, where RV perfusion to the systemic and pulmonary circulations is achieved by maintaining patency of the arterial duct with a stent or continued prostaglandin infusion, instead of an anastomosis between the arterial trunks.
- Pulmonary over-circulation can then be controlled by placing bands on the right and left pulmonary arteries, via a median sternotomy. More recently, flow limiters have been inserted percutaneously into the branch pulmonary arteries thereby avoiding any surgery in the neonatal period.
- In these circumstances, the stent can be introduced through the pulmonary trunk proximal to the duct, thus avoiding damage to small peripheral vessels (Figure 19).

**Figure 19. Angiographic images obtained during a hybrid procedure for hypoplastic left heart syndrome in a small neonate (<2.5kg): A) anteroposterior view demonstrating banding of both pulmonary artery branches and surgical cannulation of the main pulmonary artery to allow stenting of the arterial duct; B) lateral view allowing the catheter and stent to be introduced into the arterial duct simultaneously under direct vision and fluoroscopy.** *Images courtesy of Dr. Trevor Richens, University Hospital Southampton, UK.*

- It is important to ensure a wide communication exists between the left and right atria, which can be achieved using a Rashkind balloon septostomy.
- The procedure is performed without cardiopulmonary bypass.
- Some centres prefer to use a prostaglandin infusion rather than stents after placing pulmonary artery bands (Figure 20). Avoiding PDA stenting in neonates with HLHS and aortic atresia, where the coronary arteries are perfused retrogradely via the aortic arch, may be beneficial to avoid the risk of distal aortic arch occlusion and subsequent myocardial ischaemia.
- Following a hybrid strategy, the stage I Norwood procedure can be performed after a delay of 4 to 6 weeks. This creates a four-stage surgical pathway.
- Alternatively, stages I and II of Norwood palliation can be performed as a combined procedure at months either by creating a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt or performing a hemi-Fontan procedure.

#### 15 **What are the advantages and disadvantages between the techniques for stage I palliation?**

• In general, it is institutional preference and experience that determines the choice between a classic Norwood procedure, the Sano modification or a hybrid procedure.

- Pulmonary blood flow is essential to oxygenate blood, with postoperative oxygen saturations 75-80% generally ideal. Higher saturations mean higher pulmonary blood flow, often at the expense of systemic flow, resulting in poor tissue perfusion, renal failure, and death from low systemic cardiac output syndrome.
- The Classic Norwood procedure is the oldest technique and several programmes have established excellent results with this technique. It uses a shunt attached to the brachiocephalic artery to provide pulmonary blood flow. The only incision into the myocardium is through the right atrium where the venous cannula for bypass is inserted. Through this the atrial septectomy can be performed. Surgical damage to the ventricle is avoided. The Sano modification requires an incision into the RV to connect the shunt, inevitably causing some damage and scar.
- In the classic Norwood procedure, pulmonary blood flow is derived from the systemic arterial system. Run-off to the lungs causes lower diastolic blood pressure. This in turn affects coronary arterial perfusion, and thus cardiac function (coronary steal).
- In comparison, the Sano modification means that pulmonary blood flow is derived from RV ejection with no diastolic steal from the systemic circulation. In general, it provides a more stable immediate postoperative course and may be associated with less mortality before the second stage operation. Set against that is the potential longer-term detrimental effects of the RV incision where the shunt was connected. It is associated with more pulmonary artery distortion especially when sited to the left but the Birmingham modification of siting it to the right has made that less of a problem (Figure 21).
- As regards the hybrid procedure, it may be beneficial to avoid prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass in the neonatal period and perhaps especially so where the diagnosis of HLHS was made after postnatal collapse or in babies born with a low birth weight (<2.5kg and definitely <2kg). The procedure, however, is complex and requires a steep learning curve. In addition, certain conditions, such as aortic atresia, may be relative contraindications especially if there is pre-ductal coarctation.
- Combining stage I and II operations following the hybrid procedure is a more complex operation and often requires reconstruction at the PA band sites, thus increasing cardiopulmonary bypass time.
- Currently, there is no conclusive evidence of the superiority of either the classic Norwood procedure or the Sano approach. A randomised trial conducted between showed a survival benefit in favour of the Sano procedure at 1 year but this disappeared between years postoperatively.

#### 16 **What are the indications and contraindications for surgical palliation?**

- Given the near certainty of death without intervention, the diagnosis alone is an indication for intervention, provided the parents are fully informed of the risks, the series of operations with frequent hospitalisations, the subsequent limitations on effort capacity, and the continuing uncertainty as to the long-term outcome.
- Several factors have been identified as conferring additional risk, and may constitute a relative or near absolute contraindication, including:
  - a) extreme prematurity with gestational age <32 weeks conferring a very high risk and gestational age weeks adding moderate increased risk;
  - b) low birth weight with a weight 2.5-3kg indicating the need for high level of caution and weight <2.5kg adding increasingly high risk as the weight lowers;
  - c) additional cardiac lesions contributing to poor right ventricular systolic function — including severe atrial septal restriction, moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation (especially if structural as compared to functional), pulmonary valve dysfunction or obstructed pulmonary venous drainage;

- d) rhythm disturbances including congenital atrioventricular block or absence of sinus rhythm;
- e) non-cardiac conditions including major neurological injury, congenital syndromic abnormalities affecting potential developmental progress, necrotising enterocolitis, diaphragmatic hernia, motor defects of the legs, pulmonary lymphangiectasia, renal agenesis or tracheal stenosis.

# 17 **What are the main risk factors for peri-operative mortality in hypoplastic left heart syndrome?**

- The stage I procedure, irrespective of the specific technique in use, carries the highest risk, with 30-day mortality of 10-15% in highvolume, high-quality programmes.
- Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is at times required to allow recovery of cardiac function, where early postoperative deterioration develops.
- After the stage I, there is an ongoing risk of death (inter-stage attrition), which can be improved with close surveillance and employing a home-monitoring protocol.
- The stage II procedure is a relatively low-risk operation, with a 30-day mortality of 2-3%, and little attrition thereafter such that survival at age 1 year is 70-75%.
- After stage II, the risk of inter-stage mortality is relatively low, as is the risk of death at the stage III operation (2-4%).
- Survival into adolescence, therefore, remains quite good, with only a small risk of death.
- Beyond that, although the number of patients who have undergone the Norwood sequence is small, some are alive aged 30 years and more.

# 18 **Describe the morbidity associated with surgical palliation of hypoplastic left heart syndrome**

- The stage I procedure represents high-risk surgery, with all the known complications of neonatal cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass.
- The stage II procedure also carries all the risks of redo cardiac surgery in general, but a few particular complications, including:
  - a) prolonged pleural drainage or chylothorax;
  - b) cyanosis, especially in the presence of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance;

- c) diaphragmatic palsy requiring plication;
- d) pulmonary artery stenosis, requiring intervention;
- e) pulmonary artery thrombosis, especially in the presence of bilateral superior vena cavae.
- The stage III procedure poses similar risks to the stage II procedure but also:
  - a) thrombosis of the Fontan circuit, especially with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and 'slow' Fontan flow;
  - b) paradoxical embolism through a patent fenestration.

#### 19 **What is the long-term prognosis for hypoplastic left heart syndrome?**

- The longest survivors of the Norwood sequence are no more than years old, and they are very few.
- Complications common to all Fontan-type circulations have been seen to emerge from early or mid-teenage years and onward.
- As fewer and fewer patients undergo a classic Fontan operation, problems with atrial dilatation, thrombosis and severe arrhythmias are seen less often.
- Even with the widely used extracardiac or intracardiac tunnels, morbidity is prevalent and includes:
  - a) arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or flutter;
  - b) pulmonary arterial stenosis;
  - c) tricuspid valve dysfunction;
  - d) residual or emergent obstruction of the aortic arch;
  - e) deteriorating cardiac function, with diastolic dysfunction being nearly universal;
  - f) protein-losing enteropathy, abdominal ascites, hepatic congestion and cirrhosis, and plastic bronchitis.
- Some may respond to interventions, such as replacement of the tricuspid valve or dilatation and stenting of stenosis of the pulmonary arteries or aortic arch.
- Ultimately, however, the only therapy likely to affect prognosis is heart transplantation, which is limited by the general shortage of donor organs.
- Wearable ventricular assist devices, nonetheless, have been used as destination therapy in selected patients with single-ventricle circulation.
