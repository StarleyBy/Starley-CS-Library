#### What is truncus arteriosus?

 Truncus arteriosus (or common arterial trunk) is a cardiac malformation where only one great artery (trunk) arises from the ventricular mass branching and gives origin to the coronary, systemic and pulmonary circulations (Figure 1).

# What are the major anatomical features of truncus arteriosus?

- Truncus arteriosus is defined anatomically by the:
  - a) presence of a single arterial trunk and its truncal valve;
  - b) almost constant presence of an interventricular communication;

- c) intrapericardial branching pattern of the pulmonary arteries;
- d) coronary artery pattern;
- e) pattern of the conduction system.
- The trunk usually has only one semilunar valve (truncal valve) with a number of cusps ranging from one to six. A tricuspid valve is the most frequent type (42-61% of cases), followed by quadricuspid (24-31% of cases) and bicuspid (5% of cases) (Figure 2). Truncal valves with one, five or six leaflets are extremely rare. The semilunar truncal valve is generally located above a ventricular septal defect, and can present with dysplastic thickened and deformed cusps, resulting in stenosis, regurgitation (in at least 20% of cases) or both.

- A ventricular septal defect, which is almost invariably present, is caused by the absence of the infundibular septum. It is generally high, anterior and unrestrictive, with additional defects occasionally seen. Absence of a ventricular septal defect is rarely reported.
- The pulmonary arteries branching and origin can vary greatly. It provides the basis for the commonly used classifications. Most authors agree that the so called truncus arteriosus Type IV, with neither pulmonary arterial branch arising from the truncus arteriosus, is not considered as a true type of truncus arteriosus, but rather a variant of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect.

- Stenosis at the origin of one or both branches of the pulmonary arteries is reported in 2-10% of patients.
- The origin of coronary arteries presents with a variable pattern, independent of the number of truncal valve leaflets.
- The conduction system can rarely present with variations, which are mostly dependent upon the location and extent of the ventricular septal defect.

# 3 **Describe the classification of truncus arteriosus**

- A few classifications have been published and used for several decades. The first was proposed by Collett and Edwards in 1949. It focused on the anatomy of the origin of the pulmonary branches but did not account for several variations. It is rarely used today.
- The second, proposed by Van Praagh in 1965, reported some modifications, including the Type A4, with interruption of the aortic arch.
- The most recent classification, by Jacobs on behalf of the Congenital Heart Surgery Nomenclature and Database Project, is a modification of the Van Praagh classification. It focuses on a description principle of the lesion as observed, redefining it as truncus arteriosus with either predominantly aortic or pulmonary arterial characteristics. This definition allows for description of all the anatomical possibilities associated (Figure 3).

**Figure 3. Classifications of truncus arteriosus. Jacobs' Types A1 to A3 describe a truncus arteriosus with predominantly aortic characteristics, while A4 describes truncus arteriosus with predominantly pulmonary characteristics and an interrupted aortic arch.**

• In clinical practice, the most frequently observed form is somewhere in between Type 1 and 2, where the origins of the two pulmonary arteries are very close but still separated, and in the common language this has been categorised as Type 1.5 (Figure 4).

# 4 Which cardiac anomalies are associated with truncus arteriosus?

- Right aortic arch is frequent (18-36%).
- Truncal valve regurgitation (23%) or stenosis.
- Coronary artery abnormalities (18%), including single coronary artery and intramural course.
- Aortic arch interruption (Figure 5), usually of Type B (11-14%), and aortic coarctation are accompanied by patent ductus arteriosus, when associated with truncus arteriosus.

- Non-confluent pulmonary arteries occasionally occur with truncus arteriosus (5%), where one of the pulmonary arteries originates either from a patent ductus arteriosus or from a major aortopulmonary collateral artery.
- Persistent left superior vena cava, total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, tricuspid atresia, complete atrioventricular septal defect, single ventricle, double aortic arch, anomalous origin of circumflex coronary artery from right pulmonary artery, situs inversus and dextrocardia have also been reported in rare occasions.
- Approximately 35% of children with truncus arteriosus have 22q11 microdeletion, while 30-35% present with DiGeorge syndrome (velocardiofacial syndrome), which is also called CATCH-22 that includes a cardiac defect, craniofacial dysmorphism, and hypoplasia of the thymus and parathyroid gland.

#### 5 **Describe the embryology and molecular genetics of truncus arteriosus**

- Truncus arteriosus is characterised by two primary defects:
  - a) complete absence of the pulmonary infundibulum;
  - b) complete or partial absence of the aorticopulmonary septum.

- Recent experimental studies confirmed the importance of neural crest cells in the embryology of truncus arteriosus. A specific population of neural crest cells in chick embryos migrate to the region of the aorticopulmonary septum, and the ablation of this region of the neural crest resulted in the formation of a truncus arteriosus.
- Investigations into the genetic basis of the conotruncal anomalies, such as truncus arteriosus and tetralogy of Fallot, have identified genetic regulators of neural crest cell function and migration necessary for the outflow tract septation, including Tbx3 and Pax3. Tbx1, a T-box transcription factor located on chromosome 22q11, has been implicated in the development of DiGeorge syndrome, present in 33% of neonates with truncus arteriosus. Tbx1 is necessary for the adequate development of the outflow tract and the pulmonary infundibulum, and is also a regulator of neural crest migration, further linking it to the process of outflow tract septation.
- The development and septation of the outflow tract are quite complex, with numerous other signalling pathways implicated, including the Wnt signalling pathway.

# 6 **What is the epidemiology of truncus arteriosus?**

- Truncus arteriosus is a rare congenital heart defect, with a reported incidence of 0.16-1.27 per births.
- It represents 0.4-4.0% of all congenital heart defects.

# 7 **What is the pathophysiology of truncus arteriosus?**

- Truncus arteriosus is a malformation with complete blood mixing at both the ventricular and ventriculo-arterial junction levels, resulting in the same oxygen saturations in the aorta and pulmonary arteries.
- The balance between systemic and pulmonary blood flow, and the subsequent level of systemic oxygen saturation, depends upon the ratio between systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance.
- In the immediate postnatal period, pulmonary blood flow is reduced by the presence of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, causing subsequent cyanosis, with systemic oxygen saturation around 75- 80%.
- With the exception of the rare group (<10%) with obstruction to the pulmonary blood flow due to a stenotic origin of the pulmonary artery component, the decrease of pulmonary vascular resistance over the first few weeks of life is usually accompanied by an increase in the total pulmonary blood flow. This pulmonary over-circulation (left-to-

right shunt) can frequently become very significant, reducing the diastolic and mean aortic pressure and resulting in reduced coronary artery perfusion.

- The clinical consequences of this pathophysiological pattern are:
  - a) cyanosis which is caused by mixing of desaturated and oxygenated blood in the truncus arteriosus;
  - b) congestive heart failure which is caused by the significant left ventricular volume overload and right ventricular pressure overload;
  - c) myocardial ischaemia which is caused by the left-to-right shunt towards the pulmonary circulation resulting in coronary artery steal.
- The result of pulmonary over-circulation and increased myocardial work is an increased resting oxygen demand and decreased metabolic reserve, with progressive metabolic acidosis and myocardial dysfunction.

# 8 **What is the natural history of truncus arteriosus?**

- Truncus arteriosus left untreated carries a very high mortality in early infancy, due to congestive heart failure and myocardial ischaemia.
- Without treatment, 50% of patients will die within the first month of life and 80% within the first 3 months.
- Sudden death can also occur during infancy, secondary to the combination of myocardial ischaemia and a malformed dysfunctional truncal valve, with either severe stenosis or regurgitation.
- The presentation of a young adult or older patient with truncus arteriosus surviving beyond infancy with the development of pulmonary vascular obstructive disease is very rare.

#### 9 **Describe the clinical presentation of <sup>a</sup> patient with truncus arteriosus**

- Symptoms are variable, depending upon the specific anatomical features and age at presentation, including poor feeding, shortness of breath, wheezing, grunting, restlessness and mild to moderate cyanosis.
- Physical examination may reveal tachypnoea, nasal flaring or respiratory distress, usually due to airway compression and pulmonary congestion.

- Cardiovascular signs include bounding peripheral pulses, tachycardia, hyperdynamic praecordium, an ejection click at the left upper sternal border and a single 2nd heart sound (due to the single outlet). The presence of a conspicuous diastolic murmur or loud systolic ejection murmur suggests the presence of severe regurgitation or stenosis of the truncal valve, respectively.
- Hepatic and jugular venous distension, and facial swelling may occur in the presence of congestive heart failure.

#### 10 **What are the electrocardiographic features of truncus arteriosus?**

- Although electrocardiographic (ECG) findings are not specific to allow the diagnosis of truncus arteriosus, right, left or biventricular hypertrophy may be present, with or without ST-T changes, depending on the presence of truncal valve abnormalities and/or myocardial ischaemia.
- Left atrial enlargement may be seen in patients with substantial pulmonary over-circulation.

#### 11 **What are the chest radiographical features of truncus arteriosus?**

- Chest radiograph generally shows cardiomegaly, with a narrow superior mediastinum, due to the absence of the pulmonary trunk segment, increased pulmonary arterial vascularity and lung hyperinflation.
- In patients with a right aortic arch (18-36% of cases), airways compression, particularly of the left bronchus, may be seen.

#### 12 **What are the echocardiographic features of truncus arteriosus?**

- Echocardiography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of truncus arteriosus in almost all patients, providing all the information needed for surgical decision-making.
- The parasternal long-axis and subcostal views show the single great artery arising from the ventricles, with variable override of the ventricular septum, the origin of the pulmonary arteries (Figure 6), their intrapericardial morphology and the presence of any potential stenosis (Figure 7).

LPA = left pulmonary artery; RPA = right pulmonary artery.**

• The parasternal short-axis view, as well as the apical and subcostal views, allow the truncal valve function to be evaluated, with colour flow Doppler grading the presence of stenosis or regurgitation (Figures 8 and 9).

**Figure 9. A) Echocardiographic subcostal view demonstrating a stenotic truncal valve, with B) mild regurgitation on the corresponding colour flow Doppler image.**

- These images also allow identification of other anatomical features, including:
  - a) any additional ventricular septal defects;
  - b) relationship of the atrioventricular valves with the ventricular septal defect and the truncal valve (Figure 10);
  - c) origin and course of the proximal coronary arteries (Figure 11).

• The high parasternal and suprasternal view can be used to define the position of the aortic arch and the presence of any aortic arch interruption.

#### 13 **What are the indications for cardiac catheterisation in a patient with truncus arteriosus?**

- Cardiac catheterisation is not usually part of the standard preoperative assessment.
- It is poorly tolerated in very sick neonates and is only used if CT or MRI scanning are not available.
- It may also be required for further anatomical evaluation, where uncertain findings on echocardiography are identified or to rule out uncommon associated defects (Figure 12).

- For physiological evaluation, in borderline cases of infants with late presentation and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, cardiac catheterisation can quantify the degree and reversibility of pulmonary hypertension, by testing the reactivity of the pulmonary circulation to intravenous or inhaled pulmonary vasodilators, such as oxygen and nitric oxide.
- In older children, cardiac catheterisation can be used to rule out the presence of pulmonary vascular obstructive disease.

• Calculation of pulmonary and systemic blood flow and resistance is difficult because of complete mixing.

#### 14 **Describe the role of cross-sectional imaging in <sup>a</sup> patient with truncus arteriosus**

- Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning are performed during pre-operative evaluation in selected groups of infants with truncus arteriosus when echocardiography is not sufficient or during the work-up of the occasional older patient with an unrepaired lesion.
- They can help to delineate the:
  - a) precise morphology of the truncus arteriosus, including the identification of the origin of the pulmonary arteries, the distance between the origin of the pulmonary component and the origin of the left main coronary artery, and potential anomalies of the coronary arteries (Figures 13-16);

- b) anomalous pulmonary venous connections;
- c) presence of any aortic coarctation, aortic arch interruption or anomalies of the arch branches;
- d) anomalies of the pulmonary arteries, such as disconnections or 'absent' pulmonary artery, where either the left or the right pulmonary artery originates from a ductus arteriosus or from a major aortopulmonary collateral artery.
- In particular, cross-sectional imaging is useful to determine the mediastinal relations of truncus arteriosus, including:
  - a) airway or oesophageal compression, which is particularly frequent with right aortic arch (Figure 17);
  - b) congenital anomalies of the airways, such as complete rings, malformed cartilages, or malacia.

#### 15 **What are the indications for surgical repair of truncus arteriosus?**

- The diagnosis of truncus arteriosus constitutes an absolute indication for surgical repair, unless severe comorbidities are identified.
- Several centres have reported favourable results with the repair, and when possible, prenatal counselling should prepare the parents for the surgical strategy.

#### 16 **What are the principles of pre-operative management for truncus arteriosus?**

- Neonates tend to be stable during the first days of life, due to the high pulmonary vascular resistance.
- With the drop in pulmonary vascular resistance, pulmonary overcirculation generally occurs, with congestive heart failure and

- potential coronary artery steal due to the large shunt distal to the arterial valve.
- Signs such as tachypnoea, dyspnoea, tachycardia and myocardial dysfunction can accompany cyanosis. Oxygen administration is not necessary but also can be detrimental because it may increase pulmonary overflow, reduce systemic perfusion and cause ventricular volume overload.
- Failure of medical therapy and non-invasive positive pressure respiratory support may indicate urgent intervention.
- In the 11-14% of neonates with associated aortic arch interruption, it is essential to maintain ductal patency with a prostaglandin infusion. In these patients, parenteral feeding should be considered, as enteral feeding may be associated with complications.
- Truncal valve dysfunction represents a challenging risk factor. When considering pre-operative stratification, the feasibility of valve repair needs to be taken into account.
- In the absence of the results of chromosome 22q11 investigation, irradiated blood should be prepared for all neonates undergoing surgery.

#### 17 **What are the principles of surgery for truncus arteriosus?**

- The majority of units offer a single-stage complete repair of the lesion, especially high-volume centres.
- The staged approach, with bilateral pulmonary artery banding or plication of the origin of the pulmonary artery component, with or without strategies to maintain ductal patency in cases with interrupted aortic arch, is still a valid alternative in cases with severe comorbidities, such as infection precluding the use of cardiopulmonary bypass and very low birth weight.
- Although standard preparation is used for cardiopulmonary bypass, specific attention needs to be given to myocardial protection. Antegrade trunk-injection of cardioplegia can be only effective with the occlusion of both pulmonary branches to avoid run-off (Figures 18 and 19).
- When interrupted aortic arch is present, the arch reconstruction should be performed first, during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest with regional perfusion of the brain and coronary arteries, with the remainder of the repair performed during slow rewarming (Figure 20).

- The surgical technique consists of three major steps, including:
  - a) separation of the pulmonary artery component from the truncus, which at this point becomes the neo-aorta (Figure 21);
  - b) closure of the ventricular defect with a patch, normally through a longitudinal right ventriculotomy (Figure 22A);
  - c) connection of the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery component with a biological valved conduit (Figure 22B).
- Truncal reconstruction into a neo-aorta can be obtained either directly or with a patch (pericardium or PTFE), depending on the size, vicinity of the coronary ostia, need for root plasty and any interventions required on the valve. Patch closure is the preferred technique.

- VSD closure can be performed through the right ventriculotomy in most cases, given the subarterial position of the defect, which avoids damage to the truncal valve and conduction system. Additional muscular VSDs when present can be closed via the right atrium.
- Valveless conduits are rarely used as a connection between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery. Most centres use valved conduits, such as homografts, bovine jugular vein and Hancock™ valves. Size and availability may direct the choice of conduit.
- Alternatively, it is possible to perform a direct anastomosis of the posterior wall of the pulmonary component to the posterior edge of the right ventriculotomy, completing the connection with a pericardial or PTFE roof, with or without a monocusp pulmonary valve (which is known as the réparation à l'étage ventriculaire [REV] procedure). This technique is best suited in Type A1 truncus arteriosus, where a suitable common pulmonary trunk is available.
- Associated lesions are treated during the same procedure, especially in the presence of aortic coarctation or interrupted aortic arch.
- Truncal valve plasty is a challenging part of the procedure. In the presence of moderate to severe truncal valve regurgitation, particularly with a quadrileaflet valve, a reduction plasty to three leaflets with leaflet excision and annular remodelling can substantially reduce the degree of valvular regurgitation.
- In patients with a stenotic truncal valve, reconstructive truncal valve surgery is more difficult and replacement with a homograft or mechanical valve may be required.

### 18 **What are the outcomes of repair for truncus arteriosus?**

- As truncus arteriosus is a rare congenital heart defect, there are only a few surgical series with a large number of patients, with historical data reporting wide ranging hospital mortality rates.
- Recent series report hospital mortality between 3-5% in selected patients.
- The European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery (EACTS) registry reports a hospital mortality of 17.7% (181 deaths over 1224 reported cases).
- The Society of Thoracic Surgeons' registry reports a hospital mortality of 10.9% (62 deaths over 572 cases).
- In all reports, the hospital mortality substantially increases with associated lesions, such as when surgery of the truncal valve is required (up to 30%) or in the presence of aortic arch interruption (up to 60%).

• Reporting on a staged strategy is limited to small series and case reports, with the pre-operative risk being increased with comorbidities, such as low birth weight.

#### 19 **What are the potential complications following surgical repair of truncus arteriosus?**

- In the immediate postoperative period, echocardiography is the most suitable investigation to rule out any residual defects, including:
  - a) residual ventricular septal defect;
  - b) residual or progressive truncal valve stenosis or regurgitation (Figure 23);

- c) residual right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (Figure 24).
- Other complications include:
  - a) arrhythmias;
  - b) complete atrioventricular block requiring permanent pacemaker;
  - c) airway compression, especially in the presence of right aortic arch and aortic coarctation or aortic arch interruption;
  - d) pulmonary hypertensive crisis.

#### 20 **What are the long-term outcomes for patients with truncus arteriosus?**

- The importance of a regular clinical follow-up in patients after repair of truncus arteriosus increases with their age, because of potential anatomical and functional issues, requiring appropriate investigation with echocardiography, cardiac catheterisation with angiography, CT scan and MRI.
- Potential late complications include:
  - a) progressive neo-aortic valve dysfunction, particularly regurgitation, with potential dilatation of the neo-aorta (Figure 25);
  - b) right ventricular outflow tract obstruction at the level of the proximal or distal anastomosis (Figure 26). This is due in most cases to calcification or outgrowth, with potential aneurysmal dilatation of the right ventricular outflow tract (Figure 27);
  - c) aortic arch obstruction, especially after surgery for associated aortic coarctation or arch interruption;
  - d) extrinsic compression of the airway (Figure 28), especially in the presence of a right aortic arch or previous aortic arch surgery.

- The goals of an adequate long-term postoperative follow-up include assessing the adequacy of:
  - a) left and right ventricular volumes, function and mass;
  - b) neo-aortic valve function (Figure 29);
  - c) function of the coronary arteries (Figure 30);
  - d) right ventricular outflow tract, valved conduit and branch pulmonary arteries (Figure 31);
  - e) aortic arch and isthmus;
  - f) airways.
