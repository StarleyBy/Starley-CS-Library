### Tetralogy of Fallot

**Osami Honjo**

#### 1 **What is Tetralogy of Fallot?**

- Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD), and it constitutes a wide spectrum of presentations all considered conotruncal lesions, or lesions of the right ventricle outflow tract and the ventriculo-arterial junction.
- TOF has four recurrent anatomical features including aortic override, the presence of a ventricular septal defect (VSD), right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction, and right ventricular hypertrophy (Figure 1).
- These are all attributable to the anterocephalad deviation of the infundibular septum coupled with hypertrophy of the septoparietal trabeculations.

Anderson, Biosciences Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.*

#### 2 **What is the embryology of tetralogy of Fallot?**

- The anatomical features of TOF develop during conotruncal development between the 5th and 6th week of human embryological development.
- When anterior deviation of the developing infundibular septum occurs, it prevents complete alignment between the primitive ventricular septum and infundibular septum, allowing for an interventricular communication (IVC), and overriding of the aorta over it.
- The combination of the deviated infundibular septum and hypertrophied septoparietal trabeculations causes RVOT obstruction.
- Right ventricular hypertrophy is considered as a haemodynamic consequence of RVOT obstruction.

#### 3 **What are the epidemiology and aetiology of tetralogy of Fallot?**

- The prevalence of TOF is 0.21 to 0.36 per 1000 live births.
- TOF accounts for approximately 7-10% of all congenital heart diseases.
- The exact aetiology is largely unknown, with most cases sporadic, although some familial cases have been reported (missense mutation in JAG1).
- 22q11 deletion is seen in 12-20% of the patients with TOF.

#### 4 **Describe the phenotypical spectrum of tetralogy of Fallot**

- TOF has a wide spectrum of anatomical and physiological presentations, which depend on the degree of anterior deviation of the infundibular septum and RVOT obstruction (Figure 2).
- The vast majority of patients with TOF have an elongated RVOT when compared to normal hearts, which contributes to the creation of the funnel-like structure of the RVOT, thus compounding the degree of stenosis (Figure 3).
- Anatomical variations, however, also include those attributable to the type of VSD, the relation of the aortic valve to the tricuspid valve, the relation of the aortic valve to the pulmonary valve and coronary artery anatomy (Figure 4).

**Figure 2. Distribution of presentation of tetralogy of Fallot by the degree of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (RVOTO). The majority of phenotypes within the spectrum present with moderate to severe degrees of right ventricular outflow tract stenosis. Tetralogy of Fallot with very mild right ventricular outflow tract stenosis or no stenosis is called Eisenmenger defect, whereas at the opposite end of the spectrum is tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia.**

#### 5 **What abnormalities are associated with tetralogy of Fallot?**

- A patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect is the most common associated lesion (pentalogy of Fallot).
- Other associated abnormalities include:
  - a) additional muscular ventricular septal defects;
  - b) straddling of the tricuspid valve;
  - c) atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD-TOF);
  - d) double-outlet right ventricle (DORV-TOF);
  - e) pulmonary atresia (TOF-PA);
  - f) right aortic arch.

- Coronary artery abnormalities in TOF are not uncommon, including:
  - a) anomalous origin of the left anterior descending coronary artery from the right coronary artery (2-3%);
  - b) accessory left anterior descending artery from the right coronary artery (5-6%);
  - c) single coronary artery.
- Anomalies of the pulmonary artery branches, mainly attributable to their intrapericardial course (Figure 5).

**Figure 5. Anatomical variations of the pulmonary artery branches in tetralogy of Fallot.**

#### 6 **What are the determinants of the pathophysiology in tetralogy of Fallot?**

• The pathophysiology of TOF is determined by the degree of RVOT obstruction, the size and position of the VSD, the degree of right ventricular hypertrophy, and the presence of associated lesions.

- Obstruction is usually characterised as:
  - a) 'fixed' when it is independent of the physiological or metabolic status of the patient and caused by anatomical factors, such as pulmonary and suprapulmonary valve stenosis;
  - b) dynamic when it can vary in relation to the degree of existing hypoxia, hydration, or sympathetic activation and caused by RVOT muscle contraction. In moderate to severe forms of TOF, both mechanisms usually concur to the overall degree of flow obstruction.
- VSD anatomy and position can alter the amount of flow shunting across the septum, where a restrictive VSD can limit the flow in either direction, and a larger and subarterial VSD is more prone to causing significant volume and pressure overload to the pulmonary circulation.
- The degree of RV hypertrophy determines the degree of stiffness and the resulting diastolic dysfunction of the RV. Severe forms of hypertrophy can result in restrictive physiology of the right ventricle, which is defined by persistent flow across the RVOT during diastole. The diagnosis of restrictive physiology is usually obtained by echocardiography (Figure 6).

**Figure 6. Echocardiographic parasternal short-axis biventricular view of tetralogy of Fallot demonstrating severe diffuse thickening of the right ventricle. RV = right ventricle; LV = left ventricle.** *Image courtesy of Dr. Tara Bharucha, University Hospital Southampton, UK.*

- When TOF is associated with other complex lesions, such as PA, AVSD or DORV, the resulting physiology is often that of the most dominant lesion, although the dominant physiological character could be enhanced. For example, TOF-PA will present with extreme degrees of cyanosis due to the complete obstruction of any pulmonary blood flow.
- These patients present with a duct-dependent pulmonary circulation and are totally prostaglandin-dependent, if no collateral circulation has developed. On the contrary, the combination of mild obstruction and AVSD can produce a picture of severe pulmonary overload, pulmonary oedema and early cardiac failure.

## What are the common pathophysiology scenarios in tetralogy of Fallot (Figure 7)?

 TOF patients with minimal or mild RVOT obstruction (mild to no pulmonary stenosis, mild RVOT muscle hypertrophy, mild RV diastolic dysfunction) have a large left-to-right shunt across the VSD, due to the lower pulmonary vascular resistance. In these patients, the

#### Degree of RVOT obstruction

**Figure 7.** Physiological behaviour, clinical symptoms and oxygen saturation levels in a patient with tetralogy of Fallot, according to the degree of RVOT stenosis.

intracavitary pressure in the right ventricle is equal to that of the left ventricle (systemic right ventricle) and the lungs receive both volume and pressure overload via the VSD (known as 'over-circulation'). This is similar to isolated VSD physiology, resulting in various degrees of congestive heart failure ('pink tetralogy') and failure to thrive, often evident at an early age.

- The physiology of TOF patients with moderate RVOT obstruction and even significant flow acceleration across the RVOT (>4m/sec) can be well balanced, with shunting across the interventricular communication generally in both directions. Right-to-left shunting can still occur due to the increased resistance to flow across the RVOT when compared to systemic vascular resistance, which accounts for the relative cyanosis.
- In general, appropriate pulmonary blood flow is maintained, but not pressure overloading, and so is the systemic one, resulting in adequate body perfusion. Symptoms can be very mild, growth is generally maintained and cyanotic spells are infrequent.
- When RVOT obstruction gets severe, shunting across the interventricular communication is predominantly right-to-left due to the increased resistance to flow across the RVOT when compared to systemic vascular resistance. In these patients, flow velocity can be difficult to measure as little flow occurs. Although pulmonary blood flow can be critically reduced, systemic flow can be normal until bradycardia and biventricular failure occur due to hypoxia. Symptoms can be very severe from cyanosis, cyanotic spells and even true cardiorespiratory collapse due to protracted, profound hypoxia. Growth can be maintained but these neonates are generally critically ill.
- TOF patients with extreme RVOT obstruction (including those with TOF-PA) and no appreciable antegrade flow across the pulmonary valve have a duct-dependent pulmonary circulation. Arterial saturation depends on the size and degree of restriction of the ductus arteriosus. As the duct naturally begins to close on day of life, oxygen saturations can drop rapidly, due to reduced pulmonary blood flow and right-to-left shunting. The systemic circulation is maintained mainly by shunting across the VSD as pulmonary venous return is also reduced. These patients require resuscitation and medical intervention for survival.

#### 8 **What is the natural history of tetralogy of Fallot?**

• Survival in untreated patients is approximately 75% at 1 year of age and 30% at 10 years of age in most reported series.

• The major cause of death in patients with unrepaired TOF includes hypoxic spells (62%) and cerebrovascular events (30%).

#### 9 **What are the symptoms of tetralogy of Fallot?**

- Neonates with TOF and severe RVOT obstruction may present with significant cyanosis at birth. The degree of cyanosis depends on the status of the ductus arteriosus (duct-dependent pulmonary circulation).
- Infants with mild or minimal RVOT obstruction may or may not present with non-specific symptoms of congestive heart failure, including poor feeding, weight gain and tachypnoea, because of a large left-to-right shunt. These patients generally do not have cyanosis.
- Older patients with longstanding cyanosis may have finger clubbing.
- Patients with significant RVOT may have cyanotic spells, which is common amongst unrepaired tetralogy patients older than 6 months. Physiological changes, such as dehydration, fever and resultant tachycardia and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance, may decrease the pulmonary blood flow, thus triggering a cyanotic spell.

#### 10 **What are the physical signs of tetralogy of Fallot?**

- The presence of cyanosis and a systolic ejection murmur along the left upper sternal border are the typical physical signs of a moderate to severe form of TOF.
- The second heart sound is typically single and of normal intensity.
- A continuous murmur may be audible when the ductus arteriosus is patent.
- The parasternal RV impulse may be increased and a thrill may be palpable.
- Patients usually have a normal growth pattern, although the growth may be delayed if patients have an associated syndrome.
- Infants with TOF who have minimal or mild RVOT obstruction may have clinical features of congestive heart failure, such as tachypnoea, hepatomegaly and poor weight gain.

#### 11 **What are the electrophysiological features of tetralogy of Fallot?**

• It typically shows a rightward QRS axis and various degrees of right ventricular hypertrophy.

#### 12 **What are the radiological features of tetralogy of Fallot?**

• Chest radiographs in patients with moderate to severe forms of TOF show decreased pulmonary vascular markings, an upturned apex of the heart, and a pulmonary concavity at the upper left heart border a 'boot-shaped heart' (Figure 8).

![](_page_9_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 8. Chest radiograph demonstrating some of the typical features of tetralogy of Fallot, including the near absence of the pulmonary artery silhouette with an upturned apex ('boot-shaped heart'), associated with a right aortic arch.**

- A right aortic arch can be found in up to 15% of the patients with TOF.
- The chest radiograph in acyanotic infants with TOF may be normal, or may have signs of increased pulmonary blood flow, such as cardiomegaly, an increase in pulmonary vascular markings or pulmonary congestion.

#### 13 **What are the echocardiographic features of tetralogy of Fallot?**

• Echocardiography is the most important and effective diagnostic modality for delineating the anatomy of TOF.

- Diagnosis and characterisation of TOF should be made in the context of a complete scan according to the standard echocardiographic segmental analysis of the heart.
- The degree of infundibular septal deviation can be assessed by the subcostal right anterior oblique and short-axis views (Figure 9).

![](_page_10_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 9. Echocardiographic parasternal short-axis images demonstrating anterocephalad deviation of the infundibular septum in tetralogy of Fallot. In this view, the anterior movement shifts the infundibular septum (white arrows) towards the anterior wall of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), thereby causing obstruction. LVOT = left ventricular outflow tract.** *Images courtesy of Dr. Tara Bharucha, University Hospital Southampton, UK.*

- The nature and degree of RVOT obstruction (subvalvular or infundibular, valvular and sometimes supravalvular) can be seen in the same projection. The degree of obstruction is further delineated by colour flow and pulse Doppler (Figure 10).
- Anatomy of the intrapericardial pulmonary artery tree and especially the origin of the left pulmonary artery can be seen on a 2D parasternal short-axis view (Figure 11).
- It is important to define and characterise the type and position of the VSD, and the direction and degree of the shunting (Figure 12).

• The degree of aortic override and type and size of the ventricular septal defect can be assessed on an apical four-chamber view (Figure 13).

- Echocardiography is also used to detect the presence of any anomalous coronary arteries, such as an anomalous origin of the left anterior descending coronary artery or a large coronal branch of the right coronary artery crossing the RVOT, which is crucial for the surgical decision-making. This is best seen on a parasternal shortaxis view (Figure 15).
- Systemic to pulmonary vascular collaterals may be visualised if they are present and relatively large in size but require delineation by angiography or computed tomography if present.
- Most if not all associated anomalies can and should be detected with echocardiography.

#### 14 **What are cardiac catheterisation findings in <sup>a</sup> patient with tetralogy of Fallot?**

- The role of cardiac catheterisation in diagnosing TOF is limited given the fact that echocardiography can provide detailed anatomical and physiological information on most if not all TOF features.
- A right ventricular injection can confirm the diagnosis, including the:
  - a) degree of aortic override;
  - b) degree of RVOT obstruction (Figure 16);
  - c) type and size of the VSD (Figure 17);
  - d) size and stenosis of the main and branch pulmonary arteries;
  - e) degree of right ventricular hypertrophy.
- Cardiac catheterisation is useful when the presence of major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs) is highly suspected on echocardiogram or to delineate the detailed anatomy of MAPCAs and their blood supply patterns.
- It also has an important role in catheter-based interventions for these patients pre-operatively and postoperatively.

#### 15 **What are the principles of managing <sup>a</sup> patient with tetralogy of Fallot?**

- Surgical repair is the only definitive therapeutic option for TOF.
- The role of medical treatment is to stabilise the patient's physiology until the definitive surgical repair is performed.
- Initial medical intervention depends on the clinical presentation.
- Prostaglandin E1 is used in neonates with <sup>a</sup> duct-dependent pulmonary circulation, where the PDA is still patent and/or reactive to medications. This requires intravenous access and in-hospital surveillance in a high-dependency unit or paediatric cardiology ward. Overdosing of PGE1 can lead to apnoea and resulting hypoxia, which could aggravate spelling episodes or protracted desaturations.
- Beta-blockers (for example, propranolol) are used in older infants with progressive RVOT obstruction and cyanotic spells, where the ductus arteriosus has already irreversibly closed. Although in the majority of cases beta-blockers are given orally, they can be administered intravenously in the most severe cases.
- Diuretic therapy (furosemide and or spironolactone) is used in patients with TOF who have minimal RVOT obstruction and pulmonary over-circulation.

#### 16 **What are the indications for surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot?**

- The presence of TOF is an absolute indication for surgical repair.
- The aim of surgical intervention is to provide definitive repair, by addressing all lesions included in the tetralogy or pentalogy of Fallot and re-establish a biventricular circulation, with closure of the ASD and VSD, and correction of RVOT obstruction, at all levels.
- Obviously, reactive RVH cannot be repaired and it is expected to regress once obstruction has been corrected.

#### 17 **What are the contraindications for surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot?**

- There is no absolute contraindication for surgical repair in patients with TOF, although there are some conditions that preclude a definitive repair.
- Extreme prematurity and low body weight are contraindications for primary intracardiac repair for TOF. In these cases, interventional options are indicated, such as RVOT balloon dilatation or stent placement, or ductal stenting.

- Conditions that preclude cardiopulmonary bypass, such as intracranial haemorrhage or active systemic infection, are contraindications for surgery.
- Extremely small branch pulmonary arteries and/or the presence of MAPCAs may be a contraindication for primary intracardiac repair. These patients may need staged operations.

#### 18 **What are the surgical principles of Tetralogy of Fallot repair?**

- The surgical principles of TOF repair are to achieve biventricular physiology by closing the VSD and releasing the RVOT obstruction below and at the level of the pulmonary valve.
- Repair techniques have evolved over time and have moved from an initial effort to provide an adequate pulmonary blood flow (original

Blalock-Taussig shunt or Blalock-Taussig-Thomas shunt — BTS), where the right subclavian artery was anastomosed to the right pulmonary artery, to interventions aimed at releasing the RVOT obstruction via the RVOT followed by VSD closure, to RVOT obstruction release via the right atrium and VSD closure. These were generally performed as a staged strategy (BTS or its modification first, followed by repair at 1 year of age) and generally involved the use of a patch across the pulmonary valve annulus, thus creating severe pulmonary regurgitation.

- The current trend is to complete the RVOT muscle resection and VSD closure via the right atrium to minimise muscle injury and resulting ventricular scarring, and more importantly to make every effort to preserve the pulmonary valve even when moderately stenotic, based on the notion that mild residual pulmonary stenosis is better than free pulmonary insufficiency in the long term (Figure 18).
- There has also been a significant paradigm shift from staged repair (initial palliation with a Blalock-Taussig shunt and subsequent definitive repair) to primary definitive repair in patients at any age without contraindication. In most centres, initial palliation is performed infrequently and most patients with TOF undergo primary repair.
- In cases of severe PS or near atresia where the pulmonary valve cannot be maintained, a transannular patch (TAP) is necessary to ensure adequate forward flow. In some cases, free pulmonary regurgitation can be mitigated by constructing a single cusp valve. Patients with a TAP or TAP and monocusp valve will require pulmonary valve implantation at a later stage (Figures 19 and 20).
- Following surgery, echocardiography is used to demonstrate a functioning pulmonary valve.
- Ongoing controversies in surgical strategy include:
  - a) primary versus staged repair;
  - b) use of catheter-based palliation, such as a RVOT or ductal stent versus placement of a Blalock-Taussig shunt;
  - c) transatrial transpulmonary artery approach versus a transventricular approach;
  - d) indications, timing and modality of a pulmonary valve implant in repaired patients with severe pulmonary regurgitation.
- For this reason, some maintain that true surgical resolution of TOF is not really achievable in conditions with more than mild-moderate PS, as these patients will require several reinterventions on the pulmonary valve, may require subsequent interventions for

**Figure 19. Principles of primary surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot: A) division and resection of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) muscle bands (red arrow), which is carried out via the tricuspid valve (blue arrow) accessed through the right atrium. This can resolve outflow obstruction in most cases; B) repair of the ventricular septal defect with a patch via the same access. Once the patch is positioned the tricuspid valve is tested for competence and repaired if needed; C) in cases of severe pulmonary stenosis or atresia, a transannular patch (TAP) is used to augment the annulus and the RVOT, if required; D) if the pulmonary annulus size allows (green arrow), the valve can be spared and patches can be used to augment the areas above and below the valve.**

arrhythmias and may suffer from progressive heart failure due to right ventricular dilatation.

#### 19 **Describe <sup>a</sup> treatment algorithm for tetralogy of Fallot (Figure 21)**

- Asymptomatic patients with TOF are electively operated on at months of age.
- Earlier repair is indicated when arterial oxygen saturation levels fall below 80% or if the patient has a cyanotic spell.
- Most neonates with TOF are offered primary repair unless they have a contraindication, such as:
  - a) body weight less than <2.5-2.8kg;
  - b) prematurity <36 weeks;
  - c) pathologic biventricular hypertrophy;
  - d) intracranial haemorrhage;
  - e) sepsis or infection;
  - f) significant end-organ dysfunction.
- Balloon dilatation and/or placement of a RVOT stent may be performed, if feasible.

- Patients who have RVOT dilatation or stent placement undergo elective repair at months of age or an earlier repair if arterial oxygen saturation levels fall below 80%.
- Our policy is to avoid the placement of a Blalock-Taussig shunt in the neonatal or early infantile period.

#### 20 **What are the interventional therapeutic options for tetralogy of Fallot?**

• Stent placement to a stenotic RVOT (Figure 22) is an excellent palliative option for critical cyanotic neonates and small infants who are not suitable for primary repair, and is an alternative to a Blalock-Taussig shunt (Figure 23).

![](_page_22_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 22.

- In some selective patients with isolated pulmonary valvular stenosis, balloon dilatation of the pulmonary valve without stent placement may be enough to temporarily relieve the RVOT obstruction.
- Stent placement to the patent ductus arteriosus could also be an option to increase pulmonary blood flow if RVOT stenting is not sufficient.

- The vast majority of patients undergoing repair with a transannular patch will undergo a pulmonary valve implantation at a later stage. A transvenous approach can be used via the femoral vein to deploy a stent-mounted tissue valve. Contraindications to this approach include the following:
  - a) pulmonary valve annulus or RVOT that is too wide;
  - b) highly pulsatile RVOT;
  - c) calcified, narrow conduit;
  - d) associated lesion that may require surgical intervention, such as significant pulmonary artery stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation or residual VSD.
- All patients presenting with symptomatic pulmonary regurgitation following repair of TOF should be discussed in a multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting in order to establish the best strategy (surgical or interventional) for pulmonary valve replacement based on anatomy, functional status and associated lesions.

#### 21 **What are the complications of surgical repair for tetralogy of Fallot?**

- Peri-operative mortality in patients who undergo primary repair for acyanotic TOF ranges from 0-1%.
- Hospital mortality in symptomatic neonates or small infants who undergo primary repair ranges from 1-3%.
- Complete heart block associated with VSD closure occurs in approximately 1% of patients undergoing surgical TOF repair, which requires permanent pacemaker implantation.
- Up to one third of the patients have a significant low cardiac output state due to restrictive physiology of the right ventricle.
- Residual lesions, including residual RVOT obstruction (Figure 24), pulmonary artery stenosis (Figure 25) and tricuspid regurgitation, can be significant and may or may not require surgical or catheter reintervention.

#### 22 **What are the long-term outcomes following surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot?**

- Reported survival rates are approximately 85% at 30 years following repair.
- The risk of death is approximately 0.3% per year in the first 30 years after repair, with the 40-year survival in the current era up to 90% based on very low early mortality.
- Older age at operation and a high post-repair RV/LV systolic pressure ratio are risk factors for late mortality.
- Although there are mixed results regarding impact of a transannular patch on late survival, the vast majority of those will require pulmonary valve replacement at a later stage.
- Common causes of death include cardiac-related sudden death, congestive heart failure and death related to reoperation.
- Approximately 80% of the patients are in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional Class I, and less than 10% are in Class III at the median follow-up of 30 years, although the exercise capacity of these patients is markedly impaired.
- The risk of requiring pulmonary valve replacement is constant and is approximately 0.8% per year for 30 years.
- Approximately 15-20% of the patients subsequently required reoperation (other than pulmonary valve replacement) later after TOF repair, including for residual atrial or ventricular septal defect, tricuspid valve regurgitation, residual RVOT obstruction or aneurysm formation, and branch pulmonary artery stenosis (Figure 26).
