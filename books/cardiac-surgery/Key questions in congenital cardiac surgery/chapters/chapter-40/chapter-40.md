## Cardiac tumours

**Ergin Kocyildirim, Victor O. Morell**

## 1 **What are cardiac tumours?**

• The most recent publication of the Congenital Heart Surgery Nomenclature and Database Project defines cardiac tumours as "abnormal growth of tissue in or on the heart, demonstrating partial or complete lack of structural organisation, and no functional coordination with normal cardiac tissue".

## 2 **How are cardiac tumours classified?**

- Primary cardiac tumours (Figure 1) which arise from tissues of the heart itself or the pericardium, include:
  - a) myxoma;
  - b) papillary fibroelastoma;
  - c) rhabdomyoma;
  - d) fibroma;
  - e) lipoma;
  - f) teratoma;
  - g) haemangioma;
  - h) lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum;
  - i) mesothelioma of the atrioventricular (AV) tissue;
  - j) pheochromocytoma;
  - k) sarcoma;
  - l) cardiac lymphoma.
- Secondary cardiac tumours are considered metastatic lesions, with seeding of neoplastic cells onto cardiac tissues usually occuring via the inferior vena cava to the right atrium.
- Alternatively, the lesions can be categorised as benign or malignant (Table 1).

## 3 **What is the incidence of primary cardiac tumours?**

- Primary cardiac tumours are rare, with the published incidence in autopsy series and foetal echocardiograms varying between 0.02% and 0.32%.
- The wide range is due to the improvement in non-invasive imaging techniques, more intensive routine echocardiographic screening and the increased application of foetal ultrasonography.
- About 14% of all cardiac tumours occur in patients who are less than 16 years of age.

## 4 **What is the incidence of secondary cardiac tumours?**

- In autopsy series, the incidence of secondary cardiac tumours in children is approximately 6%.
- The most common tumours causing secondary involvement in the heart in children are non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumour, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, and hepatoma.

## 5 **What are the signs of cardiac tumours?**

- Symptoms and signs of cardiac tumours are related to the size, location and the growth rate of the tumour rather than histology type.
- They can vary from asymptomatic to life-threatening cardiac events in relation to obstruction to flow, valvular dysfunction, impaired myocardial function and embolisation.
- The most common signs include tachycardia, cardiac murmur and evidence of systemic embolisation.
- Left atrial tumours are responsible for 25% of all tumour embolisation to the:
  - a) cerebral and retinal arteries;
  - b) mesenteric branches;
  - c) renal arteries;
  - d) limb arteries (occasionally).

#### 6 **What are the principles of diagnosis of <sup>a</sup> cardiac tumour?**

• Tumours developing during early gestation should be detected during foetal scanning (Figure 2). Current standards of practice expect a full cardiac consultation at the time of first diagnosis, although tissue diagnosis and gestational course may not be predictable at that time.

LV = left ventricle; MV = mitral valve; LA = left atrium; RA = right atrium; TV = tricuspid valve; RV = right ventricle.** *Image courtesy of Dr. Tara Bharucha, University Hospital Southampton, UK.*

- Echocardiography remains the mainstay of diagnosis and in some cases can provide a definitive diagnosis, such as with myxoma. More often, however, the detection of an intracardiac mass is not enough to provide a specific tissue diagnosis.
- Electrocardiographic changes are very common, especially in paediatric presentation, but are usually non-specific.
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scanning and angiography are useful in refining the anatomical characteristics of the mass and its effects.

#### 7 **What are the chest radiographical features of cardiac tumours?**

- A chest radiograph may detect the presence of:
  - a) cardiomegaly due to cardiac enlargement and/or pericardial fluid (Figure 3);
  - b) mediastinal widening (Figure 4);
  - c) pleural effusion;
  - d) evidence of congestive heart failure, such as pulmonary oedema;
  - e) mediastinal calcification.

#### 8 **What are the electrocardiographic features of cardiac tumours?**

- Although electrocardiographic changes in patients with cardiac tumours are very common, they are generally non-specific and include:
  - a) arrhythmias every type of arrhythmia has been reported in association with cardiac tumours;
  - b) ST-T segment changes which can occur as focal, acute events following coronary embolisation or as diffuse, longlasting changes with myocardial infiltration.
- Evidence of strain and ventricular hypertrophy, secondary to the blood flow obstruction, may also be present.

#### 9 **What are the echocardiographic features of cardiac tumours?**

- Echocardiography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of cardiac tumours, with 2D, 3D, Doppler interrogation and tissue Doppler indices (TDI) all useful to identify the anatomical and functional characteristics of the cardiac mass, including:
  - a) size;
  - b) location intracavitary, intramyocardial;
  - c) attachment sessile, pedunculated;
  - d) relation to other structures valve (Figure 5), outflow tract;
  - e) growth rate (with serial examinations);
  - f) blood flow obstruction (Figure 6);
  - g) associated lesions;
  - h) pericardial or pleural effusions (Figure 7) which are often associated with malignant tumours.
- Vegetations, cysts and thrombi need to be considered as a differential diagnosis of cardiac and pericardial masses.
- In some cases, such as myxomas, the echocardiographic characteristics of the cardiac mass can be diagnostic.

#### 10 **What are the features of cardiac tumours on crosssectional imaging?**

- CT chest and cardiac MRI are important adjuncts to echocardiography in defining the anatomy, tissue definition and borders of the tumours (Figure 8).
- MRI can be quite sensitive and specific in the diagnosis of intracavitary tumours, often being able to provide the tumour type in the majority of cases, except intramural masses, which are generally less well defined.
- MRI can complement echocardiography in assessing the characteristics of the tumour, including:
  - a) location, size and boundaries;
  - b) relation to the myocardium, valvular tissue and blood vessels;
  - c) involvement of the pericardium, pericardial cavity, great vessels and nerves;
  - d) involvement of the airways, and mediastinal and hilar structures;
  - e) effects on blood flow, cardiac function and cardiac output.

• They are also useful in follow-up management (Figure 9), whether or not surgical resection has taken place.

#### 11 **What are the principles of management for <sup>a</sup> primary cardiac tumour?**

• Primary malignant cardiac tumours (angiosarcomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, leiomyosarcomas and fibrosarcomas) are very rare and represent 10% of primary cardiac tumours in children.

![](_page_10_Picture_5.jpeg)

Rhabdomyosarcoma of the right atrium: A) the neoplastic process involves the right atrial wall, the atrioventricular junction, including the triangle of Koch, the atrioventricular groove and the coronary sinus ostium; B) following tumour debulking, a pericardial patch in inserted, but the extent of resection is limited to preserve the coronary sinus, posterior descending artery and the conduction system.

- They can originate from any chamber of the heart and the pericardium but usually remain asymptomatic until they produce metastases.
- The prognosis is very poor and the expected survival in untreated patients is less than a year.
- Chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgical excision are the available treatment options.
- Benign primary cardiac tumours are usually successfully treated by surgical resection, as tumour growth tends to be non-invasive and slow.
- Depending on the histology type, the treatment can vary from a conservative approach to aggressive surgical resection. The principles of resection are comparable to those of general oncology surgery, and complete resection with wide margins to avoid recurrence should be sought in all cases.
- The extent of the resection of malignant tumours is often limited by the need to preserve specialised tissues, such as the conduction system and coronary arteries (Figure 10).
- As a result, local recurrence and disease progression are frequent, and may necessitate repeat procedures.
- In patients with extensive involvement of cardiac structures, complex surgical reconstruction may be required, such as valve replacement using a pulmonary autograft.

#### 12 **What are the principles of management for <sup>a</sup> secondary cardiac tumour?**

- By definition, secondary cardiac tumours are metastatic lesions and management will depend on the primary lesion. In children, metastatic cardiac lesions are more common than the primary cardiac tumours.
- The most common malignancies in children with metastatic spread to the heart are lymphomas, neuroblastomas and extracardiac sarcomas.
- The surgical options for the incurable malignancies with cardiac invasion are limited.
- In patients with a Wilms' tumour, resection of intracaval and intracardiac extension of the tumour and removal of thrombus extension has proven to be safe and reliable in the long term (Figure 11).

IVS = interventricular septum; RV = right ventricle; RA = right atrium; LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle.**

## 13 **What are the principles of surgery for cardiac tumours?**

- The surgical strategy and approach for cardiac tumours depends on the location and the extent of the tumour, including:
  - a) extrapericardial and pericardial masses which tend to be excised without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, except for lesions involving the great vessels and veins;
  - b) atrial lesions which are usually accessed via a right atriotomy, with left atrial lesions requiring an additional incision in the interatrial septum;
  - c) right ventricular and outflow tract lesions which are usually resected via the right atrium but may require a right ventriculotomy in certain circumstances;
  - d) left ventricular tumours which can be accessed via the aortic or mitral valves, to avoid a left ventriculotomy, if possible,

especially in small children. In tumours where the ventricular mass is severely compromised or if extensive resection is required, a Norwood procedure or heart transplant may be warranted.

• Reconstruction follows the general principles of surgical reconstruction for non-neoplastic congenital lesions.

#### 14 **What are the principles of treatment for <sup>a</sup> rhabdomyoma?**

- Rhabdomyomas are the most common type of primary cardiac tumours in children.
- Spontaneous regression is reported in 50-100% of these patients.
- Asymptomatic children can be followed up with regular echocardiographic evaluation.
- Surgical resection is indicated for refractory arrhythmias and obstruction to blood flow.

## 15 **What are the principles of treatment for <sup>a</sup> myxoma?**

- Myxomas are the most common primary cardiac tumour in adults and represents 50% of all adult benign cardiac tumours. Myxomas, however, are rare in children.
- They tend to be multi-lobulated masses with a frail consistency prone to embolisation, usually attach to the atrial wall, with a pedicle or a wide base, and in 75%, originate in the left atrium (Figure 12).

**Figure 12. Cardiac myxoma with a typically multi-lobulated appearance and a sessile base.** *Images courtesy of Mr. Pietro Malvindi and Mr. Theo Velissaris, University Hospital Southampton, UK.*

• The diagnosis of myxoma is an indication for its surgical removal and the tumour should be excised completely because of the risk of recurrence (Figure 13).

**Figure 13. Surgical management of a pedunculated left atrial myxoma: A) following cardiopulmonary bypass and cardiac arrest, access can be obtained through a right atriotomy (Ra), left atriotomy (La) via Waterston's groove or a left atrial roof incision (Lar). A small portion of the atrial septum is resected along a circumference 3-4mm around the root of the pedicle and the tumour is carefully extracted; B) the interatrial communication is then closed either primarily or with a pericardial patch following wide septal resection (\*). IVS = interventricular septum; RV = right ventricle; RA = right atrium; LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle.**

## 16 **What are the principles of treatment for <sup>a</sup> fibroma?**

- Cardiac fibromas are the second most common primary cardiac tumour in children.
- Asymptomatic children with a fibroma are normally treated conservatively and followed up with serial echocardiography.

- Complete surgical resection is indicated for refractory arrhythmias or haemodynamic compromise. If the tumour is compromising the conduction system, a partial resection should be considered.
- In cases of extensive infiltration of cardiac walls, a heart transplant should be considered.

## 17 What are the principles of treatment for an angioma?

- Angiomas are rare and often diagnosed incidentally.
- Surgical resection is indicated for small, well isolated, symptomatic tumours.
- Asymptomatic patients are treated conservatively and followed up with serial echocardiography.

## 18 What are the principles of treatment for an intrapericardial teratoma?

- Teratomas are generally benign neoplasms containing elements of endodermal, mesodermal and neuroectodermal germinal layers (Figure 14).
- Intrapericardial teratomas are rare.
- Early diagnosis is often obtained during an antenatal scan, and counselling is required at diagnosis.

- Pericardial effusions are common and may be diagnosed as early as the 2nd to 3rd trimester. The compression effect of tumour mass and pericardial fluid often results in severe foetal cardiovascular compromise, leading to hydrops which occurs in approximately 77% of affected foetuses. Prenatal development of foetal hydrops accurately predicts the fate of foetuses with teratoma.
- In utero pericardiocentesis and evacuation of the pericardial fluid is a life-saving approach in those foetuses, as it may relieve venous return obstruction and delay the progression of hydrops.
- Early surgical removal of the mass in the neonatal period is the treatment of choice and is generally curative.
