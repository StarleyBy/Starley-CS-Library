## Anomalous pulmonary venous connections

**Syed M. Rehman, Antonio Ravaglioli, Nicola Viola**

## 1 **What is an anomalous pulmonary venous connection?**

- Pulmonary venous anomalies represent congenital defects of the pulmonary veins and comprise a spectrum of abnormalities including:
  - a) partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection (PAPVC);
  - b) total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC);
  - c) atresia of the common pulmonary vein;
  - d) cor triatriatum;
  - e) abnormal absorption of the common pulmonary vein into the left atrium.

### 2 **Describe the embryological formation of the pulmonary veins**

- The common pulmonary vein arises from an outpouching of the left atrium at days' gestation. It then bifurcates twice to produce four pulmonary veins, which grow towards the developing lungs.
- The lung buds develop from the foregut and drain to the splanchnic venous system of the embryo (Figure 1).
- A plexus of veins from the mesoderm envelop the bronchial buds and meet with the developing pulmonary veins to form a connection at the fifth week of gestation.
- The common pulmonary vein is gradually incorporated into the left atrial wall (Figure 2), until all four pulmonary veins enter the posterior wall of the left atrium separately (Figure 3). The incorporated pulmonary veins form the smooth posterior wall of the left atrium, whilst the trabeculated portion of the left atrium forms the more ventral aspect.

### 3 **Describe the classification of pulmonary venous anomalies**

- Primary anomalies of pulmonary venous connection:
  - a) partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection:
    - i) non-Scimitar PAPVC (Figure 4A);
    - ii) Scimitar PAPVC (right pulmonary vein draining into the inferior vena cava) (Figure 4B);

**Figure 5. Subtypes of total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC): A) supracardiac TAPVC; B) cardiac TAPVC; and C) infracardiac TAPVC. IAC = interatrial communication; IVC = inferior vena cava.**

- Atresia of the common pulmonary vein.
- Cor triatriatum:
  - a) accessory atrial chamber that receives all pulmonary veins and communicates with the left atrium:
    - i) no other connections (classic cor triatriatum);
    - ii) other anomalous connections, including:
      - connection to the right atrium;
      - total anomalous pulmonary venous connection;

- b) accessory atrial chamber that receives all the pulmonary veins but does not communicate with the left atrium:
  - anomalous connection to the right atrium directly (cardiac TAPVC with all pulmonary veins first draining to a venous confluence);
  - ii) supracardiac or infracardiac TAPVC;
- c) subtotal cor triatriatum:
  - i) accessory atrial chamber that receives part of the pulmonary veins and connects to the left atrium, with the:
    - remaining pulmonary veins connecting normally;
    - remaining pulmonary veins connecting anomalously (partial cor triatriatum with PAPVC);
  - accessory atrial chamber that receives part of the pulmonary veins and connects to the right atrium, with the:
    - remaining pulmonary veins connecting normally (PAPVC with anomalously connected pulmonary veins first draining to a venous confluence);
    - remaining pulmonary veins connecting anomalously (mixed TAPVC).
- Stenosis of individual pulmonary veins:
  - a) congenital.
  - b) acquired:
    - i) postoperative;
    - ii) other.

## 4 What is the aetiology of anomalous pulmonary venous connection?

- Primary anomalies of pulmonary venous connection occur if the common pulmonary vein becomes atretic, either partially or totally, whilst the pulmonary to venous connections persist. This results in a partial or total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, respectively.
- Atresia of the common pulmonary vein occurs if the common pulmonary vein fails to develop in the absence of pulmonary to systemic venous connections.
- Cor triatriatum results from stenosis of the common pulmonary vein.
- Pulmonary vein stenosis is the only pulmonary venous anomaly that may also be acquired, usually postoperatively.

## 5 **What abnormalities are often associated with anomalous pulmonary venous connection?**

- Partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection:
  - a) atrial septal defect (90% of cases), with the majority being the sinus venosus type but some with a secundum atrial septal defect (10%);
  - b) intact atrial septum (3%);
  - c) heterotaxia syndromes;
  - d) right lung hypoplasia and dextrocardia (with Scimitar-type venous connection) in Halasz syndrome.
- Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection:
  - a) atrial septal defect;
  - b) patent foramen ovale;
  - c) patent ductus arteriosus.
- Atresia of the common pulmonary vein:
  - a) ventricular septal defect;
  - b) atresia of the aortic and pulmonary valves;
  - c) asplenia;
  - d) facial dysmorphia.
- Cor triatriatum:
  - a) tetralogy of Fallot;
  - b) double-outlet right ventricle;
  - c) aortic coarctation;
  - d) ventricular or atrioventricular septal defect;
  - e) left-sided superior vena cava with coronary sinus atrial septal defect;
  - f) asplenia or polysplenia.
- Pulmonary vein stenosis:
  - a) atrial or ventricular septal defect;
  - b) all major congenital cardiac abnormalities.

## 6 **What is the epidemiology of anomalous pulmonary venous connection?**

- Partial anomalous pulmonary venous connections have an incidence of 0.6-0.7%, are more common in females and occur in 10% of patients with an atrial septal defect.
- Total anomalous pulmonary venous connections occur in 1.5% of patients with congenital cardiac abnormalities, with the infracardiac type being three times more common in males.
- Other pulmonary venous anomalies are rare.

## 7 **What is the pathophysiology of anomalous pulmonary venous connection?**

- Partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection:
  - a) the ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow (Qp:Qs) is predominantly determined by and proportional to the number of anomalous pulmonary venous connections;
  - b) in addition, the source of the anomalous pulmonary veins is also important, with pulmonary blood flow being greatest to the middle and lower lobes in an upright patient, hence anomalous pulmonary venous drainage to the right atrium will be greatest if arising from those lobes;
  - c) any associated atrial septal defect may also exacerbate the leftto-right shunt;
  - d) progressive right heart dilatation can eventually lead to arrhythmias, right heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.
- Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection:
  - a) since all pulmonary venous return is to the right atrium, right heart volume overload occurs;
  - b) right heart pressure increases if there is pulmonary venous obstruction or if there is restriction of flow across the atrial septum. Increased pulmonary blood flow may result in pulmonary hypertension;
  - c) the cardiac index may also reduce due to decreased left-sided blood flow.

### • Cor triatriatum:

a) pathophysiological changes depend on the extent of communication between the proximal and distal chambers of the left atrium;

b) the obstruction of pulmonary venous return results in pulmonary venous hypertension and reduced cardiac output. This, however, can be compensated by an atrial septal defect allowing pulmonary venous return to the proximal chamber offloading into the right atrium. This, however, may also result in right-sided volume overload.

### • Pulmonary vein stenosis:

- a) the extent of pulmonary venous hypertension depends on the number of pulmonary veins involved and the degree of stenosis, which can vary from a discrete stenosis of an individual vein to generalised hypoplasia;
- b) bilateral pulmonary hypertensive arteriopathy may occur, even in the presence of unilateral pulmonary vein stenosis.

## 8 **What is the natural history of anomalous pulmonary venous connection?**

- Pulmonary venous anomalies may be an incidental finding following detection of a murmur and their haemodynamic effect, if any, depends on the number of anomalous venous connections or stenotic veins. Therefore, prognosis is influenced by the sequelae of arrhythmias, right heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.
- Uncorrected total anomalous pulmonary venous connection with pulmonary venous obstruction, however, results in death within the first month of life.
- Mortality of patients with three or four stenotic pulmonary veins may be over 80%, in comparison with 0% in patients with only one or two stenotic veins, which is due to a pulmonary hypertensive crisis, intercurrent pulmonary infection or haemoptysis.

### 9 **What are the symptoms of anomalous pulmonary venous connection?**

- Partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection:
  - a) symptoms depend on the extent of pulmonary venous involvement and the magnitude of the atrial level shunt;
  - b) most patients are usually asymptomatic;
  - c) dyspnoea and reduced exercise tolerance may occur in patients with right-sided volume overload;

- d) palpitations may occur due to arrhythmias associated with right atrial dilatation;
- e) haemoptysis may represent pulmonary vascular disease.
- Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection:
  - a) patients with pulmonary venous obstruction develop respiratory distress and cyanosis in early life;
  - b) patients without pulmonary venous obstruction may present with failure to thrive, reduced exercise tolerance and recurrent respiratory infections.
- Atresia of the common pulmonary vein:
  - a) cyanosis, respiratory distress and symptoms of congestive cardiac failure.
- Cor triatriatum:
  - a) failure to thrive and respiratory distress;
  - b) symptoms of pulmonary venous obstruction and palpitations may develop, secondary to atrial enlargement-induced arrhythmias.
- Pulmonary vein stenosis:
  - a) symptoms depend on the number of veins involved and the degree of stenosis;
  - b) respiratory distress and recurrent pneumonia may occur;
  - c) patients may develop symptoms of pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary oedema and haemoptysis.

### 10 **What are the signs of anomalous pulmonary venous connection?**

- Partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection:
  - a) symptoms depend on the extent of pulmonary venous involvement and the magnitude of the atrial level shunt;
  - b) clinical examination can be normal if only one pulmonary vein is involved;
  - c) parasternal heave, secondary to right ventricular and pulmonary artery dilatation;

- d) ejection systolic murmur over the pulmonary area, secondary to increased flow across the pulmonary valve and a widely split 2nd heart sound (usually with respiratory variation);
- e) a soft mid-diastolic murmur at the lower left sternal edge, secondary to increased flow across the tricuspid valve;
- f) signs of right-sided heart failure (including raised jugular venous pressure, peripheral oedema, hepatomegaly and ascites) and pulmonary hypertension (early diastolic murmur, absence of a systolic murmur, disappearance of the split 2nd heart sound and a mid-diastolic rumble) may develop.

### • Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection:

- a) patients with pulmonary venous obstruction develop cyanosis and respiratory distress, a prominent cardiac impulse and increased pulmonary component of the 2nd heart sound. They may have a systolic murmur over the pulmonary area and a murmur of tricuspid regurgitation over the left sternal edge;
- b) patients without pulmonary venous obstruction develop a right ventricular heave, widely split 2nd heart sound, systolic murmur over the pulmonary area and sometimes a diastolic tricuspid murmur;
- c) signs of pulmonary hypertension may also develop.

### • Cor triatriatum:

- a) signs of pulmonary venous obstruction and pulmonary hypertension;
- b) right ventricular heave and a loud pulmonary 2nd heart sound;
- c) there may be an early diastolic murmur of pulmonary regurgitation;
- d) a soft continuous murmur may also be present due to flow across the membrane;
- e) poor weight gain and signs of low cardiac output, such as pallor, tachypnoea and weak peripheral pulses, may be present.

### • Pulmonary vein stenosis:

- a) tachypnoea and signs of pneumonia;
- b) signs of pulmonary hypertension develop as the disease progresses.

### 11 **What are the electrocardiographic features of anomalous pulmonary venous connection?**

- An electrocardiogram may be normal or may reflect right atrial (enlarged P waves) or ventricular (rSR pattern in the chest leads) dilatation and right ventricular hypertrophy (right axis deviation, Figure 6).
- Associated arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or flutter and supraventricular tachycardia, may also be seen.

![](_page_11_Figure_5.jpeg)

**Figure 6. Electrocardiogram demonstrating a rSR pattern and right axis deviation, consistent with right ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy, in a patient with total anomalous pulmonary venous connection.**

## 12 **What are the radiological features of anomalous pulmonary venous connection?**

- Chest radiography may show evidence of:
  - a) cardiomegaly, secondary to right atrial and ventricular dilatation;
  - b) prominent hilum, secondary to pulmonary artery and left atrial enlargement;
  - c) widened mediastinum;
  - d) pulmonary oedema, demonstrated by Kerley B lines, increased pulmonary vascular markings, upper lobe diversion and pleural effusions;
  - e) Scimitar sign, demonstrated by a characteristic curvilinear opacity from the right lung to the inferior vena cava.

• Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can accurately define the anatomy of pulmonary venous anomalies and demonstrate the haemodynamic effects on the right heart and pulmonary circulation (Figure 7). In PAPVC, the broken ring sign signifies the breach of a ring of mediastinal fat around the superior vena cava by an anomalous pulmonary vein draining into it.

**549 Figure 7. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a patient with a sinus venosus defect demonstrating an enlarged right ventricle (RV) on axial short- and long-axis views. LV = left ventricle.**

• Computed tomography (CT) scanning can demonstrate the anatomy of pulmonary venous anomalies, particularly in older children or adults where transthoracic echocardiographic images may not be adequate.

### 13 **What are the echocardiographic features of anomalous pulmonary venous connection?**

- Two-dimensional echocardiography can be used to diagnose pulmonary venous anomalies (Figures and 10), assess pulmonary vein dimensions, identify the membrane in cor triatriatum and any associated defects, such as an atrial septal defect (Figure 11).
- It can also demonstrate the effects of pulmonary venous anomalies, including atrial dilatation (Figure 12), right ventricular and pulmonary artery volume loading, and tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation.
- Colour flow Doppler can be used to identify pulmonary vein stenosis, where monophasic flow or flow velocities >1.6m/s may suggest a

• Transoesophageal echocardiography may provide a more accurate assessment of pulmonary venous anomalies, particularly in obese adult patients where transthoracic images may not be adequate.

## 14 **What are the cardiac catheterisation features of anomalous pulmonary venous connection?**

- Routine cardiac catheterisation is not necessary in PAPVC. If performed, features may include normal right heart pressures in paediatric patients and higher oxygen saturations in the right atrium compared to the superior vena cava, which suggest anomalous pulmonary venous drainage to the right atrium in the absence of an atrial septal defect.
- Selective right and left pulmonary artery angiography also delineates the anatomy of the anomalous pulmonary venous connections.
- In cor triatriatum, cardiac catheterisation may show pulmonary hypertension without a left-to-right shunt, high pulmonary artery wedge pressures and normal left atrial pressures. Pulmonary artery angiography reveals an opacified pulmonary venous chamber draining into the left atrium.
- In pulmonary vein stenosis, there may be no antegrade flow of contrast dye through the veins and there may even be retrograde flow into arteries that drain into less stenotic veins. Nonoccluded veins may be visualised directly via transseptal catheterisation.

## 15 **Describe the pulmonary vein stenosis score (Table 1)**

• Each vein is evaluated on 2D echocardiographic images and colour Doppler assessment of the pressure gradient (mmHg) across the veno-atrial junction. This is correlated with macroscopic operative findings, including measurement of the pulmonary vein diameter (mm).

## 16 What are the therapeutic options for patients with anomalous pulmonary venous connection?

- Medical management of arrhythmias and right heart failure:
  - a) for TAPVC with pulmonary venous obstruction, treatment includes sedation, ventilation or hyperventilation with 100% oxygen (with pCO<sub>2</sub> levels maintained <30mmHg); administration of prostaglandin E<sub>1</sub> to maintain a patent ductus arteriosus; aggressive correction of systemic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate; and optimisation of haematocrit;
  - for TAPVC without pulmonary venous obstruction, treatment of right ventricular failure, hypoxia, and congestive heart failure includes mild inotropic support, diuresis and low levels of inspired oxygen.

#### Percutaneous intervention:

- a) atrial septostomy may be used in patients with TAPVC and a restrictive foramen ovale, where definitive surgical repair is delayed;
- b) stenting of an obstructed vertical vein prior to surgery for TAPVC is possible;

- c) balloon dilatation of the membrane between the pulmonary veins and mitral valve in cor triatriatum has been reported;
- balloon dilatation or stenting of stenotic pulmonary veins usually results in restenosis and stenting may limit the possibility of a future surgical correction.
- Surgery.

## 17 What are the indications for surgery for anomalous pulmonary venous connection?

- Partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection:
  - all patients with PAPVC may be appropriate for surgical repair due to the low associated morbidity and mortality;
  - b) otherwise, once Qp:Qs ≥2 or if an entire lung drains anomalously.
- Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection:
  - a) obstructed TAPVC is a medical emergency that requires surgical correction for definitive treatment;
  - medical optimisation prior to surgery involves intubation, hyperventilation with 100% oxygen, prostaglandin infusion, aggressive correction of acidosis and metabolic dysfunction and inotropic support;
  - c) elective surgery for unobstructed TAPVC can be performed at months of age.

## 18 What are the contraindications for surgery for anomalous pulmonary venous connection?

- There are no specific contraindications for repair of TAPVC.
- The surgical risk in patients with PAPVC and fixed pulmonary hypertension may preclude surgery.
- Closure of an atrial septal defect in patients with PAPVC may not be suitable where the pulmonary pressure is more than two thirds of systemic pressure.

## 19 What structures are at risk during surgical repair of anomalous pulmonary venous connection?

- Conduction system.
- Sinoatrial node and its artery.
- Left phrenic nerve.

## 20 What are the principles of surgery for a patient with a partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection?

- Median sternotomy.
- The cannulation site for venous drainage of the upper extremities is determined by the position of the anomalous pulmonary veins, with the superior vena cava or innominate vein usually selected.
- Cardioplegic arrest and systemic normothermia.
- Right atriotomy.
- Techniques include:
  - a) glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardial patch which is used to create a baffle to redirect the anomalous pulmonary veins to the left atrium and close any associated atrial septal defect, using either a double-patch technique (Figures 15 and 16) or a single-patch technique;

anomalous pulmonary veins to the atrial septal defect and left atrium.

• Atrial fibrillation ablation surgery (MAZE procedure) as an adjunct.

## 21 **What are the principles of surgery for <sup>a</sup> patient with total anomalous pulmonary venous connection?**

## • Supracardiac TAPVC:

- a) the vertical vein is usually ligated next to its connection to the systemic vein;
- b) access to the pulmonary venous confluence is achieved either via the posterior pericardium by retracting the heart to the right and anteriorly; by a superior approach between the ascending aorta and superior vena cava; or in the right pericardial fossa by a vertical incision through the right atrium, interatrial septum and left atrium;
- c) an incision is created in the pulmonary venous confluence to match a corresponding incision in the posterior wall of the left atrium and extending into the left atrial appendage;
- d) the pulmonary confluence is anastomosed to the left atrium with fine sutures to minimise intimal hyperplasia and potential restenosis;
- e) the aim is to achieve a large, unobstructed anastomosis;
- f) although deep hypothermic arrest is rarely necessary, a short period of low-flow cardiopulmonary bypass may be desirable for a meticulous anastomosis.

### • Cardiac TAPVC:

- a) the coronary sinus is unroofed through an incision between the coronary sinus and the fossa ovalis, thus creating a large atrial septal defect;
- b) the pulmonary vein ostia are visualised through the coronary sinus and its connection with the confluence;
- c) a patch is used to reconstruct the atrial septum, leaving the pulmonary venous drainage to flow through the unroofed coronary sinus into the left atrium;
- d) when the anomalous veins drain directly into the right atrium, the interatrial septum is detached posteriorly and reattached to the right of the right-sided pulmonary vein ostia.

### • Infracardiac TAPVC (Figure 18):

- a) the technique is similar to that described for supracardiac TAPVC;
- b) the pulmonary venous confluence tends to be oriented vertically, typically in a Y-shape and is extrapericardial. As a consequence, the incision into the left atrium is relatively vertical or Y-shaped;
- c) some surgeons do not ligate the vertical vein to provide access to a low-pressure system in cases of a particularly small and restrictive left atrium. Others ligate the connecting vein immediately above the diaphragm and use the intrapericardial portion of this vein to produce a larger anastomosis.

### • Mixed TAPVC:

- a) surgical correction of mixed TAPVC depends on the exact anatomy and site of the pulmonary venous connections;
- b) a combination of the aforementioned procedures is usually required to completely redirect pulmonary venous blood to the left atrium;
- c) a possible alternative is represented by the use of a sutureless technique to treat the complex patterns of connections in this subgroup, where the pericardium around the pulmonary veins is anastomosed to the left atrium thus avoiding direct suture of the pulmonary veins (Figure 19). Using this technique may reduce the incidence of postoperative pulmonary vein stenosis.

## 22 What are the surgical options for a patient with pulmonary vein stenosis?

- Sutureless technique (Figure 20) which involves complete resection of the stenotic segments. Following incision of the veins proximally into their intraparenchymal portions, the atrial wall is directly anastomosed to the pericardium.
- Atrial pulmonary venoplasty.
- Pericardial patch pulmonary venoplasty.
- Anastomotic revision or scar excision with primary repair for acquired stenosis.
- Pneumonectomy has been advocated for patients with unilateral pulmonary vein stenosis and haemoptysis or recurrent pulmonary infection but not in those with congestive cardiac failure.

## 23 What are the complications of surgery following repair of anomalous pulmonary venous connection?

- Bleeding.
- Thromboembolism.
- Atrial arrhythmias.
- Congestive cardiac failure.

- Pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction.
- Recurrent pulmonary vein stenosis.
- Atrioventricular block and requirement of a permanent pacemaker.
- Death.

## 24 What are the long-term outcomes of surgery?

- Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection:
  - a) hospital mortality ranges from 2-20%;
  - risk factors include poor pre-operative status, obstruction, high pulmonary vascular resistance, young age, small left ventricle and single-ventricle anatomy;
  - c) long-term prognosis is favourable;
  - d) pulmonary venous obstruction may arise in as many as 15% of patients after repair, usually due to obstruction at the site of anastomosis. Repeat surgery in these cases produces generally favourable results;
  - e) in some patients, this process may progress to almost complete vein occlusion;
  - f) when the lesion is bilateral, the prognosis is poor.
- Partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection:
  - a) the long-term prognosis is excellent;
  - b) early closure of an atrial septal defect almost eliminates the risk of atrial arrhythmias;
  - c) pre-operative arrhythmias beget persistent arrhythmias and mortality;
  - d) patients should also be followed up for evidence of stenosis at the site of pulmonary venous repair;
  - e) the diffuse stenosis described after repair of TAPVC is rare.
- Scimitar partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection:
  - a) the long-term prognosis is better than pulmonary vein stenosis and when successful, repair offers excellent survival rates;
  - b) survival depends on the severity of associated lesions, such as lung hypoplasia and airways problems;
  - c) restenosis rates are higher than in PAPVC, ranging from 3% to 10%.

### • Pulmonary vein stenosis:

a) this is a serious condition with a high mortality due to progression of pulmonary vein stenosis and pulmonary hypertension, and few surgical options.
