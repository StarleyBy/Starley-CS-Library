### Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries

**Raghav Murthy, Kelly Rosso, Eric Devaney**

- 1 **What is congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries?**
- Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA) is a complex congenital heart defect characterised by both atrioventricular and ventriculo-arterial discordance, where the:
  - a) systemic venous blood returns to the morphological right atrium that is connected via a mitral valve to the morphological left ventricle (LV), which is connected to the pulmonary artery; and

**Figure 1. A) Normal heart with atrioventricular and ventriculo-arterial concordance. B) Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries with atrioventricular and ventriculo-arterial discordance. Ao = aorta; PA = pulmonary artery; RA = right atrium; LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle; RV = right ventricle.**

- b) pulmonary venous blood returns to the morphological left atrium that is connected via a tricuspid valve to the morphological right ventricle (RV), which is connected to the aorta.
- This results in a 'corrected' and physiologically 'normal' circulation, which remains in series (Figure 1).
- Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries represents less than 1% of all congenital cardiac lesions.

#### 2 **Describe the segmental anatomy of congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries**

- Situs solitus is present in 90% of cases with ccTGA (Figure 2), where the segmental anatomy is S,L,L:
  - a) situs solitus (S);
  - b) ventricular loop left (L);
  - c) position of the aorta to the left (L).

A ventricular septal defect is also present.

- In the remaining 10%, the situs is inverted and usually associated with dextrocardia (Figure 3). The segmental anatomy is I,D,D:
  - a) situs inversus (I);
  - b) ventricular loop dexterus (D);
  - c) position of the aorta to the right (D).

- 3 **Describe the congenital defects that are associated with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries**
- Associated anomalies (often more than one) are present in 98% of the cases of ccTGA and are the major determining factors in symptom progression and surgical management. They include:
  - a) ventricular septal defect (VSD) 75%;
  - b) pulmonary stenosis or atresia, including subpulmonary stenosis — 50% (Figure 4);
  - c) tricuspid valve abnormalities, often in the spectrum of Ebstein's malformation (Ebstenoid valve) — 50% (Figure 5);
  - d) straddling of the mitral or tricuspid valve across the VSD;
  - e) spontaneous heart block.

#### 4 **Describe the location of the conduction system in congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries**

• In situs solitus, the conduction system is abnormally located due to the looping pattern (Figure 6). The AV node is displaced superiorly and located anteriorly on the atrial septum, near the junction of the superior limbus of the atrial septum and the mitral valve. The bundle of His leaves the AV node and travels anteriorly towards the pulmonary valve. The bundle then travels in the subendocardium of the morphological LV.

**Figure 6. Conduction system in a patient with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries: A) right atriotomy view of the exposed mitral valve, which can be retracted to reveal the ventricular septal defect (VSD), which is usually in a perimembranous location. The atrioventricular (AV) node is displaced clockwise within the triangle of Koch, with the bundle of His passing anterior to the pulmonary annulus and along the morphological left ventricular side of the crest of the ventricular septum; B) the bundle of His courses in a superoinferior trajectory along the leftward margin of the VSD. RA = right atrium; PA = pulmonary artery; Ao = aorta; LA = left atrium; RV = right ventricle; LV = left ventricle.**

• In situs inversus, the anatomy of the conduction system is that of a normal heart but with a mirror image pattern.

#### 5 **What is the pathophysiology of congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries?**

- In the absence of associated anomalies, the physiology in ccTGA is normal but the primary concern stems from the identity of the morphological right ventricle as the systemic ventricle and the tricuspid valve as the systemic atrioventricular valve. The morbidity and mortality associated with this lesion results from long-term failure of this systemic RV and/or tricuspid regurgitation.
- Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) may be secondary to anatomical malformation (Ebsteinoid) or progressive annular dilatation associated with RV failure.
- A large contributing factor to the malfunction of the systemic valve and ventricle is the shift of the ventricular septum towards the morphological LV with progressive failure and dilatation, which causes the septal leaflet to splay open the tricuspid valve. This process can be reversed in some cases with pulmonary artery banding, which pressurises the left ventricle and shifts the septum back towards a midline position, thereby improving leaflet coaptation.
- Patients with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) from pulmonary stenosis or pulmonary atresia will present early in life with cyanosis.
- Patients with significant TR or a large VSD present with heart failure.
- Bradycardia secondary to spontaneous heart block contributes to heart failure symptoms. The incidence of heart block is approximately 2% per year following diagnosis of ccTGA.

#### 6 **Describe the chest radiographical findings in <sup>a</sup> patient with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries**

- Chest radiography reveals parallel great vessels.
- The upper left heart border is formed by the aorta and appears straight, whereas the pulmonary artery knuckle is absent because of the rightward, posterior displacement of the artery (Figure 7).

**Figure 7. Chest radiograph in a patient with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries demonstrating a straight left border with an absent pulmonary knuckle.**

- 7 **Describe the electrocardiographic findings in <sup>a</sup> patient with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries**
- Electrocardiography is affected by the associated cardiac anomalies but commonly shows atrioventricular block, atrial arrhythmias and abnormal initial ventricular activation due to abnormal conduction system anatomy.
- Ventricular inversion, where the ventricular bundle branches are inverted and the initial activation is orientated from right to left, is identified by reversal of the normal Q-wave pattern in the praecordial leads, such that Q waves are present in the right praecordial leads but absent in the left praecordial leads (Figure 8).
- Complete atrioventricular block is not uncommon, including in the neonatal or infancy period (Figure 9).

#### 8 **Describe the echocardiographic findings in <sup>a</sup> patient with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries**

• Echocardiography is the mainstay of diagnosis (Figure 10) and allows complete assessment of the lesion and its associated malformations, thereby informing surgical planning (as required) and long-term follow-up.

![](_page_8_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 10. Transthoracic echocardiographic image in a patient with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries demonstrating atrioventricular discordance.**

#### • The assessment should include:

- a) standard sequential analysis of anatomy, including situs, ventricular looping and position of the great vessels;
- b) anatomy and function of the atrioventricular valves, especially in the systemic position;
- c) identification of any left ventricular outflow tract obstruction;
- d) size and location of any VSD (Figure 11);
- e) presence of straddling of the atrioventricular valves, if a VSD is seen.

- 9 **What are the principles of managing <sup>a</sup> patient with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries?**
- Surgical intervention is reserved for symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients with evidence of declining RV function and worsening tricuspid regurgitation (Figure 12).
- Intervention on asymptomatic patients with preserved RV function and tricuspid valve function without any other septal defects is controversial considering that some patients with ccTGA tend to have a favourable prognosis and surgical intervention is associated with risks and long-term issues.
- 10 **What are the surgical options for <sup>a</sup> patient with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries?**
- Physiological repair which was the traditional approach that left the RV as the systemic ventricle and the TV as the systemic AV valve but addressed any associated anomalies, such as VSD closure, tricuspid valve repair or replacement and placement of a LV to PA conduit to bypass the LVOTO. Unsurprisingly, this approach was associated with significant long-term morbidity and mortality.

• Anatomical repair — which is more commonly used in contemporary practice, involves restoring the LV as the systemic ventricle and the mitral valve as the systemic atrioventricular valve, using a:

- a) double-switch operation (combined atrial and arterial switch) — in the absence of LVOTO;
- b) atrial switch combined with a Rastelli operation in the presence of a VSD and LVOTO.

#### 11 **What are the palliative interventions that may be required during the neonatal period?**

• Severe subpulmonary stenosis or atresia may result in a ductdependent state requiring an arterial to PA shunt, most commonly with a modified Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt (Figure 13).

**Figure 13. Modified Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt for a patient with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, associated with pulmonary atresia and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.**

- The presence of a large VSD may result in congestive heart failure requiring PA banding in infancy to regulate pulmonary blood flow (Figure 14).
- Occasionally, complete heart block develops in utero and the child is born with a slow ventricular escape rhythm and poor ventricular function, often necessitating placement of a dual-chamber pacemaker in the neonatal period (Figure 15).

#### 12 **What are the principles of ventricular septal defect repair in a patient with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (Figure 16)?**

- Following distal ascending aortic and bicaval cannulation with cardioplegic arrest, a standard right atriotomy is performed with exposure of the VSD by retraction of the mitral valve leaflets.
- During this repair, it is important to avoid the conduction tissue, which is located along the anterior and superior margin of the defect in the subendocardium of the morphological LV.
- In view of this, the autologous pericardial patch is implanted with the superior sutures placed on the RV side of the ventricular septum and the inferior sutures placed on the LV side of the ventricular septum.

**Figure 16. Suture placement for ventricular septal defect (VSD) closure in a patient with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries. In order to avoid the conduction system (red dot and dotted line), which is located at the superior aspect of the VSD, the superior sutures are placed on the right ventricular (RV) side of the ventricular septum and the inferior sutures are placed on the left ventricular (LV) side of the ventricular septum. PA = pulmonary artery; Ao = aorta; AV node = atrioventricular node.**

#### 13 **What are the principles of left ventricular outflow tract repair in a patient with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (Figure 17)?**

- The level of obstruction may be valvular, subvalvular or both, but as this usually is not repairable, the outflow tract requires bypass with a conduit.
- A ventriculotomy is performed on the morphological LV, taking care not to injure the coronary arteries or the mitral apparatus, and the VSD is closed using a patch followed by implanting a LV to PA conduit.
- The VSD can also be accessed using an atrial approach.

**773 Figure 17. Physiological repair of a patient with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction: A) following an anterior left ventriculotomy, the ventricular septal defect (VSD) is closed with a patch using sutures placed on the morphological right ventricular (RV) side of the septum in the area of conduction tissue to avoid heart block; B) a valved conduit is then implanted between the left ventricle (LV) and the pulmonary artery (PA) while the native pulmonary valve is oversewn. When an allograft is used, a patch extension in the form of a 'gusset' is frequently utilised to allow for a better fit. Ao = aorta; RA = right atrium.**

#### 14 **What are the principles of tricuspid valve surgery in <sup>a</sup> patient with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries?**

- As this is analogous to performing a mitral valve procedure in a normal heart, the interatrial groove is dissected widely and the left atrium is entered.
- In some patients, exposure may be limited due to the looping, necessitating transection of the superior vena cava.
- Although valvuloplasty may be an option, repair of an Ebstenoid valve can be very difficult and replacement is usually required.

#### 15 Describe the principles of left ventricular training

- Anatomical repair places the LV as the systemic ventricle.
- Patients with LVOTO or a large VSD are very good candidates for this approach, as the LV is exposed to systemic pressure and prepared to handle the systemic circulation after the operation.
- Conversely, however, patients with an intact septum require a period of LV training prior to an anatomical repair, to develop LV hypertrophy.
- This is accomplished by placing a pulmonary artery band, with the goal to obtain at least 50% of the systemic pressure in the LV at the time of band placement. This is often associated with a shift of the septum towards the morphological RV, which can produce an improvement in tricuspid regurgitation that is often present, by allowing better leaflet coaptation.
- Repeat PA band tightening is required until the LV pressure is equal or exceeds 80% of systemic pressure. The LV is adequately prepared at this time to sustain an anatomical repair and handle the systemic circulation.

## 16 What are the surgical options for the atrial switch component of the double-switch operation?

- Senning procedure which is the preferred choice by many surgeons.
- Mustard procedure.
- Hemi-Mustard/Glenn procedure which eliminates superior vena caval baffle obstruction but limits future placement of a transvenous pacemaker.

### 17 What are the principles of performing a double-switch (Senning procedure plus arterial switch) operation?

- Although this can be performed in a neonate, it is usually deferred to months of age due to the complexity of the operation.
- Following bicaval cannulation with distal SVC cannulation, moderate hypothermia and cardioplegic arrest, autologous pericardium is harvested and treated with glutaraldehyde for later use.
- The Senning atrial switch procedure involves widely developing the interatrial groove, followed by a right and left atriotomy. The atrial septum is developed into a flap and sutured as a baffle to redirect the pulmonary venous blood (Figure 18).
- The venous pathway is completed by folding over the lateral right atrial tissue over the caval orifices, which allows the caval blood to flow across the mitral valve and the pulmonary venous blood to the tricuspid valve.

**Figure 18. Senning procedure in a patient with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries: A) a right atriotomy is performed. The location of the atriotomy is not critical as the pulmonary venous pathway will be augmented with a patch; B) the atrial septum is mobilised on a lateral (posterior) pedicle. Alternatively, the atrial septum can be completely excised and a Gore-Tex® membrane can be used to reconstruct the atrial septum; C) the atrial septum is sutured to the floor of the left atrium around the pulmonary veins and then a longitudinal left atriotomy is made; D) the posterior edge of the right atriotomy is folded into the right atrium and sewn along the inner atrial wall and along the divided edge of the atrial septum. This creates the systemic venous pathway and redirects the systemic venous blood along the atrial septum into the tricuspid valve. The pulmonary venous pathway is augmented using a patch that is sewn posteriorly to the lateral edge of the left atriotomy; E) the patch is then sewn along the outer wall of the right atrium to connect with the anterior edge of the original right atriotomy.**

- Patch augmentation of the atriotomy is performed to complete the pulmonary venous pathway. The arterial switch is performed in a standard manner as employed for dextro-transposition of the great arteries (Figure 19).
- Neopulmonary sinuses are constructed using the previously harvested pericardium.

**Figure 19. Arterial switch procedure in the anatomical repair of congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries: A) the pulmonary artery is transected at its bifurcation and the aorta is divided just above the origin of the coronary arteries. Note the morphological left coronary artery which perfuses the morphological right ventricle arising from the right facing sinus and the morphological right coronary artery perfuses the morphological left ventricle, from the left; B) the Lecompte manoeuvre is performed and the neo-aortic anastomosis completed; C) the coronary buttons are mobilised for coronary transfer; D) the coronary buttons are transferred to the respective sinuses in the neo-aorta; E) anastomosis of the coronary button to the neo-aortic root; F) occasionally, a trapdoor technique is performed using a pericardial patch, if tension or distortion is likely to occur; G) the neopulmonary sinuses are reconstructed using an autologous pericardial patch; H) in order to avoid distortion, the orifice of the pulmonary bifurcation is shifted to the left with the right lateral surface augmented with a patch.**

#### 18 **What are the principles of <sup>a</sup> Senning/Rastelli procedure?**

- This is performed for patients with a significant unresectable LVOTO or pulmonary artresia, where the arterial switch operation is not an option.
- In patients with significant cyanosis, an initial palliative shunt procedure is performed in the early postnatal period.
- Definitive surgical correction is usually performed at months of age.
- The Senning procedure is performed as previously described.
- A right ventriculotomy is performed and the VSD patched with a baffle to redirect the blood from the LV to the aorta.
- An RV to PA conduit is then placed (Figure 20).

**Figure 20. Rastelli procedure in the anatomical repair of congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries: A) the right ventriculotomy is performed with the apex of the heart elevated, and an intraventricular baffle is created using a patch connecting the ventricular septal defect with the aorta (red asterisk); B) a valved conduit is implanted between the right ventriculotomy and the pulmonary artery bifurcation. PA = pulmonary artery; Ao = aorta; RV = right ventricle; RA = right atrium; LV = left ventricle.**

### 19 What are the outcomes following a traditional physiological repair?

- Although historically the mortality was as high as 26%, currently it is reported as 3%.
- Overall survival is approximately 77% at 5 years, 67% at 10 years and 48% at 20 years.
- The recurrence of tricuspid regurgitation after repair is about 50%.
- The incidence of post-surgical heart block is 20%.
- Systemic ventricular failure accounts for about 50% of the late deaths.

#### 20 What are the outcomes following an anatomical repair?

- The early mortality following anatomical repair is approximately 6%, with a 9-year survival >90%.
- LV retraining is required in about 31% of patients.
- Tricuspid regurgitation, when present, significantly improves after anatomical repair.

### 21 What are the late complications that may occur following anatomical repair?

- RV to PA conduit dysfunction, requiring replacement.
- Systemic venous pathway obstruction (Figure 21).
