### Heart and lung transplantation

**Timothy S. Lancaster, Jacob R. Miller, Pirooz Eghtesady**

#### *Heart transplantation*

- 1 **What are the most common diagnoses and indications for paediatric heart transplantation?**
- The most common diagnoses in children undergoing heart transplantation include congenital heart disease and cardiomyopathy, with a small fraction of children undergoing retransplantation.
- Congenital heart disease has historically been the predominant diagnosis for infants undergoing transplantation (70-80% in the 1980s and 90s); however, this has decreased to about 50% of infant recipients in current years.
- With increasing age, the overall contribution of patients with congenital heart disease requiring transplantation decreases steadily, such that by adolescent age the majority (~65%) of transplants are done for some form of cardiomyopathy.
- Common clinical indications for paediatric heart transplantation include:
  - a) dependence on intravenous inotropic or mechanical circulatory support;
  - b) complex congenital heart disease not amenable to conventional surgical repair or palliation, or for which the surgical procedure carries a higher risk of mortality than transplantation;
  - c) progressive deterioration of ventricular function or functional status despite optimal medical care;
  - d) survival of cardiac arrest or malignant arrhythmia unresponsive to medical treatment, catheter ablation or an automatic implantable defibrillator;
  - e) progressive pulmonary hypertension that could preclude cardiac transplantation at a later date;
  - f) growth failure secondary to severe congestive heart failure unresponsive to medical treatment;

- g) unacceptably poor quality of life resulting from heart failure.
- Indications for heart retransplantation include:
  - a) hyperacute rejection;
  - b) acute primary graft failure;
  - c) late graft failure from cardiac allograft vasculopathy.

#### 2 **What are the contraindications to heart transplantation?**

- In general, any non-cardiac condition that significantly shortens the patient's expected survival compared to the survival expected after transplantation. Importantly, the expected effect of immunosuppressive requirements on coexisting conditions should be taken into account.
- Specific contraindications include active infection, recent active neoplasm, active ulcer disease, renal failure (unless renal transplant is planned), liver dysfunction, non-reactive pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolism, recreational drug use and medical nonadherence.

#### 3 **What are the principles of medical management for children with cardiac failure awaiting transplantation?**

- The medical management of chronic heart failure in children includes pharmacologic treatment with diuretics, afterload reduction (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers), beta-blockers (metoprolol, carvedilol) and oral inotropes (digoxin). Neprilysin inhibitors, the first of which was recently approved in combination with an angiotensin receptor blocker (sacubitril/valsartan), are showing great promise as a nextgeneration medical therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.
- The management of acute decompensated heart failure is based on the primary clinical presentation:
  - a) patients with volume overload or congestion but adequate tissue perfusion are managed primarily with diuretics and vasodilators to optimise volume status and forward ejection fraction;
  - b) patients with cardiogenic shock (inadequate tissue perfusion) are often initially managed with afterload reduction, with inotropes being reserved for those patients who remain

decompensated with clinical evidence of poor cardiac output. Milrinone, dobutamine, and epinephrine are examples of inotropes used in acute paediatric heart failure.

• Mechanical circulatory support (MCS), including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and ventricular assist devices (VADs), should be considered in patients with a failing myocardium and increasing inotropic requirements.

#### 4 **Describe the evaluation of <sup>a</sup> heart transplant candidate**

- The goal of transplant recipient evaluation is to identify patients who are likely to benefit from transplantation and achieve long-term survival.
- This involves a thorough cardiac and medical evaluation, as well as identification of any social or financial barriers to the success of transplantation and long-term maintenance care.
- Cardiac evaluation includes electrocardiography, echocardiography and often cardiac catheterisation. Specific anatomical and haemodynamic details that may have implications for operative decision-making or technique should be investigated, including systemic and pulmonary venous anomalies and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Additional imaging, including computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be helpful in specific circumstances.
- Medical evaluation consists of comprehensive laboratory evaluation, including panel reactive antibody (PRA) testing for antibodies against human leukocyte antigens (HLA).

#### 5 **What considerations need to be taken into account for candidates with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance?**

- The level of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and its response to pulmonary vasodilators is considered during heart transplantation evaluation.
- A diagnosis of elevated PVR does not automatically exclude a patient from heart-only transplantation, and there is usually less risk in transplanting paediatric patients with an elevated PVR than in patients listed for adult heart transplantation.
- In general, patients with reactive PVR (responsive to nitric oxide or other pulmonary vasodilators) can be safely transplanted as long as

PVR adjusted for BSA is <5-6 Woods units. These patients may display some degree of right heart failure and evidence of a stiff heart (diastolic dysfunction with elevated CVP) postoperatively, which requires higher filling pressures.

- In recent years, a strategy of left ventricle (LV) unloading with a ventricular assist device prior to transplant has been found to reverse elevated PVR in many patients with a relatively short duration of pulmonary hypertension (<1-2 years).
- Additionally, the use of oversized donor grafts may help to mitigate the risk of graft right ventricle (RV) failure.
- Patients with uncorrectable, complex congenital heart disease with pulmonary hypertension (Eisenmenger syndrome) and poor LV function, as well as patients with non-reactive, fixed pulmonary hypertension due to other forms of cardiomyopathy, may be considered for heart-lung transplantation.

#### 6 **Describe the principles of evaluation of <sup>a</sup> heart transplant donor**

- Evaluation of a heart transplant donor and selection of a matching recipient is based on several factors, including donor size and age, immunologic matching, distance from the recipient institution, cardiac function and donor infectious history.
- Controversy remains regarding optimal donor to recipient size matching in paediatric heart transplantation, with some centres advocating for oversizing paediatric heart donors up to a ratio of 3:1 or greater.
- This approach may increase the available donor pool for infants and young children, and may also provide a decreased risk of graft RV failure in recipients with pulmonary hypertension. In contrast, increased rates of graft failure have been demonstrated with significantly undersized donor hearts. The use of excessively large graft hearts can, however, cause compression of adjacent structures and pose challenges at the time of chest closure.

#### 7 **Describe the principles of organ allocation in paediatric heart transplantation**

- Organ allocation in the United States is overseen by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN).
- As in adult heart transplantation, paediatric patients are listed as Status 1A, 1B or 2 according to medical urgency. Matching is then

- performed based on urgency status, immunologic and donorrecipient size matching, and geographical distance between the donor and recipient.
- Status 1A is the highest urgency listing group, and is assigned to children meeting one of the following criteria:
  - a) requires assistance of a mechanical ventilator;
  - b) requires assistance of a mechanical assist device;
  - c) requires assistance of a balloon pump;
  - d) <6 months old with congenital or acquired heart disease exhibiting reactive pulmonary hypertension >50% of systemic level (the child may be treated with prostaglandin E1 to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus);
  - e) requires infusion of a single high-dose inotrope or multiple intravenous inotropes;
  - f) life expectancy without a heart transplant <14 days.
- Status 1B is assigned to children meeting one of the following criteria:
  - a) requires an infusion of a low-dose single inotrope;
  - b) <6 months old and does not meet the criteria for paediatric Status 1A;
  - c) <5th percentile for the candidate's expected height or weight;
  - d) ≥1.5 standard deviations below expected height or weight growth.
- Status 2 applies to all children under age 18 who do not meet Status 1A or 1B criteria but are suitable for transplant.
- Inactive status applies to children who are temporarily unsuitable for transplant but may be reactivated at a later date.

#### 8 **What are the typical waiting times for infants, children and adolescents listed for heart transplant?**

- The median waiting time for paediatric patients undergoing heart transplant is approximately 30 days, although there is wide variability in this number based on the patient's age, medical urgency or status, numbers delisted, or mortality while waiting.
- Approximately 10% of children unfortunately die while waiting for a transplant, with higher waitlist mortality rates for children <1 year of age and patients with congenital heart disease.

#### 9 **What is ABO-incompatible transplantation?**

- ABO-incompatible transplantation is the implantation of an organ from a donor with an incompatible blood type.
- This method of transplantation can generally be used for infants <12 months of age because isoagglutinin production typically remains absent until this age.
- Isoagglutinin titers refer to natural antibody concentrations that exist in the sera of all individuals. These antibodies are specifically directed at carbohydrate residues of red blood cell antigen groups. For example, patients with blood Type A have natural anti-B antibodies to blood from Type B donors.
- Isolated reports of ABO-incompatible transplantation at a slightly older age have also been reported in the setting of low isoagglutinin titers.
- ABO-incompatible transplantation has only partially improved waitlist mortality and waiting time.
- ABO-incompatible transplantation was introduced in 2001 with the goal of reducing waitlist mortality for infants, which is higher than for other age groups due to limitations in the number of appropriately sized donor organs.
- Although broad adoption of ABO-incompatible transplantation for infants has resulted in marked reduction in waitlist mortality and waiting time in Europe and Canada, in the United States, ABOincompatible matches are usually only allocated to the sickest infants or after no ABO-compatible matches can be made.
- For example, a heart from a blood Type A donor may be matched to a blood Type B baby listed for ABO-incompatible transplant only after babies with blood Type A have been passed on the waiting list. Recent modifications to allocation policies, however, may broaden the use of ABO-incompatible transplantation in the United States.

#### 10 **What is the role of mechanical circulatory support as <sup>a</sup> bridge to paediatric heart transplantation?**

- Mechanical circulatory support has come to play an important role in paediatric patients awaiting transplant with the most severe heart failure.
- The utilisation of MCS has increased dramatically, resulting in increased survival on the waiting list for the sickest of patients.
- Currently, approximately 20% of patients who undergo transplant are bridged with a ventricular assist device or total artificial heart.
- Multiple device types are currently available, each with their own unique advantages and disadvantages.

- Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation provides short-term support to patients with single- or bi-ventricular cardiac failure and/or pulmonary failure. It can be used to support patients of all ages and can be instituted quickly, even peripherally and with ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
- The risk of complications with ECMO, including bleeding and thromboembolic events, however, becomes quite high with durations of support exceeding weeks. Furthermore, in a veno-arterial configuration, it often requires patients to be sedated and immobile during support, therefore promoting debilitation.
- Short-term VADs, such as Medtronic Bio-Pump™, Thoratec PediMag® and CentriMag®, are similar to ECMO in many ways. They do not include an oxygenator, however, and have the advantage of a simpler circuit with shorter tubing length, therefore requiring less maintenance and smaller priming volumes. The drawbacks of limited support duration and patient immobility remain with these devices.
- Durable VADs have become increasingly prevalent in paediatric patients since the approval of the Berlin Heart EXCOR® Pediatric VAD, a pneumatically-driven pulsatile-flow device, by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011 (Figure 1).

**Figure 1. The Berlin Heart EXCOR® paediatric ventricular assist device offers pumps to accommodate paediatric patients of any age.** *Reproduced with permission from Berlin Heart Inc.*

- In the first prospective paediatric VAD trial in the world, superior survival was found in patients supported with the Berlin Heart VAD (90%), as compared to ECMO (40-60%), as well as decreased complication rates. The Berlin Heart VAD can be used for long-term support of one or both ventricles in children of all ages, and allows patients to be ambulatory and receive rehabilitation while awaiting transplant.
- The use of several adult continuous-flow VADs, such as HeartWare HVAD™ and Thoratec Heart-Mate II™, has also been described in the paediatric population. These devices may be preferred in larger children, in whom a fully implantable device allows increased mobility, rehabilitation and even hospital discharge. Most centres will consider a continuous-flow device in patients with a BSA >1.0m2, with some reports in patients as small as 0.7m2.
- Single-ventricle patients pose a unique challenge when considering MCS. Both ECMO and VADs can be utilised to support the failing single ventricle. The use of a biventricular assist device (BiVAD) configuration has also been described in single-ventricle patients with Fontan physiology and elevated pulmonary pressures, which could limit filling of a systemic VAD alone.
- Currently in development, a cavopulmonary assist device ("Fontan pump") could function similarly to a short-term VAD to provide partial support to the pulmonary circulation in patients with failing Fontan physiology prior to heart transplant.

#### 11 **What are the principles of surgery for paediatric heart transplantation?**

- Although the biatrial technique is still performed at some centres, the bicaval left atrial cuff technique is most commonly performed for noninfant paediatric heart transplantation.
- The patient is placed on cardiopulmonary bypass with aortic and bicaval cannulation prior to aortic cross-clamping and cardiectomy, during which large left atrial, inferior vena cava (IVC) and superior vena cava (SVC) cuffs are created.
- Implantation is performed by completion of the left atrial and aortic anastomoses first, after which the cross-clamp is removed and the heart is reperfused.
- The IVC, SVC, and pulmonary artery (PA) anastomoses are then completed in sequence, with care being taken to ensure the SVC and PA anastomoses are tension-free and properly aligned, especially in young children.

#### 12 **Which special technical factors need to be considered when performing transplantation in children with congenital heart disease?**

- While intracardiac congenital malformations are alleviated by replacement with the donor organ, a variety of extracardiac congenital or acquired malformations may require modification of the standard surgical technique for transplantation. These include anomalies of the systemic and pulmonary venous return, great arteries and atrial situs, as well as iatrogenic consequences of previous palliative procedures.
- The presence of a left superior vena cava (LSVC) is the most common anomaly of systemic venous return requiring reconstruction during transplantation. The LSVC may often be ligated if a bridging or innominate vein exists to the right atrium. If no bridging vein exists, the left systemic venous return must be rerouted to the donor right atrium (RA), using donor innominate vein, other conduit from the LSVC or by creation of an intra-atrial baffle. The native left pulmonary artery can also be used to extend the LSVC to the donor right atrium or RSVC. If the LSVC drains to the coronary sinus via a roofed pathway, this native connection should be preserved during recipient cardiectomy, allowing either a biatrial or bicaval implantation. In some situations, a left-sided Glenn (LSVC to pulmonary artery) connection may be left intact, or even created, if other reconstruction is not feasible.
- Malposition of the great arteries is most commonly seen during transplantation in patients with transposition of the great arteries, either uncorrected or in adult patients who have undergone a previous Mustard or Senning procedure. Mismatch between the more anterior-posterior orientation of the native aorta and PA, compared to the more right-left orientation of the donor heart, can be accommodated by using extra length of the donor great vessels. When this is not feasible, the native pulmonary arteriotomy may be moved leftward to better align the anastomosis with the position of the donor PA.
- Patients with univentricular congenital heart disease may have complex distortion of the pulmonary arteries either at the site of prior cavopulmonary anastomoses (in patients who have undergone a previous Fontan procedure) or due to pulmonary artery banding performed during hybrid palliation procedures. PA reconstruction may be performed by first enlarging the native pulmonary arteriotomy to incorporate multiple existing PA defects, and then fashioning extra donor branch PA tissue into a large onlay patch to be used for the anastomosis. Removal of a ductus arteriosus stent in patients who

have undergone a prior hybrid procedure requires reconstruction of the ascending aorta and arch to beyond the ductal insertion site, which can be accomplished either with an extended length of donor aorta or with prosthetic tissue (homograft), creating a Norwood-like aortic reconstruction (Figure 2).

• Transplantation in patients with variations in atrial situs may incorporate several techniques similar to those described above. In situs inversus totalis, the arterial anastomoses are shifted toward the midline by extending the native pulmonary arteriotomy onto the left PA for anastomosis. The LSVC is routed to the right atrium using a length of donor innominate vein, while the left inferior vena cava (LIVC) is extended by fashioning a generous cuff of native atrial free wall into a cylinder or by using another conduit, which is then anastomosed to the donor IVC (Figure 3). These reconstructions pose the greatest challenge in infants, due to size constraints and the need for future growth potential.

#### 13 **What immunosuppression regimes are used following paediatric heart transplantation?**

- Immunosuppression regimens for heart transplant recipients has typically consisted of triple drug therapy with:
  - a) corticosteroids;
  - b) calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine or tacrolimus);
  - c) anti-proliferative agent (azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil).
- In the modern era, the most commonly used regimen at transplant discharge is corticosteroids, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil.
- About 70% of heart transplant recipients also receive induction therapy at the time of transplant, most commonly with anti-thymocyte globulin or interleukin-2 receptor antagonists.
- Other adjuncts to the immunosuppressive regimen include mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (sirolimus or everolimus), as well as prophylactic antibiotics and antiviral medications.

#### 14 **What are the long-term outcomes following paediatric heart transplantation?**

- One-year post-transplant survival is lower for infants <1 year of age at transplant than for older children (82 vs. 88%), due to the increased risk of death in the peri-operative period, especially in patients transplanted with congenital heart disease.
- Long-term survival, however, is superior for the youngest recipients, with 10-year survival of 66% for infants and 55% for older children (Figure 4).
- Median post-transplant survival (the time at which 50% of transplant recipients remain alive) is:
  - a) 19.7 years for infants aged <1 year;
  - b) 16.8 years for children aged years;
  - c) 14.5 years for children aged years;
  - d) 12.4 years for adolescents aged years.

Survival rates of adolescent transplant recipients are very similar to those of adult recipients.

• Recipient diagnosis impacts transplant outcomes, in that patients transplanted with a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy have up to a 10% long-term survival advantage over those with congenital heart disease or retransplantation. This is primarily due to a lower early mortality for patients transplanted for cardiomyopathy.

#### 15 **What is conditional survival and how does it impact outcomes?**

- Conditional survival is the long-term survival for a group of patients who have already survived a predetermined period of time after heart transplantation.
- This metric reflects late mortality and is often reported in the context of 1-year conditional survival, because of the dramatic difference in long-term outcomes for patients who have survived the relatively high mortality of the early postoperative period (mainly related to procedural complications, infection and early rejection).
- Median conditional survival for recipients surviving the first year posttransplant is:
  - a) >21 years for infants aged <1 year;
  - b) 20.6 years for children aged years;

- c) 16.7 years for children aged years;
- d) 16.1 years for adolescents aged years.

#### 16 **What is the impact of mechanical circulatory support use on survival after heart transplant in paediatric patients?**

- The use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) has resulted in improved survival to transplant, approaching 90% at some institutions. With the exception of those supported with ECMO, it is further evident that MCS does not adversely impact post-transplant survival.
- For patients supported with ECMO to transplantation, however, there is nearly a 20-30% excess mortality in the early post-transplant period relative to those not requiring mechanical support and those supported with a ventricular assist device (VAD) or total artificial heart (TAH, Figure 5).

• Superior post-transplant survival for patients supported with VADs may likely be attributed to the improved end-organ function and rehabilitation opportunities while supported with a VAD, leading to an improved patient condition prior to transplant.

#### 17 **What are the most common causes of death after paediatric heart transplantation?**

- Graft failure is the most common cause of death in both the early and late post-transplant time periods.
- Multi-system organ failure, infection and acute rejection are other common causes of death in the first year following transplant.
- Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), an immune-mediated disease of the allograft epicardial coronary arteries, steadily increases as a cause of death throughout the post-transplant period. CAV is the second most common cause of death beyond 3 years post-transplant.

#### *Lung transplantation*

#### 18 **How often are paediatric lung transplants performed?**

- Paediatric lung transplants are relatively uncommon, with only about 100 performed worldwide each year, as compared to over 500 paediatric heart transplants per year.
- Of the approximately 40 centres performing paediatric lung transplants, most perform only per year, as compared to about 100 centres performing heart transplants, also with an average volume of per year.
- About 70% of paediatric lung transplant recipients are adolescents (age 11-17), with many transplants in this age group performed by centres that predominantly perform adult lung transplants.

#### 19 **What are the indications for paediatric lung transplantation?**

- End-stage pulmonary parenchymal disease or pulmonary vascular disease not amenable to further medical or surgical therapy, usually with a life expectancy <1-2 years.
- The most common diagnoses leading to lung transplantation differ by recipient age:
  - a) children <6 years old idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, congenital heart disease and surfactant deficiencies;
  - b) children >6 years of age cystic fibrosis (>50%).

#### 20 **What are the contraindications to paediatric lung transplantation?**

- The contraindications to lung transplantation are similar to those for heart transplantation and include:
  - a) recent neoplasm;
  - b) active systemic infections (sepsis);
  - c) chronic pulmonary infections such as tuberculosis, resistant atypical mycobacteria, \_ìêâÜçäÇÉêá~ ÅÉé~Åá~ (particularly genomovar 3) and other multi-resistant organisms.
- Patients with concomitant irreparable congenital heart disease or left/right ventricular dysfunction may not be appropriate for isolated lung transplantation but can be considered for heart-lung transplantation.

#### 21 **What are the special indications for paediatric heartlung transplantation?**

- Although heart-lung transplantation was once the preferred treatment for cystic fibrosis and other forms of chronic paediatric lung disease, it is now typically reserved for patients with end-stage pulmonary disease and uncorrectable congenital heart disease or compromised left ventricular function (ejection fraction <35%).
- The most common diagnoses currently leading to heart-lung transplantation are:
  - a) complex congenital heart disease with pulmonary hypertension (Eisenmenger syndrome);
  - b) end-stage pulmonary disease with LV failure.
- It may also be considered in other forms of cardiomyopathy with fixed (non-reactive), severe pulmonary hypertension, in retransplantation, and in pulmonary atresia with severe pulmonary artery hypoplasia.

#### 22 **Describe the principles of candidate evaluation and organ allocation in paediatric lung transplantation**

- As in heart transplantation, lung allocation in the United States is overseen by UNOS and the OPTN.
- Prior to 2005, lung allocation was based primarily on patient age, location and accumulated waiting list time. This promoted early candidate listing, long waiting list times and high waiting list mortality.

- In 2005, the lung allocation score (LAS) was implemented for lung transplant candidates age 12 and older. It was designed to focus organ allocation primarily on medical necessity and the probability of post-transplant survival, and is based on:
  - a) lung diagnosis;
  - b) age;
  - c) body mass index;
  - d) bilirubin;
  - e) resting cardiac index;
  - f) resting central venous pressure;
  - g) ventilation status;
  - h) diabetes;
  - i) forced vital capacity;
  - j) functional status;
  - k) amount of O2 needed to maintain oxygen saturation ≥88% at rest;
  - l) pCO2;
  - m) resting pulmonary artery systolic blood pressure;
  - n) six-minute-walk distance.
- Although the LAS has not been considered valid and is not used for transplant candidates <12 years of age, since 2010, patients in this age group have been listed as Priority 1 or 2 depending on medical urgency.
- Priority 1 patients are considered a higher urgency and meet one or more of the following criteria:
  - a) respiratory failure defined as:
    - i) requiring continuous mechanical ventilation;
    - ii) requiring supplemental FiO2 >50% to maintain oxygen saturation >90%;
    - iii) arterial or capillary pCO2 >50mmHg;
    - iv) venous pCO2 >56mmHg;
  - b) pulmonary hypertension, defined as:
    - i) pulmonary vein stenosis involving ≥ three vessels;
    - ii) supra-systemic pulmonary arterial pressure;
    - iii) cardiac index <2L/min/m2;
    - iv) recurrent syncope;
    - v) haemoptysis;
  - c) an exception case approved by the UNOS Lung Review Board.

• All other candidates <12 years of age that do not meet criteria for Priority 1 are listed as Priority 2.

#### 23 **What are the principles of evaluation of <sup>a</sup> lung transplant donor?**

- In the United States, current allocation policies mandate that lungs from paediatric and adolescent donors are offered first to paediatric and adolescent candidates prior to being offered to adult candidates.
- Donor evaluation and matching is based on:
  - a) geographic proximity;
  - b) ABO-compatibility (which is essential for lung transplantation);
  - c) smoking history;
  - d) adequacy of gas exchange (arterial pO2 to FiO2 ratio >300);
  - e) chest radiograph and bronchoscopic exam for evaluation of pulmonary infection, contusion, airway anatomy and secretions;
  - f) size matching to the recipient thorax as undersizing of the donor lungs should be avoided.

#### 24 **Describe the impact of the lung allocation score on waitlist and transplant outcomes in paediatric patients**

- Although the LAS is only used for organ allocation in patients ≥12 years of age, implementation of the LAS has had similar effects in adolescent (age 12-17) lung transplant candidates as it has in adults.
- These include a decrease in the size of the waiting list, higher transplant rates, and shorter waiting times.
- The effect of the LAS on waitlist mortality and post-transplant survival remains unclear, with some reports demonstrating no change and others demonstrating slight improvements in these outcomes since LAS implementation.

#### 25 **What are the roles of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and lung assist devices in paediatric lung transplantation?**

• About 35% of paediatric patients undergoing lung transplantation in the United States require mechanical ventilation at the time of transplant, while a much smaller number (about 8%) are supported with ECMO.

- As with heart transplantation, patients bridged to lung transplant with ECMO (especially veno-arterial) have high rates of complications while on support and worse post-transplant survival outcomes.
- Although the technology is still early in its development, adults and larger children with respiratory failure and preserved ventricular function who meet indications for veno-venous ECMO may be supported instead with a pumpless, paracorporeal lung assist device, such as the Novalung Interventional Lung Assist device® (iLA).
- Use of the Maquet Quadrox iD® membrane oxygenator has also been reported in a similar configuration for neonates and infants.
- Both of these approaches employ the low-resistance oxygenator in a pumpless circuit with central cannulation from the pulmonary artery to left atrium, using the right ventricle to direct pulmonary blood flow through the oxygenator for gas exchange (Figure 6).

 While this approach may allow extubation and physical rehabilitation while awaiting transplant, anticoagulation-related morbidity remains as it does with ECMO.

### 26 What are the principles of surgery for lung transplantation?

- Paediatric lung transplantation most commonly entails bilateral lung transplantation with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) support.
- The procedure may be performed by sternotomy, bilateral anterior thoracotomies, or bilateral thoracosternotomy (clamshell) incision.
- Cannulation for CPB may be right atrial or bicaval, depending on whether a concomitant intracardiac procedure is planned.
- After bilateral pneumonectomies, sequential lung implantation is carried out.
- On each side, the donor bronchus is trimmed to the second cartilaginous ring proximal to the take-off of the upper lobe bronchus.
- An end-to-end bronchial anastomosis is created with absorbable monofilament suture in running fashion on the membranous portion and simple interrupted fashion on the cartilaginous portion, allowing for future growth.
- The bronchial anastomosis may be wrapped with pericardial or peribronchial lymphatic tissue to improve the blood supply and protect surrounding structures in the event of airway dehiscence.
- An end-to-end pulmonary venous anastomosis is then made to the left atrial cuff with running polypropylene suture, followed by an endto-end pulmonary artery anastomosis in similar fashion.

### 27 What are the potential postoperative complications following paediatric lung transplantation?

- Surgical complications including bleeding and infection.
- Primary graft dysfunction.
- Acute or hyperacute graft rejection.
- Airway complications including dehiscence or stenosis.

## 28 Describe the immunosuppression regimens used following paediatric lung transplantation

 Immunosuppression regimens are similar to those used for heart transplantation, although often with higher dosing levels due to a higher risk of rejection than is seen with other solid organ transplants.

- Currently, most patients receive:
  - a) induction therapy either with anti-thymocyte globulin or interleukin-2 receptor antagonists; and
  - b) maintenance regimen of corticosteroids, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil.

#### 29 **What are the long-term outcomes following paediatric lung transplantation?**

- Overall survival after lung transplantation is comparable for paediatric and adult transplant recipients, with median survival of 5.1 and 5.6 years, respectively.
- Within the paediatric age group (Figure 7), median post-transplant survival is:

- Reflecting the relatively high peri-operative and early mortality following lung transplantation, there is a large discrepancy between overall and 1-year conditional survival for lung transplant recipients. Conditional median survival is 9.7-11.2 years for patients aged years and 7.7 years for patients aged years.
- Chronic allograft rejection in lung transplant recipients manifests as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), which is a fibroproliferative process of the small airways that results in multifocal bronchiolar obliteration.
- BOS affects more than half of paediatric lung transplant recipients that survive to 5 years, and only 50% survive more than 3 years beyond the diagnosis of BOS.
- Initial treatment is with short-course steroids or other advanced immunosuppressive therapies.
- Progressive BOS may require retransplantation in some patients.
- Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease represents a wide range of manifestations from mononucleosis-like illnesses to aggressive monoclonal lymphomas, with the aetiology relating to Epstein-Barr virus infection coincident with immunosuppression. The incidence is higher in children than in adults, affecting about 15% of children within 5 years of transplantation.

#### 30 **Describe the principles of paediatric lung retransplantation**

- Retransplantation in paediatric lung transplant recipients is uncommon and is most often performed more than 1 year after the primary transplant.
- The most common indication is for bronchiolitis obliterans (>50%).
- Survival following retransplantation is notably worse than after primary transplant, with a 5-year survival of 33% (as compared to 52%)
- Survival after retransplantation in patients with an inter-transplant interval ≥1 year, however, more closely approximates survival after primary transplantation.
