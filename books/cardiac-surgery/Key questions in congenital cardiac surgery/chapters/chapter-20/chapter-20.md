### Right ventricular outflow tract

**Nicola Uricchio, Simone Ghiselli, Stefano M. Marianeschi**

- 1 **Describe the embryology of the right ventricular outflow tract**
- The primitive heart tube contains small constrictions, including the sinus venosus, primitive atrium, primitive ventricle, bulbus cordis and truncus arteriosus. The bulbus cordis and truncus arteriosus give rise to the left and the right ventricular outflow tracts, pulmonary trunk and aorta (Figure 1).

**Figure 1. Embryological origin of the right ventricular outflow tract from the bulbis cordis and truncus arteriosus.**

• During the 5th week of embryological development, bulbar ridges develop from proliferation of mesenchymal cells on the wall of the bulbis cordis (Figure 2). They are also derived from neural crest mesenchymal cells by passing through the primitive pharynx (Figure 3).

**Figure 3. Mesenchymal cells also migrate from the neural crest by passing through the primitive pharynx.**

• During the 6th week of embryological development, the ridges fuse together, forming the spiral-shaped aorticopulmonary septum, which divides the bulbus cordis and truncus arteriosus into the aorta and pulmonary trunk. The spiralling of the aorticopulmonary septum results in the pulmonary trunk twisting around the aorta. Proximally, the pulmonary

trunk lies anterior and to the right of the aorta near the ventricles and then distally, it lies posterior and to the left of the aorta (Figure 4).

### 2 **Describe the development of the semilunar valves**

• Formation of the pulmonary valve begins after the development of bulbar and truncal ridges and formation of the aorticopulmonary septum.

Embryological development of the semilunar valves, with: A) a longitudinal section showing the bulbar and truncal ridges; B) a transverse section of the bulbus cordis; C) fusion of bulbar ridges; D) formation of the walls and valves of the aorta and pulmonary trunk; E) rotation of the great vessels and valves; and F) a longitudinal section showing hollowing and thinning of the valve swelling to form the cusps.**

• The semilunar valves develop from separate swellings of subendocardial tissue around aortic and pulmonary orifices. These swellings are hollowed out to form the thin-walled cusps of the semilunar valves (Figure 5).

### 3 **What is pulmonary stenosis with an intact ventricular septum?**

- Pulmonary stenosis with an intact ventricular septum (PS-IVS) is a rare congenital spectrum of defects that results in the isolated narrowing of the pulmonary valve and/or the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). The extreme presentation of this anomaly is pulmonary atresia with IVS (PA-IVS), which is associated with hypoplastic right heart (HRH).
- Several anatomical features can be found in both PS-IVS and PA-IVS, involving the:
  - a) pulmonary valve including a raphe between two or more leaflets, leaflet thickening (mucoid thickening or dysplasia), fusion of two or more leaflets leading to a sleeve-like or single orifice valve. Reduced pulmonary annulus size is not frequent but is typical in Noonan syndrome;
  - b) pulmonary artery which may present with a post-stenotic dilatation beyond infancy;
  - c) right ventricle (RV) which may present with progressive hypertrophy. Right ventricular enlargement and tricuspid regurgitation may also be seen (rare), but generally, according to the degree of PS, the RV will be hypoplastic (with a spectrum including a tripartite RV, an absent trabecular part and RV with only the inlet portion);
  - d) interatrial septum where an atrial septal defect is always present, and it is restrictive in 5-10% of the cases;
  - e) coronary arteries where coronary fistulae (sinusoids) can develop in patients with PA-IVS between the RV cavity and both the coronary arteries. Due to severe intracavitary RV hypertension, the fistulae are perfused during systole and under-perfused in diastole which can cause a steal phenomenon and relative ischaemia of the RV and LV. Furthermore, the coronary circulation can be stenosed on the arterial side, often proximally. In such cases, myocardial perfusion can be codependent on RV pressure, or entirely dependent in cases of proximal discontinuity between one or both coronary arteries and the aorta, or in the case of

peripheral stenoses caused by intimal hyperplasia. Decompression of such ventricles may result in myocardial ischaemia or infarction in the distribution of the involved coronary arteries (Figure 6). The presence of fistulae, coronary

**Figure 6. Coronary fistulae in the presence of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum: A) fistula in the absence of coronary stenosis, which allows coronary steal, depending on the aorta-right ventricle pressure gradient; B) fistula associated with coronary stenosis presents a higher risk of ischaemia or infarction with minimal pressure changes; C) fistula with no forward coronary perfusion, where any reduction in the right ventricular intracavitary pressure will result in ischaemia, infarction or sudden death; D) severe fistulisation of both coronary artery systems in a right ventricular dependent circulation. Ao = aorta; RCA = right coronary artery; RV = right ventricle; LCA = left coronary artery; LAD = left anterior descending artery; AV = apical vessels; F, F1, F2 = fistulae locations; LAO = left anterior oblique (view); RAO = right anterior oblique (view); dotted lines = site of coronary occlusion.**

stenoses and coronary occlusion are thought to be related to the degree of hypoplasia of the RV and can be correlated to the Z-score of the TV annulus. The lower the Z-score of the TV, the higher the incidence of severe coronary flow dependency to RV pressure;

f) left ventricle — where the cavity size may be reduced.

#### 4 How is pulmonary stenosis classified?

- Pulmonary stenosis can be graded as mild, moderate or severe according to the RVOT gradient, the RV: systemic pressure ratio, the indexed diameter and indexed area of the pulmonary valve (Table 1).
- For treatment purposes, it is useful to classify pulmonary stenosis according to the right ventricular cavity and its predicted capability to sustain the pulmonary circulation.
- Tricuspid valve diameter expressed as a Z-score value relates directly with the RV cavity and can be used as a more objective parameter in the decision making.

### 5 What is the aetiology of pulmonary stenosis?

- Noonan or Williams syndromes are the genetic abnormalities most often associated with pulmonary stenosis or pulmonary atresia.
- Non-genetic factors, such as congenital rubella syndrome, have also been implicated.

## 6 What abnormalities are often associated with pulmonary stenosis?

- A number of lesions are found associated with pulmonary stenosis or pulmonary atresia and in the context of HRH, including:
  - a) patent foramen ovale (PFO);
  - b) ventricular septal defect (VSD);
  - c) transposition of the great arteries (TGA);
  - d) double-outlet right ventricle (DORV);
  - e) Ebstein's anomaly.

#### What is the epidemiology of pulmonary stenosis?

- Isolated PS represents 5.8% of all congenital defects.
- Almost 50% of all congenitally malformed hearts include pulmonary stenosis as a component of the defect.

### 8 What is the pathophysiology of pulmonary stenosis?

- The pathophysiology depends on the degree of RVOT obstruction, dimension of the TV and RV, the degree of shunting through the ASD and/or ductus arteriosus, and the presence or absence of fistulae.
- In critical pulmonary stenosis or pulmonary atresia, the pulmonary circulation is entirely dependent on the patency and diameter of the ductus arteriosus. There is complete mixing at the atrial level with subsequent desaturation and cyanosis (Figure 7).
- In the presence of sinusoids, the coronary circulation is RVdependent with varying degrees of myocardial ischaemia.
- If the tricuspid annulus is small (Z-score ≤-3), the right ventricular cavity is diminutive and the circulation is comparable to that associated with tricuspid atresia.
- If the tricuspid annulus is large (Z-score ≥0), there is TR and a large RV cavity.
- In patients with an atrial or ventricular level defect and right-to-left shunting, cyanosis will be present and the pulmonary: systemic flow (Qp:Qs) ratio will be <1. If there is no atrial or ventricular shunting, pulmonary stenosis can be associated with normal arterial saturation and Qp:Qs =1.
- Most of the neonates are born with cyanosis caused by the duct closure, high RV pressure and TR.
- In cases of moderate to severe pulmonary stenosis (Figure 8), as some forward flow is allowed through the RVOT, the pulmonary circulation is not exclusively dependent on patency and the diameter of the ductus arteriosus. This results in a less critical clinical picture in cases of ductal closure or pulmonary hypertension. Sinusoids are

**Figure 8. Oxygen saturations and pressures in a patient with severe pulmonary stenosis and post-stenotic dilatation of the main pulmonary artery. The right ventricle remains hypertensive.**

rare in pulmonary stenosis and myocardial ischaemia is not prominent. The RV remains hypertensive, with reduced compliance, thereby increasing the RA pressure, right-to-left shunting at an atrial level and varying degrees of cyanosis.

### 9 **What is the natural history of isolated pulmonary stenosis?**

- Survival into adulthood varies between 40-50%, according to the method of reporting. Survival beyond the 7th decade has been reported by a few authors.
- The commonest cause of death is heart failure, accounting for approximately 30% of cases. The prognosis is worse with increasing degrees of pulmonary stenosis.
- If untreated, PA-IVS is a potentially lethal condition, with death usually secondary to myocardial ischaemia or severe cyanosis caused by reduced pulmonary blood flow. Sudden death is common.

### 10 **What are the symptoms and signs of pulmonary stenosis?**

- The presentation depends on the age and severity of the pulmonary stenosis.
- Neonates with severe pulmonary stenosis or pulmonary atresia present with life-threatening cyanosis, which requires a PGE1 infusion to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus.
- In cases of mild to moderate stenosis, the patients may develop poor feeding or slow weight gain.
- Other reported symptoms include dyspnoea and reduced exercise tolerance.
- At physical examination, a murmur can be heard on the 2nd left intercostal space with a thrill, which does not radiate to the carotid arteries. Cyanosis may be present, especially on exertion.

### 11 **What are the key diagnostic features of pulmonary stenosis?**

- Physical examination (Table 2):
  - a) physical signs of right ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction;
  - b) systolic ejection click, unless severe;
  - c) ejection systolic murmur (2nd left intercostal space and back) and associated thrill are present in most patients.

b) echocardiographic evidence of turbulence and flow acceleration across the pulmonary valve.

### 12 **What are the radiological features of pulmonary stenosis?**

- Radiographic changes are influenced by the severity of the lesion and age.
- In infants with pulmonary atresia or severe stenosis, the:
  - a) cardiac shadow is large;
  - b) right atrium may be prominent;
  - c) right ventricle is enlarged, if not hypoplastic;
  - d) pulmonary artery segment may show mild post-stenotic dilatation in those with severe stenosis;
  - e) pulmonary vessels appear to be normal or slightly reduced if the ductus is open; oligaemia can appear when the ductus constricts.
- In infants with mild or moderate stenosis:
  - a) the heart is usually of normal size;
  - b) mild post-stenotic dilatation of the main pulmonary artery may be present.
- In children and adults with mild or moderate stenosis:
  - a) the heart is usually of a normal size but right ventricular prominence may be evident;
  - b) post-stenotic dilatation of the main pulmonary artery is a prominent feature.
- In adolescents and adults with severe stenosis:
  - a) the heart may demonstrate enlargement, with right ventricular prominence.

### 13 **What are the echocardiographic features of pulmonary stenosis?**

• Echocardiography coupled with Doppler interrogation of flow across the pulmonary valve and pulmonary artery is the diagnostic gold standard.

- It offers exhaustive information regarding:
  - a) level of stenosis valvular, subvalvular or supravalvular;
  - b) anatomy of the pulmonary valve and nature of the stenosis (such as restricted motion of the leaflets or dysplasia);
  - c) anatomy of the RVOT, including the presence of muscle bands and a dynamic obstruction;
  - d) flow across the RVOT:
    - i) in systole to assess the maximal velocity, thereby estimating the pressure gradient across the stenosis (Figure 9);

**Figure 9. Echocardiographic Doppler assessment of flow velocity across the pulmonary valve, which allows calculation of a peak and mean gradient, demonstrating severe pulmonary stenosis.**

- ii) in diastole, as an indication of RV diastolic dysfunction and restrictive physiology;
- e) anatomy of the pulmonary trunk and its branches;
- f) sizing of the pulmonary valve, tricuspid valve and right ventricle, including Z-scores;
- g) presence of any sinusoids and the direction of flow through them.

### 14 **What are the cardiac catheterisation findings of <sup>a</sup> patient with pulmonary stenosis?**

- Cardiac catheterisation is usually not required unless a significant discrepancy is noted between the clinical and echocardiographic findings.
- Pulmonary stenosis can be diagnosed by a peak-to-peak pressure gradient from the RV to the MPA on 'pull-back' of the pulmonary artery catheter (Figure 10).
- Cardiac catheterisation is very useful at visually assessing the pulmonary vascular bed, which is not obtainable with echocardiography.
- A right ventricular injection can demonstrate the presence of any RV sinusoids.
- Oxygen saturation levels can be sampled to calculate the Qp: Qs ratio and cardiac output (Figure 11).

**Figure 10. Cardiac catheterisation pressure tracing in a patient with valvular pulmonary stenosis. The pulmonary artery tracing is normal but demonstrates moderate pulmonary hypertension. On withdrawing the catheter from the main pulmonary artery to the right ventricle across the pulmonary valve, both the systolic and diastolic pressures change simultaneously, which indicates obstruction at the valvular level.**

**Figure 11.** Oxygen saturations and pressures measured at varying degrees of pulmonary stenosis. Ao = aortic; RV = right ventricular; LV = left ventricular; PA = pulmonary arterial.

- 15 What are the therapeutic options for a patient with pulmonary stenosis or pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum?
- PS-IVS:

- a) relief of the RVOT obstruction to promote RV cavity growth;
- b) decompression of the RV, even if it looks small.

### • PA-IVS:

- a) avoid decompressing the RV, even when there is an RV to coronary artery fistula, especially in cases of an RV-dependent coronary circulation;
- b) univentricular repair;
- c) 1½ ventricle repair.

### 16 **Describe the decision-making process between <sup>a</sup> univentricular or biventricular repair**

• The decision between univentricular or biventricular repair depends on the adequacy of the RV to support the pulmonary circulation. The criteria include TV diameter expressed as a Z-score, as well as RV morphology and size (Figure 12):

![](_page_15_Figure_10.jpeg)

**Figure 12. Nomogram used to convert echocardiographic tricuspid valve diameters into Z-score values, based on body surface area (BSA).**

- a) mild RV hypoplasia the tricuspid valve and RV cavity are approximately two thirds or greater than the calculated normal size and the RV outflow tract is well developed. This usually correlates with a tricuspid valve Z-score of -1.5 to 0;
- b) moderate RV hypoplasia the tricuspid valve and the RV cavity are approximately one half of calculated normal size (with a range of one third to two thirds normal) and the outflow tract is developed enough to allow an effective pulmonary valvotomy. This usually correlates with a tricuspid valve Z-score of -3 to -1.5;
- c) severe RV hypoplasia the tricuspid valve and RV cavity are one third or less of the calculated normal size, whilst the outflow tract is severely hypoplastic or obliterated and therefore not amenable to an effective pulmonary valvotomy. This usually correlates with a tricuspid valve Z-score of -4 to -6.

### 17 **What are the principles of medical treatment for neonates and infants with severe cyanosis?**

- The presence of severe cyanosis in a neonate with suspected pulmonary stenosis or atresia is an indication for urgent treatment.
- The infant should be maintained in a neutral thermal environment to minimise oxygen consumption.
- Oxygen should be administered, possibly by intubation.
- Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) may be indicated if <sup>a</sup> duct-dependent circulation is suspected.
- If necessary, catecholamines such as dopamine or dobutamine can be introduced.

#### 18 **What are the therapeutic options for neonates and infants with severe pulmonary stenosis, a welldeveloped right ventricle and mild or no tricuspid regurgitation?**

- The aim is to relieve obstruction and have a right ventricle with normal size and function. The treatment options include:
  - a) surgical pulmonary valvotomy (via the pulmonary artery). It can be difficult to define the anatomy of the valve if dysplastic. If the valve annulus is small, stenosis may not be completely relieved by the procedure;

- b) balloon angioplasty in patients with severe pulmonary valve stenosis;
- c) laser or radiofrequency in patients with membranous atresia. A fibreoptic guidewire attached to a laser or a 2Fr ringtipped radiofrequency coil (Coe) is activated to produce an opening in the valve, which is then enlarged by balloon angioplasty to 6-8mm (Figure 13). When moderate to severe hypoxaemia persists, the ductus arteriosus can be stented open in the same session.

![](_page_17_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 13. Radiofrequency ablation and perforation of the right ventricular outflow tract with balloon dilation.**

- If the obstruction is not adequately relieved, it may be necessary to provide additional pulmonary blood flow. In those infants in whom it appears that adequate pulmonary blood flow cannot eventually be attained through the pulmonary valve, a modified Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt can be fashioned surgically.
- 19 **What are the therapeutic options for neonates and infants with pulmonary atresia, hypoplastic right ventricle and tricuspid stenosis?**
- A right ventricular volume of <35-40% has been considered as unlikely to sustain total cardiac output. Estimates of right ventricular volumes, however, are not very reliable in infants.

- If the tricuspid valve is too small, one can assume that no significant benefit will be derived from opening the pulmonary outflow.
- Values that have been considered inadequate include:
  - a) tricuspid valve diameter <8mm in a neonate;
  - b) tricuspid to mitral valve diameter ratio <0.7;
  - c) tricuspid valve diameter Z-score of -3 or smaller;
  - d) ventricular morphology:
    - i) if the ventricle is tripartite and the pulmonary artery is connected to the right ventricle, the right ventricular outflow can be opened;
    - ii) if the ventricle is monopartite, consisting only of a small inlet portion, and there is a wide separation between the ventricular cavity and the pulmonary artery, attempts to provide an adequate output by the right ventricle are usually not successful. Instead a systemic to pulmonary arterial shunt is used to provide pulmonary blood flow and an atrial septostomy should be performed to prevent systemic venous congestion. If the fossa is bulging into the LA, the septostomy should be performed before the implant of the BT shunt;
    - iii) if the ventricle is borderline and the pulmonary artery is connected to the ventricular mass, the RVOT opening can be attempted with a limited interatrial communication, in order to favour flow across the ventricle thus facilitating its development.

### 20 **What are the therapeutic options in neonates and infants with pulmonary atresia, hypoplastic right ventricle and coronary sinusoids?**

- This is a particularly difficult situation with high mortality.
- The available therapeutic options include a staged palliation towards single-ventricle circulation and heart transplant.
- There are few reports of ligation or occlusion of the sinusoids, when antegrade coronary perfusion is demonstrated.
- In the neonatal period, a systemic to pulmonary arterial shunt or prolonged PGE1 infusion is generally recommended. Induction of anaesthesia in these neonates can be fatal, due to uncontrolled ischaemia. In those who survive the initial palliation, a cavopulmonary anastomosis is usually performed at the age of months.
- Tricuspid regurgitation is a serious complication in these patients, as it reduces the systolic pressure achieved by the right ventricle.

- If the tricuspid valve cannot be repaired, an RV exclusion procedure should be considered, with patch closure of the tricuspid valve and insertion of a tube graft from the aorta to the right ventricular cavity to maintain coronary perfusion via the sinusoids.
- The likelihood for left ventricular failure increases progressively with age, with few surviving beyond years of age.

### 21 **What are the therapeutic options in older infants and children with pulmonary valvular stenosis?**

- Relief of valvular obstruction is recommended in those infants with intermittent or persistent cyanosis.
- The rationale for relieving obstruction is to prevent the development of right ventricular infundibular hypertrophy with secondary stenosis and to avoid myocardial fibrosis in later life.
- Although surgical valvotomy was the previously standard treatment modality, currently percutaneous intervention is now used in preference.
- The indications for balloon valvuloplasty include:
  - a) infants with a RV-PA resting gradient >80mmHg or those with cyanosis due to right-to-left atrial shunting;
  - b) children older than 1 year of age, with a RV-PA resting gradient >50mmHg.
- Not infrequently, a second procedure is required at an older age.

### 22 **What are the indications for transcatheter balloon angioplasty in a patient with pulmonary stenosis?**

- Transpulmonary peak velocity >4m/sec, with an echocardiographically derived peak instantaneous gradient of >60mmHg.
- Peak instantaneous pressure gradient >50mmHg, when cardiac output is normal.
- Infants presenting in the neonatal period with moderate or severe stenosis, especially those presenting with a duct-dependent pulmonary circulation, should be treated urgently.
- Adults with moderate to severe stenosis, persistent exercise intolerance, pressure overload and the risk of right ventricular fibrosis.

### 23 What are the principles of a transcatheter balloon angioplasty?

- General anaesthesia is administered or IV sedation with local anaesthesia.
- A curved end-hole catheter or a balloon-tipped angiographic catheter is introduced into the RV, via femoral venous access.
- An angioplasty balloon of the appropriate size is then selected and tracked over the guidewire to the pulmonary valve.
- Right ventricular outflow tract angiography allows measurement of the ventriculo-arterial junction diameter.
- The size of the balloon should exceed the pulmonary valve diameter by 20-25%.
- The length of the balloon is 20mm for neonates and infants, 30mm for children, and 40mm for adolescents and adults.
- The angioplasty balloon is de-aired carefully and connected to a syringe, containing a weak solution of about 20-25% contrast medium in saline, which is inflated by hand or with an inflation device.
- During inflation, an hourglass impression of the pulmonary valve on the balloon is usually noticed. The balloon is inflated until elimination of the annular indentation on the balloon. Any further pressure does not add any beneficial effect.
- After inflation and withdrawal, the pressure in the right ventricle and the gradient across the pulmonary valve can be recorded.

### 24 What are the complications of a transcatheter balloon angioplasty?

- Arrhythmia 1%.
- Bleeding from the catheter site 0.9%.
- Femoral vein thrombosis 0.6%.
- Hypoxia 0.4%.
- Death 0.2%.
- Tricuspid regurgitation 0.2%.
- Femoral vein tears 0.2%.
- Arterial thrombosis 0.2%.
- Cardiac perforation 0.1%.
- Respiratory arrest 0.1%.

### 25 Describe the surgical principles of a pulmonary valvotomy

 Cardiopulmonary bypass is generally used with mild hypothermia and cardioplegic arrest.

- A vertical incision is made in the proximal main pulmonary artery and carried down into the anterior sinus of Valsalva.
- Any fused commissures are incised and the cusps are detached from their lateral attachment to the arterial wall.
- If required, the infundibular resection is carried out through the pulmonary valve or right atrium.
- Any hypertrophied muscular bands on the parietal and septal extensions of the infundibular septum are widely excised. The resection starts on the septal limb, passing a clamp behind each hypertrophied mass before transection.
- It is important to pay attention to the septal branches of the left anterior descending coronary artery and attachment of the tricuspid valve medial papillary muscle, which are potentially at risk.
- The pulmonary artery is closed directly or with an enlargement patch.
- The atrial septal defect is then closed.
- At the end of the procedure, the RV/LV pressure ratio and RV-PA pressure gradient are checked, aiming for a RV/LV pressure ratio of <0.75 and a RV-PA pressure gradient of <50mmHg.</li>

### 26 Describe the surgical principles of a transannular patch

- Indications include:
  - a) pulmonary valve diameter Z-score <-3;
  - b) highly dysplastic and bulky valve requiring valvectomy.
- Cardiopulmonary bypass is generally used with mild hypothermia and cardioplegic arrest.
- Once the valve annulus has been opened, the RVOT is debulked and an unobstructed patch is used to augment the anterior surface of the right ventricular outflow tract, pulmonary valve and main pulmonary artery complex.
- The patch is sutured directly on the RVOT muscle and attention is paid to avoid the left anterior descending coronary artery, which emerges lateral to the incision.

### 27 Describe the surgical principles of a monocusp valve

 This technique can create a competent and non-stenotic pathway, leading to physiological conditions and right ventricular mechanics that more closely resemble those following pulmonary valve-sparing techniques.

- Following an incision over the anterior surface of the right ventricular outflow tract, pulmonary valve and main pulmonary artery complex, a patch is tailored from autologous pericardium, thin decellularised porcine pericardium or other matrix scaffolds.
- The width of the monocusp is approximately twice the diameter of the hypoplastic pulmonary valve.
- The cusp is attached with a continuous polypropylene suture along the remaining leaflets of the pulmonary valve or the main pulmonary artery wall and muscle rim of the RVOT incision.
- A RVOT patch or hood is tailored from a Gore-Tex® or bovine pericardial patch and sutured along the RVOT with a continuous polypropylene suture.

### 28 **What are the strategies for the initial surgical management of pulmonary stenosis?**

• The initial surgical management aims to relieve cyanosis, improve cardiac output and prevent sudden death in critical cases (Table 4).

### 30 **Which pulmonary valved conduits are available for RVOT reconstruction?**

- Homograft (Figure 14) pulmonary or aortic.
- The advantages of a homograft include:
  - a) being available in a wide range of sizes;
  - b) having excellent handling characteristics;
  - c) allowing bifurcating pulmonary grafts or aortic branch vessels to be directly anastomosed to branch pulmonary arteries in the absence of adequate central pulmonary arteries.

![](_page_24_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 14. A) Aortic homograft; and B) pulmonary homograft.**

- The disadvantages of a homograft include:
  - a) limited supply of the smaller sizes used in neonatal repair;
  - b) limited shelf life of each homograft (approximately 2 years);
  - c) high cost;
  - d) immunological response (most notably calcification, especially in a second homograft replacement).
- Xenograft (Figure 15) porcine aortic root or bovine jugular vein, such as the:
  - a) Medtronic Freestyle™ bioprosthesis which is a porcine aortic root that can be used for RVOT reconstruction and is available in sizes ranging from 19-29mm. Although it has excellent short-term durability, long-term data are awaited. It is not suitable for neonates and handling can be difficult;
  - b) Medtronic Contegra™ pulmonary valved conduit which consists of a bovine jugular vein and the valve contained within. It is available in multiple sizes ranging from 12-22mm, with the smaller sizes suited for neonatal RVOT reconstruction. The freedom from reintervention is 90% at 3 years and 66% at 7 years, which is comparable with homograft durability. Young age at implantation is a risk factor for reintervention and distal conduit stenosis, whereas graft dilatation and decreased

**Figure 15. A) Medtronic Freestyle™ bioprosthesis. B) Medtronic Contegra™ pulmonary valved conduit.** *Reproduced with permission from Medtronic.*

durability is prevalent in patients with elevated right ventricular pressures or pulmonary hypertension.

- Both are available at a lower cost and greater availability than homografts.
- Valved conduits (Figure 16) bioprosthetic valves and synthetic conduits, such as:
  - a) Hancock® bioprosthetic valved conduit which consists of a porcine aortic valve sutured into the centre of a woven fabric conduit;
  - b) Carpentier-Edwards™ bioprosthetic valved conduit which consists of a Carpentier-Edwards porcine aortic bioprosthesis inserted in a woven polyester conduit;
  - c) BioIntegral No-React BioPulmonic™ valved conduit — which consists of a porcine valve implanted in a tube made of porcine pericardium, treated with the No-React technology for the reduction of calcific degeneration.
- The advantages of a valved conduit include:
  - a) a very long shelf life and a wide range of sizes available;
  - b) variable longevity of the implants;
  - c) the pericardial valves have a rigid or semi-rigid annulus to minimise distortion or external compression.

- The disadvantages of a valved conduit include:
  - a) size limitation excludes its applicability in neonates and small children, hence these conduits are used in older children and young adults;
  - b) conduits are not amenable to catheter-based dilatation.

### 31 **Which valve prostheses are available for pulmonary valve replacement (PVR)?**

- Pulmonary valve replacements (PVR) can be performed using a stented bioprosthesis, stentless bioprosthesis or mechanical prosthesis.
- The operation is performed using CPB, normothermia or mild hypothermia, and on a beating heart or with cardioplegic arrest.

- The implant technique is similar for all types of prostheses, with a single continuous suture in most cases. RVOT and MPA remodelling can be carried out at the same time.
- In patients with congenital heart disease, particular attention should be paid to excluding any residual intracardiac shunt, if the pulmonary valve replacement is performed on a beating heart.

### 32 **What are the advantages and disadvantages of stented bioprosthetic valves?**

- Stented bioprosthetic valves include Carpentier-Edwards Perimount and Magna Ease, St Jude Medical Trifecta, Medtronic Mosaic™ and Hancock™ II. These are porcine and bovine pericardial valves that have been designed for use in the aortic position.
- They have the advantage of being easy to implant, have no need for lifelong anticoagulation and allow the possibility of catheter interventions or reimplantation.
- The main disadvantage is degeneration by calcification, with a freedom from reintervention of approximately 94% at 5 years, especially reduced in younger patients.

### 33 **What are the advantages and disadvantages of stentless bioprosthetic valves?**

- Stentless bioprosthetic valves include Edwards Prima Plus™ Medtronic Freestyle, St Jude Toronto SVP® and LivaNova Pericarbon Freedom™, which have been designed for the aortic position.
- They have the advantage of allowing excellent flow dynamics, no need for lifelong anticoagulation and the possibility of catheter interventions or reimplantation.
- The main disadvantages are the difficultly in handling and risk of external compression, as well as the potential need for reoperation/reintervention especially in younger patients where durability seems to be reduced.

### 34 **What are the advantages and disadvantages of mechanical valves?**

• Mechanical valves include St Jude Medical Regent heart valve, LivaNova Carbomedics, LivaNova Carbomedics Top Hat™ Cryolife On-X, and Medtronic Open Pivot.

- They are generally bi-leaflet and made of pyrolytic carbon, graphite, and titanium.
- Traditionally mechanical valves are rarely used in the pulmonary position.
- Indications include a need for anticoagulation for other reasons (i.e. left-sided mechanical valve) and a need to reduce the number of reinterventions.
- Recent reports have challenged the well-established use of stented bioprosthetic valves reporting a freedom from reintervention of 85% at 10 years against an 80% reoperation rate at 10 years for a bioprosthesis.
- They have the advantage of long-term durability and a wide range of sizes being available, with the smallest size being 16mm.
- The main disadvantages are the potential high rate of thromboembolism due to low pressure and slower flow across the valve, as well as the need for lifelong anticoagulation therapy. In addition, potential inefficient leaflet closure due to the low pulmonary diastolic pressure and the impossibility of catheter interventions or investigations, also need to be considered.

### 35 **Describe the principles of the newer techniques that have been introduced to treat pulmonary valve disease**

- Most patients with pulmonary stenosis and pulmonary atresia present with longstanding pulmonary valve dysfunction, including recurrent stenosis or regurgitation resulting from commissurotomy and degeneration of implanted prostheses.
- Chronic valve dysfunction leads to RV dysfunction and exercise limitation. Function of the RV is furthermore jeopardised by repetitive surgery.
- Some surgeons try to minimise the effect of repetitive operations on cardiac function by performing most of the RV and pulmonary artery procedures on CPB with a beating heart and normothermia. Thus, early death and morbidity has consistently been reported to be low in recent years.
- New techniques, however, have become available to reduce the number of open interventions or the use of CPB, including percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation and injectable pulmonary valve implantation.

### 36 **Describe the principles of percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation**

- Percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation (PPVI) is a non-surgical option for treating right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonary trunk dysfunction.
- With the growing numbers of patients developing right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit dysfunction after repair of congenital heart disease, the importance of a technique with lower morbidity and mortality, good patient acceptance and efficacy, comparable to surgery, cannot be underestimated.
- Over the last two decades, PPVI has become a feasible, safe and effective treatment for both conduit stenosis and regurgitation. Median follow-up data show good freedom from reoperation and recatheterisation, thereby potentially reducing the number of operations that patients have to undergo within their lifetime.
- The Medtronic Melody® valve is a bovine jugular vein valve that is sutured inside a CP stent (NuMED Inc). It is implanted using a custom-made delivery system (Ensemble®) (Figure 17).
- The Edwards Lifesciences SAPIEN XT™ transcatheter pulmonic valve consists of patches of bovine pericardium mounted inside a cobalt stent (Figure 18).

### 37 **Describe the technique for implantation of <sup>a</sup> percutaneous pulmonary valve**

- The delivery system is prepared with an inner and outer balloon and catheter.
- The valve is then crimped down in a 2mL syringe, by a symmetrical squeezing and elongating action.
- A small incision is made on either groin for femoral venous cannulation.
- Under fluoroscopy, the delivery system is advanced over the guidewire and tracked to reach the RVOT.
- A suitable landing zone is identified as proximal to the bifurcation, distal to the muscular RVOT, with the stent covering the length of the landing zone (conduit or transannular patch).
- Once the desired position is reached, the valve is uncovered by withdrawing the outer shaft of the delivery system over the shaft of the balloon catheter up to the black double ring marker. Angiography is performed to assess the position.
- Once the valve is uncovered, the inner balloon is inflated and position confirmed, angiography is again performed to reassess position.

- With the inner balloon inflated, the second operator inflates the outer balloon to its full dimension to implant the valve stent assembly, until it opposes the walls of the bare metal stents.
- Both balloons are then deflated and the delivery system is removed.
- A multi-track catheter is then advanced over the wire to measure a pull-back gradient and detect any residual regurgitation.
- After the procedure, routine observations are performed, as indicated after an interventional catheterisation.

### 38 **What are the advantages and disadvantages of percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement?**

- Meticulous patient selection must be maintained to ensure that haemodynamic results are optimised and the safety of the procedure remains high.
- The advantages of PPVI include that it:
  - a) allows treatment of both pulmonary stenosis and regurgitation;
  - b) has good availability, including small valves for children;
  - c) is fully percutaneous;
  - d) is associated with a good performance of the stented valve.
- The disadvantages of PPVI include:
  - a) large size limitation, with dilated or hyperdynamic RVOT representing relative contraindications to the use of percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement (Edwards Lifesciences SAPIEN XT™ is available in larger sizes than the Medtronic Melody® valve);
  - b) stent fractures;
  - c) coronary artery compression;
  - d) calcification of the conduit or valve represents a relative contraindication;
  - e) possible migration or displacement.

### 39 **Describe the principles of injectable pulmonary valve implantation (Figure 19)**

• A No-React ® Injectable BioPulmonic Valve™ (BioIntegral Surgical Inc, Toronto, Canada) consists of a porcine pulmonary valve mounted inside a self-expandable stent covered by No-React-treated pericardium, and is available in sizes 15-31mm.

![](_page_32_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 19. BioIntegral injectable stented BioPulmonic™ valve. Note the metal hooks on the outer rim of the valve to increase stability and prevent migration of the device.** *Reproduced with permission from BioIntegral Surgical.*

• The implant technique allows for the insertion of the prosthesis in the RVOT on a beating heart and without the use of CPB, thus reducing the potential damage on a dilated, often malfunctioning RV. It, however, requires surgical access to the right ventricle via a full sternotomy. Minimally invasive techniques have been used.

### 40 **Describe the technique for implantation of an injectable pulmonary valve (Figure 20)**

- The chosen valve is gently compressed with the supplied loop restrictor and slid into the barrel of the delivery trocar, with the introducer tip secured on the barrel.
- Following median sternotomy, the main pulmonary artery (MPA), bifurcation and right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) are exposed.
- Two purse-string sutures are placed on the distal RVOT, just below the PV annulus.
- After partial heparinisation, the delivery trocar is introduced through a small incision within the purse-string sutures and the barrel further advanced through the introducer tip into the MPA.
- Under digital control, the valve is injected from the barrel into the RVOT while the delivery trocar system is slowly withdrawn.

- After deployment, the valve is secured with a few transmural sutures placed at the proximal and distal rim of the valve.
- After assessment of the valve performance with intra-operative TOE, the chest is closed in a routine fashion.

**Figure 20. Implantation of an injectable pulmonary valve: A) before insertion into the injecting trocar, the valve is checked for direction, with the commissure facing distally; B) the valve is gently squeezed inside the trocar; C) the trocar is inserted into the RVOT via a small incision with the aid of an introducer; D) once the trocar is in place, the valve is pushed into position with the help of external manual guidance to avoid misplacement. After deployment is confirmed, the trocar is retrieved and the purse-string tied.**

- 41 **What are the advantages and disadvantages of an injectable pulmonary valve?**
- The advantages of an injectable pulmonary valve include that:
  - a) the procedure is not limited by a small catheter or vascular access;
  - b) there is an abundant supply (off the shelf device);
  - c) there is a wide range of sizes;

- d) it is a less invasive technique (as compared to traditional pulmonary valve replacement);
- e) there is good performance of the stented valve;
- f) it is associated with a fast recovery for the patient;
- g) it is an easy and reproducible implant technique;
- h) the follow-up data show RV reverse remodelling occurs consistently;
- i) any additional procedures that are frequently necessary on the RVOT or the pulmonary artery can be carried out during the same operation, such as reduction-plasty or pulmonary artery branch enlargement.
- The disadvantages of an injectable pulmonary valve include:
  - a) calcification of the RVOT may not allow an injectable pulmonary valve to be implanted;
  - b) long-term follow-up data are not available.
