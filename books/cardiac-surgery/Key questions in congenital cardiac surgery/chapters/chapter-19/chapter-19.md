# Hypoplastic right heart

**Michael O. Murphy, Conal B. Austin**

# 1 **What is hypoplastic right heart?**

- Hypoplastic right heart (HRH) is an umbrella term for congenital cardiac defects where there is underdevelopment of the right heart and where the majority of the ventricular mass for the single ventricle circulation is comprised, morphologically, of the left ventricle.
- Although there are a number of lesions within this heterogeneous group, each with their own distinct morphological and surgical characteristics, they have in common a functionally univentricular circulation, due to either the severe hypoplasia of the right ventricle (RV) or the inability of the ventricular mass to septate in two ventricles. These include:
  - a) tricuspid atresia (TA) with hypoplasia of the right ventricle (HRV);
  - b) double-inlet left ventricle (DILV) or straddling tricuspid valve (sTV);
  - c) pulmonary atresia/stenosis with intact ventricular septum (PA-IVS), with severe hypoplasia of the RV and/or RV-dependent coronary blood flow;
  - d) severe forms of Ebstein's anomaly (EA) or severe forms of dysplasia of the tricuspid valve with hypoplasia of the RV and/or severe tricuspid regurgitation that is deemed not suitable for repair;
  - e) unbalanced atrioventricular septal defects (uAVSD) to the left (Figure 1);
  - f) congenitally corrected transposition of the great vessels (ccTGA) with severe hypoplasia of the RV.
- Common to all is an underdevelopment of the RV myocardium that variably affects the tricuspid valve, RV inlet, main RV and RV outflow tract. In the setting of ventriculo-arterial concordance, this may be associated with abnormalities of the pulmonary valve and pulmonary

- arteries, whereas in the presence of ventriculo-arterial discordance, the aortic valve or aorta can be affected.
- As with any valvular lesion in congenital heart disease, the poorly developed annulus or leaflets can result in a valve that is incompetent (regurgitant), narrowed (stenotic) or imperforate (atretic).
- In some of these conditions, the atrial and ventricular septa will be intact but in many lesions of HRH, there will be an atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect or both.

# 2 **Describe the embryology of hypoplastic right heart**

- In many lesions of HRH, underdevelopment of the RV is thought to be related to low flow through the right heart during the early stages of ventricular development from the 7th to 9th week of gestation. Around the same time, the ventricular septum develops.
- In TA, DILV and sTV, entry of blood to the foetal RV is limited, causing a failure of the ventricular cavity to develop. Any development of the RV is dependent on the presence of a defect in the ventricular septum. Lesions where inflow into the foetal RV is compromised are seldom isolated and are often associated with RV hypoplasia. At the same time, the pulmonary valve is often affected, being stenotic or atretic. Importantly, any defect where inflow into the foetal RV is compromised can be accompanied with ventriculo-arterial discordance and so the hypoplastic RV in these cases may be associated with aortic valvular and arch hypoplasia rather than pulmonary stenosis or atresia.

- If there is an intact ventricular septum and pulmonary stenosis or atresia, consequent RV hypertension is believed to contribute to the maldevelopment of the epicardial coronary arteries and the characteristic sinusoids or coronary fistulae of PA-IVS.
- In isomerism or heterotaxy syndrome, characteristically, there is a single, common atrioventricular (AV) valve. In the unusual situation where a common AV valve occurs with RV hypoplasia, this is termed an unbalanced AVSD to the left, often associated with a stenotic or atretic pulmonary valve.
- The unusual arrangement of discordant atrioventricular and ventriculo-arterial connections seen in ccTGA has a strong predilection to heart block, either spontaneously or around the time of intervention, with high rates of permanent pacemaker insertion. This is thought to be related to the abnormal morphology of the conduction system seen with these discordant connections.
- Although a persistent left superior vena cava (LSVC) can occur with almost any congenital abnormality, other forms of anomalous systemic or pulmonary venous return are uncommon in patients without isomerism or heterotaxy.

# 3 **What is the aetiology of hypoplastic right heart?**

- As with many lesions in congenital heart disease, the aetiology of HRH is multifactorial and largely unknown. In large cohort studies of univentricular patients subjected to genetic analysis, up to one third have genetic abnormalities but this may underestimate the contribution of genetic abnormalities inherited in an autosomal fashion, X-linked or through spontaneous intra-uterine mutations.
- Specific associations are rare but transposition lesions are more common in boys and Ebstein's anomaly is associated with maternal lithium exposure. Maternal viral infections and the use of angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are also felt to be important in the genesis of many congenital defects, including HRH.
- Reported associations with univentricular lesions include parental cigarette, alcohol and drug use, as well as advanced maternal age and diabetes.

#### 4 **What are the abnormalities most often associated with hypoplastic right heart?**

• Similar to the aetiology of HRH, the associations are not completely understood and in particular, if coexistent lesions share a common aetiology or are consequent or subsequent to the congenital heart disease.

- Syndromes associated with univentricular lesions include VACTERL, Apert, Noonan, agenesis of corpus callosum, Rubinstein-Taybi, Holt-Orom, Down and DiGeorge (22q11 deletion).
- There is little to suggest that associations differ depending on the morphology of the univentricular lesion. Specific genetic mutations, such as TBX5, NKX2-5, GATA4 and NOTCH1, have all been implicated in univentricular cardiac lesions.
- Associated extracardiac malformations with univentricular lesions include exomphalos, gastroschisis, diaphragmatic hernia, eventration, necrotising enterocolitis, choanal atresia, renal dysplasia and intraventricular haemorrhage.
- Amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling can be performed in utero to delineate any genetic conditions. Alternatively, diagnostic work-up can be performed postnatally with genetic analysis of peripheral blood.

# 5 **How is hypoplastic right heart diagnosed?**

- In the modern era, screening foetal ultrasound during the second trimester often identifies structural and developmental abnormalities of the atria, atrioventricular valves, ventricles, outflow tracts or great vessels. When the possibility of congenital heart disease has been raised, HRH can be further diagnosed on a focused scan.
- Foetal diagnostic criteria for HRH include assessment of:
  - a) right ventricular apex formation;
  - b) right ventricular wall thickness;
  - c) TV inflow or the presence of tricuspid regurgitation;
  - d) size and Z-score of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves;
  - e) presence of sinusoids;
  - f) forward flow through the pulmonary valve and ductus arteriosus.
- Serial scanning will usually delineate any heart failure due to HRH as evidenced by foetal hydrops or poor growth (Figure 2). Early diagnosis allows for parental education, and full and open discussion about the degree of the severity of the congenital cardiac diagnosis and the possible therapeutic options, including interruption and intervention.
- In the absence of an antenatal diagnosis, HRH may be diagnosed in the setting of immediate postnatal examination or even later, due to collapse or desaturation.
- RV hypoplasia is difficult to quantify, as the shape of the right ventricle precludes accurate assessment of right ventricular volume by 2D echocardiography.

**Figure 2. Foetal ultrasound four-chamber view with the apex pointing to the left in the images demonstrating a hypoplastic bipartite right ventricle with normal sized left-sided structures and right atrium.**

- Although echocardiography is sufficient to delineate most congenital lesions associated with HRH, there is an increasing trend to use MRI or CT, to complement echocardiography.
- MRI and 3D echocardiography result in more accurate assessment of ventricular volume but the lower limit of right ventricular functional adequacy remains unknown. Moreover, even a small RV can work efficiently to contribute to lung perfusion as part of a one-and-a-half ventricle repair, where a superior cavopulmonary connection allows for a proportion of the stroke volume to perfuse the lungs directly.
- In contemporary practice, angiography is seldom required.

# 6 **What are the symptoms of hypoplastic right heart?**

- In some conditions, the baby may not show any signs of distress and may present with an incidental heart murmur, a new atrial arrhythmia or a ventricular arrhythmia.
- When present, the symptoms of HRH will largely be dictated by whether there is reduced pulmonary blood flow, in which case cyanosis will be the predominant symptom, or excessive pulmonary blood flow, in which case dyspnoea, tachypnoea and recurrent respiratory tract infections will dominate the clinical picture.
- Cyanosis is defined as a plasma concentration of deoxygenated haemoglobin greater than 5g/dL. The blue tinge of cyanosis is most noticeable in the skin, lips and fingernails but in more severely affected individuals will be present in the central veins such as on the underside of the tongue. The compensatory polycythaemia often seen in patients with chronic hypoxia makes cyanosis more likely in these patients. Longstanding cyanosis can be associated with finger clubbing.

# What are the echocardiographic features of hypoplastic right heart?

- Echocardiography can usually demonstrate the hallmark absence of the right atrioventricular valve of tricuspid atresia or variable degrees of RV hypoplasia associated with a straddling tricuspid valve, doubleinlet left ventricle or congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, as well as the abnormalities of atrioventricular connection seen in these conditions.
- The ventricular displacement of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid leaflet, associated with an underdeveloped tricuspid annulus, RV hypoplasia and varying degrees of tricuspid regurgitation, which are characteristic of the most severe forms of Ebstein's malformation, mandate neonatal intervention and preclude biventricular repair.
- Additional information should include the:
  - a) relationship of the great vessels;
  - b) size and location of any atrial or ventricular communications;
  - c) size and function of the RV and LV;
  - d) presence of atrioventricular valvular stenosis or regurgitation;
  - e) degree and level of both right and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
- Z-scores have been used extensively to inform the management of HRH. This scoring system assesses the tricuspid valve annulus and RV volumes in relation to weight-based means to give important information about whether a biventricular circulation is possible (Table 1 and Figure 3).

Table 1. Z-score of the tricuspid valve and composition of the right ventricle (RV) used to determine the feasibility of a biventricular or one-and-a-half ventricle repair.

| Z-score of the tricuspid valve | Composition of the RV  | Likely destination                        |
|--------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Larger than -2                 | Tripartite             | Biventricular repair                      |
| -2 to -5                       | Tripartite ± bipartite | 1½-type repair                            |
| Smaller than -5                | Bipartite              | Univentricular repair<br>(Fontan pathway) |

Echocardiographic apical view of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum demonstrating an unrestrictive communication (arrow) between the right atrium (RA) and the left atrium (LA), hypoplastic right ventricle (RV) and bulging of the interventricular septum into the left ventricle (LV). The Z-scores of the tricuspid annulus are often used to differentiate patients who can undergo a biventricular or one-and-a-half ventricle repair, as opposed to those who require single-ventricle palliation.**

- Pulmonary valve and pulmonary artery (or in the case of ventriculoarterial discordance, aortic valve and aorta) Z-scores can also guide the need for neonatal intervention.
- In uAVSD, inflow to the hypoplastic RV has been shown to predict suitability for biventricular repair.

#### 8 **What are radiological and cardiac catheterisation findings of hypoplastic right heart?**

• Chest radiographs are rarely diagnostic but may show a small right heart shadow with decreased pulmonary vascular markings. In patients with increased pulmonary blood flow, cardiomegaly and pulmonary plethora may be present (Figure 4). The chest radiograph may also demonstrate atrial enlargement where atrioventricular valve regurgitation is present.

![](_page_7_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 4. Chest radiographs demonstrating: A) a diminutive pulmonary trunk and virtually no pulmonary vasculature in a neonate with an unbalanced atrioventricular septal defect to the left and a small dysplastic pulmonary valve prior to a Blalock-Taussig shunt; and B) cardiac enlargement, with elevation of the ventricular apex and pulmonary vascular congestion in a neonate with a double-inlet left ventricle, ventriculo-arterial discordance and a hypoplastic right ventricle prior to a Norwood procedure.**

- Cardiac catheterisation (Figure 5) can be used for both diagnostic as well as therapeutic reasons in infants with HRH. Angiocardiography can be used to:
  - a) confirm anatomy;
  - b) assess volume and function of the RV;
  - c) delineate coronary anatomy in patients with PA-IVS;
  - d) assess the size of the pulmonary arteries.
- In addition, it is important to measure pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and assess for additional sources of pulmonary blood flow, collateral vessels and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs). In the case of MAPCAs, angiography is necessary to assess their location, origin and territory distribution. It is important to diagnose areas of multiple perfusion (both from the native pulmonary system and the collateral system) and those areas that are perfused by one system only. In patients with significant pulmonary overflow, pulmonary catheter interventions may be warranted, such as coiling of vessels.

#### 9 **What are the contraindications for intervention on hypoplastic right heart?**

- In the modern era of management of congenital heart disease, care should be patient-centred and tailored to the individual. As such, there is no absolute contraindication to intervention on HRH.
- Multidisciplinary teams, in conjunction with the caregivers, normally assess the impact of relative contraindications, which usually relate to coexistent syndromes, genetic abnormalities or non-cardiac disease, to single-ventricle palliation.
- Many centres are reluctant to offer a single-ventricle pathway to patients with genetic abnormalities, such as trisomy or 13, or syndromes with limited life expectancy.
- Some caregivers decide to pursue in utero termination or a noninterventional course of action after childbirth. In those cases, endof-life care should be provided in the manner that best suits first the child's needs and parent's wishes.

#### 10 **What is double-inlet left ventricle and straddling tricuspid valve?**

• Double-inlet left ventricle (DILV) and straddling tricuspid valve (sTV) represent a spectrum of congenital cardiac defects characterised by atrioventricular malalignment causing the atrioventricular valves to be shared between the ventricles and overriding the ventricles (Figure 6). When the valvular apparatus of the right atrioventricular valve straddles the ventricular septum, there is necessarily a defect of the ventricular septum and therefore an interventricular communication. It is very common for there to be ventriculo-arterial discordance with this spectrum of lesions.

![](_page_9_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Figure 6. Double-inlet left ventricle (DILV) with ventriculo-arterial discordance and hypoplasia of the right ventricle (RV), which require all blood flow to the aorta (Ao) to go through a potentially restrictive bulboventricular foramen (BVF). LV = left ventricle; PA = pulmonary artery; LA = left atrium, RA = right atrium.**

• These lesions vary from a situation where both atrioventricular valves open into the LV, as in DILV, and the hypoplastic RV gives origin to the aorta and straddling tricuspid valve, where the mitral and tricuspid valves open predominantly into the LV, with much less flow into a hypoplastic RV. In DILV and extreme forms of sTV with ventriculo-arterial discordance, all the blood to the aorta must go through the VSD and the septal defect is termed a bulboventricular foramen (BVF). Although some centres have described repair of a

- sTV with septation of the ventricular septum in cases of an adequate sized RV, this condition often requires single-ventricle palliation.
- The presence of a BVF means that systemic outflow obstruction can develop, particularly if banding of the pulmonary artery is required, as secondary RV hypertrophy can partially obstruct the interventricular communication.
- A restrictive BVF may require a single-ventricle type of palliation to ensure adequate systemic blood flow. This is achieved by construction of a Damus-Kaye-Stansel anastomosis between the aorta and PA and an aortopulmonary shunt as the initial palliation to ensure an unobstructed systemic outflow tract (Figure 7).

The hypoplastic right ventricle communicates with the left ventricle through the bulboventricular foramen.**

#### 11 **What is tricuspid atresia?**

• Tricuspid atresia (TA) is characterised by the complete absence of the right atrioventricular or tricuspid valve, an unrestrictive ASD and variable degrees of RV hypoplasia (Figure 8).

![](_page_11_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 8. Tricuspid atresia with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) restricting blood flow to the lungs. If there is atresia of the pulmonary valve, blood gets to the lungs via the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) ductal dependent pulmonary blood flow. ASD = atrial septal defect; RA = right atrium; Ao = aorta; PA = pulmonary artery; LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle; RV = right ventricle.**

- Tricuspid atresia is often associated with ventriculo-arterial discordance, defects in the ventricular septum and subpulmonary stenosis.
- The degree of obstruction to pulmonary blood flow, the relationship of the great arteries and the aortic valve-VSD diameter ratio determine the exact pathophysiology and clinical sequelae (Figure 9).
- An aortopulmonary shunt, with or without surgical or interventional relief of any interatrial flow limitation, can be required in the neonatal period to ensure adequate pulmonary blood flow.

**Figure 9. Cardiac magnetic resonance image (MRI) demonstrating absence of the right atrioventricular (AV) valve and a hypoplastic right ventricle (RV), characteristic of tricuspid atresia.**

- Subsequent interventions will depend on the effective size of the right ventricular cavity.
- Surgical intervention for tricuspid atresia have represented the hallmark of intervention for the development of the 'right heart bypass' strategy (Figure 10). Such interventions have led to the conceptualisation of the staged single-ventricle palliation, which included initially a superior or unidirectional cavopulmonary shunt (as proposed by Glenn and colleagues) and then a total cavopulmonary shunt (as proposed by Fontan and colleagues). This remains the treatment of choice in most cases.
- The current accepted practice includes a modification of the original Glenn procedure, using a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt (BCPS), where the superior vena cava is anastomosed to the pulmonary bifurcation to perfuse both lungs at the same time, followed by a modification of the original Fontan procedure, the total cavopulmonary connection with an extracardiac or intracardiac conduit (Figure 11).
- In rare cases in which an adequate ventricular cavity can be obtained (either due to spontaneous growth or following aggressive RV muscle band resection), atrioventricular valved conduits (Figure 12) and closure of interventricular communication have been used to reinstate a biventricular circulation, as proposed by both Bowman and Bjork.

#### 12 **What is Ebstein's anomaly?**

- Ebstein's anomaly (EA) is a rare malformation characterised by dysplasia of the tricuspid valve. Typically, there is ventricular apical displacement of the annular attachments of the posterior and septal leaflets into the RV, producing an atrialised section of the RV (Figure 13).
- The leaflets are dysplastic and tethered to the ventricular wall by shortened chordae. Importantly, the redundant and 'sail-like' anterior leaflet is attached to the tricuspid annulus in the normal or slightly rotated position.
- Ebstein's anomaly is associated with an atrial septal defect and accessory atrioventricular conduction pathways in many cases. Although many cases of Ebstein's anomaly require no intervention in infancy and can achieve good biventricular repairs later in life, a proportion of Ebstein's anomaly present in infancy with cyanosis, heart failure and haemodynamic instability, due to a hypoplastic RV or severe tricuspid regurgitation. In this situation, single-ventricle palliation is often the only option.

RA = right atrium; Ao = aorta; PA = pulmonary artery; LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle; RV = right ventricle.**

#### 13 **What is pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum?**

- The combination of severe stenosis or atresia of the pulmonary valve with an intact ventricular septum with varying degrees of hypoplasia of the right ventricle is a rare abnormality. Unlike pulmonary atresia associated with tetralogy of Fallot, the ventricular septum is intact, the pulmonary arteries are usually of normal size, and the aorta is almost always left-sided and of normal size. Aortopulmonary collaterals are unusual, with the sole blood supply to the neonatal lungs via the ductus arteriosus. If prostaglandin is not commenced soon after birth, the ductus arteriosus will close, resulting in death.
- As there is either limited or no blood ejected by the RV via the pulmonary valve and there is no VSD, RV hypertension and hypertrophy is a prominent feature of this condition. There is invariably a generous interatrial communication with right-to-left shunting and consequent cyanosis. A particular aspect of PA-IVS is

- a RV coronary fistula and these can be an important feature when there are widespread fistulae with proximal native coronary stenosis resulting in a RV-dependent coronary circulation. In this situation, decompression of the RV by valvuloplasty can lead to severe coronary ischaemia.
- The tricuspid valve can be dysplastic and the degree of annular hypoplasia of the tricuspid frequently mirrors the degree of RV underdevelopment and the presence of coronary fistulae. In about a third of cases, the presence of a RV-dependent coronary circulation, or a Z-score of <3 of the tricuspid valve or RV, mandate a univentricular strategy.

#### 14 **What is congenitally corrected transposition with pulmonary stenosis?**

- The combination of atrioventricular and ventriculo-arterial discordance is also known as congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA). It is frequently associated with pulmonary stenosis, a VSD and varying degrees of RV hypoplasia. Over the years, many ingenious procedures have been devised to achieve an anatomical biventricular or a one-and-a-half ventricle repair, where the LV becomes the systemic ventricle. Single-ventricle palliation is still used in some cases where the RV is deemed unsuitable to sustain the pulmonary circulation completely.
- Some patients with the HRH variant of ccTGA will be well balanced in the neonatal period and so can have definitive palliation in later childhood. Those who are severely desaturated as a neonate may require an aortopulmonary shunt as their first procedure, often in the first year of life. It is important to note that heart block is very common in ccTGA, either post-intervention or spontaneously.

# 15 **What is an unbalanced atrioventricular septal defect?**

- In approximately 10% of endocardial cushion defects, the common atrioventricular valve sits over one ventricle more than the other, with hypoplasia of the contralateral ventricle and this entity is described as an unbalanced atrioventricular septal defect. A minority of these lesions are unbalanced to the left and produce a hypoplastic RV (Figure 14). Good outcomes have been reported with biventricular repairs but it is necessary to pursue single-ventricle palliation in a proportion of these patients.
- Pulmonary outflow obstruction varies from mild stenosis to complete pulmonary atresia and this will often dictate the necessity of

![](_page_17_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 14. Unbalanced AVSD to the left with a primum atrial septal defect, common atrioventricular (AV) valve and hypoplastic right ventricle (RV) with an inlet ventricular septal defect. RA = right atrium; Ao = aorta; PA = pulmonary artery; LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle.**

aortopulmonary shunting in infancy prior to staged palliation. It is not unusual for an unbalanced atrioventricular septal defect to be part of a spectrum of congenital heart disease described variably as isomerism or heterotaxy. In these conditions, there is a laterality disturbance of the abdominal viscera, as well as frequent abnormalities of systemic and pulmonary venous drainage into the atria, below the common atrioventricular valve. Not surprisingly, abnormalities of the systemic or pulmonary outflow tracts are also common.

#### 16 **What are the principles of palliation of hypoplastic right heart?**

• Postnatal management will often be informed by antenatal assessment with many parents choosing to have the birth in a tertiary congenital centre, where access to neonatal cardiology and surgery is readily available.

- If there is concern for ductal dependent pulmonary blood flow or arch obstruction, prostaglandin will be started in the neonatal intensive care unit, while accurate imaging is used to delineate a complete cardiac diagnosis.
- With the improved outcomes of cardiac surgery, many units are pushing the boundaries of biventricular repair where cardiac repairs are performed as a single or staged procedure in the presence of hypoplasia of one of the ventricles or difficult anatomy for septation. Though this is an immense achievement, it should be kept in mind that often in the process of trying to achieve a biventricular repair, the infant can develop pulmonary hypertension, which may preclude single-ventricle palliation at a later date.
- In the neonatal period, it is essential to make sure there is sufficient but not excessive pulmonary blood flow to ensure viability but also that the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) remains low for staged palliation.
- The ultimate goal for children with HRH and single-ventricle physiology is the Fontan circulation. This is most commonly achieved in a staged manner and central to the circulation is that all ventricular tissue is utilised for systemic perfusion, while pulmonary perfusion is dependent on passive systemic venous return directly to the pulmonary arteries. Most contemporary surgical techniques aim to achieve a total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) rather than the original atriopulmonary (AP) Fontan.

#### 17 **What are the principles of neonatal management of hypoplastic right heart?**

- In some cases, the circulation will be nicely balanced with flow limitation through the pulmonary vasculature, whilst in others, surgical or catheter-based intervention is required to ensure adequate intracardiac mixing of blood, unobstructed systemic outflow and an adequate but not excessive source of pulmonary blood flow.
- These interventions can take the form of:
  - a) catheter or hybrid strategies including ductus arteriosus stenting, balloon atrial septostomy (BAS), or stent or balloon valvuloplasty of the pulmonary or aortic outflow;
  - b) surgical intervention including atrial septectomy, pulmonary artery banding, aortopulmonary shunting, or systemic outflow or arch reconstruction.

- It is sometimes necessary to perform a Damus-Kaye-Stansel anastomosis of the main pulmonary artery and ascending aorta, where systemic outflow tract obstruction can occur, particularly in conditions with a restrictive bulboventricular foramen (BVF). This is a particular issue in DILV and extreme cases of sTV.
- Once the circulation has been optimised for palliation in the neonatal period, the child is usually discharged with a plan for cardiac imaging to access suitability for the second stage of palliation with a superior cavopulmonary connection (SCPC), usually performed at months.

#### 18 **What is the rationale for superior cavopulmonary connection?**

- Superior cavopulmonary connection (SCPC), particularly in the setting of aortopulmonary shunts, is a more efficient and reliable source of pulmonary blood flow, and because of the parallel nature of aortopulmonary shunted circulation resulting in significant volume unloading of the single ventricle.
- This second, interim stage of palliation popularised in the early era of hypoplastic left heart palliation, allows for stabilisation of the circulation after the pulmonary vascular resistance has dropped, at a time when TCPC would still be high risk.
- SCPC redirects the systemic venous drainage of the upper body directly to the lungs and allows for a circulation in series rather than in parallel.
- Controversy exists as to the optimal management of antegrade pulmonary blood flow during single-ventricle palliation. Too much flow can lead to raised pulmonary artery pressures and practice differs between centres whether to disconnect the antegrade flow at the time of SCPC, to disconnect at the time of TCPC or to leave some antegrade blood flow long term.

#### 19 **What is the rationale for <sup>a</sup> total cavopulmonary connection?**

- Fontan completion is generally left until the child is ambulating and the cardiac structures are sufficiently developed to accommodate a large enough conduit, in the case of an extracardiac conduit.
- By completing the Fontan circulation and ensuring all the IVC blood goes directly to the lungs rather than entering and mixing in the heart, a completion Fontan should limit the effect of chronic cyanosis.

- With ongoing cyanosis after a SCPC, many centres advocate performing a TCPC sooner rather than later. The improvement in arterial saturations after a TCPC can be limited by the presence of collaterals from the systemic venous system to the pulmonary venous system or pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae in the lung. Aortopulmonary collaterals should not result in desaturation but do lead to over-circulation of blood by the heart and can contribute to accelerated myocardial dysfunction.
- After TCPC and completion of the Fontan circulation, most patients do well. The long-term effect of single-ventricle palliation, however, results in a number of complications that limit the durability of the circulation and the survival of these patients.
- Atrial arrhythmias are a common late finding in palliated patients and can affect cardiac output as well as causing symptoms. The cause of these atrial arrhythmias is unclear, potentially secondary to surgery on the atrium at the time of staged palliation or diastolic dysfunction of the systemic ventricle. Either way, sinus node dysfunction resulting in bradyarrythmias or tachyarrythmias have led to aggressive use of medical management, EP ablation and surgical ablation procedures to minimise the impact of these arrhythmias.
- Myocardial dysfunction is a common late complication of singleventricle circulations and treatment options are limited to palliative care with symptom control, ventricular assist devices or transplantation.

#### 20 **What are the surgical options in the management for hypoplastic right heart?**

- A modified Blalock-Taussig (mBT) shunt uses a synthetic conduit to create an aortopulmonary connection and is considered by most centres to be the shunt of choice because of its ease of both construction and takedown, as well as the fact that it can be performed by thoracotomy or sternotomy. The size of the graft is selected according to the size of the patient. Because the graft is anastomosed to the side of the subclavian artery (which is preserved), it is the size of the subclavian artery that controls the amount of blood going into the shunt, at least until the artery grows to a size greater than the shunt.
- Pulmonary artery banding may be performed to reduce excessive pulmonary blood flow and can be performed by a left thoracotomy or median sternotomy. The most common materials used are ePTFE and nylon tape. Anatomically, PA bands are placed circumferentially around the mid-PA. Proximal placement may lead to pulmonary valve

dysfunction. More commonly, band placement too distal or band migration can obstruct the right PA. Trusler's rule for unidirectional mixing lesions of a circumference of 20mm + 1mm for each kilogram of body weight can be used to guide the band. Safe generalisations regarding the degree of band tightening include reduction in the distal main PA pressure to the lowest acceptable pressure with an oxygen saturation of 80-85%. As the patient undergoes somatic growth, band tightness increases, further decreasing distal PA pressure and oxygen saturation.

- Two principal operations have been popularised to achieve SCPC (Figure 15), including:
  - a) bidirectional Glenn (BDG) procedure where there is simple disconnection of the SVC from the RA and an end-to-side anastomosis of the superior vena cava (SVC) to the pulmonary arteries;
  - b) hemi-Fontan (HF) procedure where the áå ëáíì SVC to RA junction is incised posteromedially and laid onto a reciprocating incision in the right PA with patch closure of the

SVC to RA junction to separate the hemi-Fontan anastomosis from the heart.

- Similarly, two principal surgeries have been popularised to achieve TCPC (Figure 16), including an:
  - a) extracardiac conduit (ECC) where the IVC is disconnected from the right atrium and connected to the underside of the pulmonary arteries with a tube graft, often after a prior bidirectional Glenn procedure;
  - b) intracardiac lateral tunnel (LT) where the IVC is baffled within the right atrium to the pulmonary arteries, often by removal of the SVC to RA patch of the hemi-Fontan procedure.

Many surgeons now prefer the extracardiac shunt because the Fontan completion can thereby be performed on a warm, beating heart, without cardiopulmonary bypass and may have a lower risk of inducing arrhythmias.

#### 21 **What are the principles of medical management of <sup>a</sup> patient with a single-ventricle circulation?**

- Thromboprophylaxis using an antiplatelet agent or anticoagulation.
- Dietary modification or steroids for patients with protein-losing enteropathy.
- Childhood and seasonal flu vaccines.

#### 22 **What are the complications of surgery following intervention on hypoplastic right heart?**

- Death either from any of the staged operations or between stages, from neurological injury, myocardial dysfunction, multi-organ dysfunction or sepsis. To reduce inter-stage mortality, a SCPC can be performed earlier in patients who have had an aortopulmonary shunt.
- Transient arrhythmias after surgery are usually short-lived and respond well to medication or epicardial pacing.
- Heart block will require placement of a permanent transvenous or epicardial pacing system.

#### 23 **What structures are at risk during surgical intervention on hypoplastic right heart?**

- Modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (via thoracotomy or sternotomy) recurrent laryngeal nerve, thoracic duct and phrenic nerve. In addition, during the construction of the anastomosis, the innominate, subclavian or pulmonary arteries can be narrowed.
- PA banding pulmonary valve incompetence if the band is sited incorrectly or migrates proximally. Siting the band distally can cause impingement of the branch PAs, most commonly on the right.
- Glenn anastomosis or hemi-Fontan procedure right phrenic nerve, sinoatrial (SA) node or SA nodal artery (resulting in transient or permanent junctional rhythm).
- Fontan procedure right phrenic nerve, principally at the time of dissecting out the cavae for cannulation.

#### 24 **What are the short-term outcomes for hypoplastic right heart?**

- The natural history of HRH is variable, depending on the different lesions and also the severity of each lesion.
- Ductal-dependent systemic circulation or pulmonary circulations will result in death after ductal closure.
- Untreated pulmonary over-circulation will lead to pulmonary vascular disease and death.

• Prolonged and worsening cyanosis will also eventually lead to mortality.

#### 25 **What are the long-term outcomes of surgery on hypoplastic right heart?**

- Only a small percentage of patients with HRH with the optimal balance between the pulmonary and systemic circulations survive into adulthood without intervention.
- For patients who have undergone single-ventricle palliation, the longterm outcomes are, in the absence of any residual obstructing lesions in the Fontan pathway, dictated by left ventricular function, AV valve function and the maintenance of sinus rhythm.
- Though many centres have pondered whether having a morphological right ventricle as the systemic pumping chamber will be a risk factor for poor survival, this does not appear to be the case.
- The long-term survival from the original cohort of patients with the 'perfect Fontan' was 86% at 5 years and 74% at 10 years.
- While surgical techniques improve all the time, many patients with a Fontan circulation survive into the third decade.
- Further intervention for residual lesions within the circuit, repair of a leaking AV valve or EP intervention to re-establish sinus rhythm can improve symptoms.
- Atrial arrhythmias are almost inevitable with a Fontan circulation and include bradyarrhythmia caused by sinus node dysfunction or heart block, or tachyarrhythmia, such as junctional excitatory tachycardia, atrial ectopic tachycardia and re-entrant tachycardia.
- Ventricular assist devices or heart transplantation, represent the endstage management of patients with HRH and a failing systemic ventricle.
