# Tricuspid atresia

**Masakazu Nakao, Victor Tsang**

## 1 **What is tricuspid atresia (Figure 1)?**

- Tricuspid atresia is a congenital absence or abnormality of the tricuspid valve resulting in no direct communication between the right atrium and right ventricle.
- Most patients in this group have a dominant left ventricle and a rudimentary right ventricle.

**Figure 1. Tricuspid atresia demonstrated by an absence of the tricuspid valve, a hypoplastic right ventricle (RV) and a dominant left ventricle (LV), associated with the presence of a ventricular septal defect. RA = right atrium; LA = left atrium; PA = pulmonary artery.**

## 2 What is the embryology of tricuspid atresia?

- The tricuspid valve develops shortly after division of the atrioventricular canal.
- The tricuspid valve leaflets originate from the inferior endocardial cushion (septal leaflet) and ventricular muscle (anterior and posterior leaflets), following resorption of the muscle tissue.
- Tricuspid atresia occurs if the leaflets fail to develop (muscular type, Figure 2A) or following complete fusion of developing valve leaflet components (membranous type, Figure 2B). Partial fusion of the valve leaflet components results in tricuspid valve stenosis.

Figure 2. A) Muscular type; and B) membranous type of tricuspid atresia.

 The muscular type of tricuspid atresia (75%) occurs if the embryological abnormality arises early in gestation, whereas the membranous type of tricuspid atresia (25%) develops if the abnormality occurs later in gestation.

#### 3 What is the epidemiology of tricuspid atresia?

- Tricuspid atresia has a prevalence of 0.04-0.05 per 1000 live births.
- It represents 1-3% of all congenital heart disease (CHD).

# 4 What forms the atrioventricular junction in tricuspid atresia?

- Muscular type a dimple or a localised fibrous thickening in the floor of the right atrium.
- Membranous type imperforated tricuspid valve.

# 5 What cardiac anomalies are associated with tricuspid atresia?

- Ventricular septal defect (VSD) which is seen in 90% of patients with tricuspid atresia. At birth, the VSD usually permits adequate (but not excessive) pulmonary blood flow. Progressively, 40% of these defects close spontaneously or decrease in size. The resultant restrictive VSD causes subpulmonary obstruction in patients with normally related great arteries or subaortic obstruction in patients with transposed great arteries.
- Coarctation of the aorta or an interrupted aortic arch which are seen in 8% of cases.
- Persistent left-sided superior vena cava.
- Juxtaposition of the atrial appendages.
- Right aortic arch.
- Transposition of the great arteries

# 6 Describe the classification of tricuspid atresia

- Tricuspid atresia with normally related great arteries (70%):
  - a) pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA-IVS);
  - b) VSD with or without pulmonary stenosis.
- Tricuspid atresia with transposed great arteries (30%):
  - a) pulmonary atresia with VSD (PA-VSD);
  - b) VSD with or without pulmonary stenosis.

## 7 What is the pathophysiology of tricuspid atresia?

- The pathophysiology of tricuspid atresia varies depending on ventriculo-arterial concordance or discordance.
- In patients with normally related great arteries, the systemic return crosses an interatrial communication by an obligatory right-to-left shunt and mixes with pulmonary return in the left atrium. Systemic desaturation is always present, as the mixed blood flows into the left ventricle.

• In these patients, the blood flow reaches the pulmonary artery via a VSD and hypoplastic right ventricle (or subpulmonary pouch), as commonly seen (Figure 3). If the VSD size becomes restrictive, subpulmonary flow is obstructed. In about 50% of all patients with tricuspid atresia, subpulmonary stenosis develops at the level of the restrictive VSD or at the level of the infundibulum.

**Figure 3. Tricuspid atresia with normally related great arteries. Obligatory flow across the interatrial communication, with flow to the pulmonary circulation passing through a VSD and subpulmonary chamber. Ao = aorta; PA = pulmonary artery; LV = left ventricle; RV = right ventricle; RA = right atrium; LA = left atrium.**

- Occasionally, the VSD is large, with normal-sized pulmonary arteries, or the ventricular septum is intact, with pulmonary atresia.
- In patients with transposed great arteries, the left ventricle is connected to the pulmonary artery, resulting in abundant pulmonary arterial flow, producing minimal cyanosis but marked left ventricular volume overload. The pulmonary valve is normal with increased pulmonary blood flow in two thirds of cases. In one third of cases,

the pulmonary valve is either stenotic or atretic with decreased pulmonary blood flow. In this subgroup, the aorta receives blood via a VSD and the hypoplastic right ventricle. Restrictive VSD or infundibular stenosis will result in the effect of subaortic stenosis (Figure 4). In severe cases, decreased systemic cardiac output and metabolic acidosis ensue.

## 8 **What is the natural history of tricuspid atresia?**

- The overall survival rates of patients with tricuspid atresia are 70% at 1 year, 55% at 5 years and 50% at 10 years.
- Infants with tricuspid atresia and normally related great arteries accompanied by increased pulmonary blood flow tend to live longer than the group with decreased pulmonary blood flow.

- In patients with tricuspid atresia and a restrictive VSD, intense hypoxia and death ensue unless a patent ductus arteriosus or adequate systemic to pulmonary collaterals are present.
- The VSD in such patients often closes spontaneously or is excessively obstructive, so that 90% of patients die by 1 year.
- Only few survive beyond 6 months of age without surgical palliation.
- In exceptional cases, longer survival with a balanced circulation has been reported up to years of age.
- Tricuspid atresia with transposed great arteries and subaortic stenosis (restrictive VSD) is an ominous combination.

#### 9 What are the symptoms of tricuspid atresia?

- The clinical features are determined by the degree of pulmonary blood flow.
- In the majority of patients, cyanosis is progressive due to increasing infundibular stenosis or restriction of the VSD.
- A history of hypoxic spells may be present, including cyanosis on the first day of life.
- In some patients with transposed great arteries, congestive heart failure is the presenting symptom.

## 10 What are the clinical findings of tricuspid atresia?

- Cyanosis, with or without clubbing.
- Single 2nd heart sound.
- A systolic thrill may be palpable when tricuspid atresia is associated with pulmonary stenosis.
- A 3/6 holosystolic or early systolic murmur of VSD is usually present at the lower left sternal border.
- Hepatomegaly may indicate an inadequate interatrial communication or congestive heart failure.

## 11 What are the ECG features of tricuspid atresia?

- Left axis deviation.
- Left ventricular hypertrophy is usually present.
- Tall right atrial P wave.
- Biatrial P wave, if left atrial volume is increased.

# 12 What are the radiological features of tricuspid atresia?

- The heart size is normal or slightly increased.
- Enlarged right atrium.

- The inferior border is relatively flat due to the absence of the right ventricle.
- Decreased pulmonary marking in most patients with normally related great arteries and subpulmonary stenosis.
- A plethoric pulmonary field and cardiomegaly can be seen in infants with pulmonary volume overload, such as those with tricuspid atresia, transposition of the great arteries and an unrestrictive VSD.

#### 13 **What are the echocardiographic features of tricuspid atresia?**

• Absence of the right atrioventricular connection with presence of a hyperechogenic shelf in the location of the normal tricuspid valve is diagnostic (Figure 5).

![](_page_6_Picture_7.jpeg)

**Figure 5. Echocardiographic image demonstrating tricuspid atresia and a ventricular septal defect.**

- The right atrium is enlarged and the left atrium may be enlarged if pulmonary blood flow is increased.
- An interatrial communication is always present but there might be bulging of the atrial septum towards the left.
- The right ventricle is usually hypoplastic, whereas the left ventricle is large and hypertrophied.
- The size of the interatrial communication and VSD, the presence and severity of pulmonary stenosis, ventriculo-arterial connection and ventricular function should also be investigated.

• Patients with transposed great arteries should be examined for possible subaortic stenosis and aortic arch anomalies.

#### 14 **What are the cardiac catheterisation findings of tricuspid atresia?**

- Cardiac catheterisation has a limited role at present in the management of a patient with tricuspid atresia.
- A diagnostic cardiac catheter will show the right atrial pressure slightly higher than the left atrial pressure, with a prominent 'A' wave in the right atrium.
- An assessment of pulmonary vascular resistance is required prior to a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt or Fontan operation.
- Interventions are performed mainly for balloon atrial septostomy in cases of restrictive interatrial communication.

#### 15 **What are the principles of management of <sup>a</sup> patient with tricuspid atresia?**

- The initial treatment of tricuspid atresia depends on the amount of pulmonary blood flow.
- Prostaglandin E1 should be started in cyanotic babies to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus.
- Pulmonary artery banding should be carried out in babies with high pulmonary flow.
- Balloon atrial septostomy may be carried out as a part of the initial catheterisation to improve the right-to-left atrial shunt.
- If the circulation is balanced, monitoring only is required.

#### 16 **What are the principles of surgery for <sup>a</sup> patient with tricuspid atresia?**

- There is no surgical cure for tricuspid atresia and therefore palliation of the functional single ventricle with a Fontan circulation is employed.
- The Fontan circulation was initially described in 1971 by Dr. Fontan and Dr. Kreutzer separately as a treatment for tricuspid atresia. The circulation is designed to divert systemic venous return directly to the pulmonary arteries in patients without a subpulmonary pumping chamber (Figure 6).
- Currently, this is achieved with the construction of a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt (BCPS), where the superior vena cava is anastomosed to the pulmonary artery. This is followed at a later stage

**Figure 6. Evolution of right ventricular bypass surgery for tricuspid atresia: A) tricuspid atresia; B) right atrial appendage to main pulmonary artery (Warden, 1954); C) superior vena cava to right pulmonary artery side-to-side anastomosis (Haller 1966); D) classic Glenn shunt with a valved conduit to the left pulmonary artery (Fontan and Baudet, 1971); E) pulmonary trunk implanted onto the right atrial appendage (Kreuzer, Ross, Miller, 1974); F) right atrium to right ventricle valved conduit (Bowman, Bjork, 1979); G) pulmonary trunk to superior vena cava-right atrial junction (Doty, 1981).**

with completion of the Fontan circulation by a total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC), where the inferior vena cava is connected to the pulmonary artery via a conduit placed alongside the atrium (extracardiac TCPC) or inside the atrial mass (intracardiac TCPC).

#### 17 **What are the principles of <sup>a</sup> staged operation for the Fontan circulation?**

• For patients with inadequate pulmonary blood flow, during neonatal and early infancy, when the pulmonary vascular resistance is still high, adequacy of pulmonary blood flow is maintained by implanting a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt.

![](_page_9_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Figure 7. Therapeutic algorithm for patients with tricuspid atresia.**

• For patients with excessive pulmonary blood flow, pulmonary artery banding should be performed to prevent ventricular overload, cardiac failure and pulmonary hypertension. Prevention of pulmonary vascular disease is particularly important in patients on a Fontan pathway.

- A bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt (BCPS) is created at months of age, earlier if indicated, once the pulmonary vasculature has matured.
- Completion of the Fontan circulation follows at years of age, according to institutional preferences (Figure 7).

#### 18 **What are the principles of surgery for completion of the Fontan circulation?**

• An extracardiac total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) with fenestration is performed using a Gore-Tex® tube (usually 16-24mm) anastomosed end-to-end to the inferior vena cava and end-to-side to the right pulmonary artery (Figure 8).

![](_page_10_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Figure 8. Extracardiac total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) with fenestration.**

- A lateral tunnel TCPC is an alternative choice, where a Gore-Tex<sup>®</sup> tube is commonly used to create the baffle, connecting the inferior vena cava and superior vena cava inside the right atrium.
- The superior vena cava is anastomosed to the pulmonary artery in the same fashion as in the extracardiac TCPC.
- If a fenestration is needed, a hole is created on the baffle wall.

# 19 What are the traditional 'ten commandments' of the Fontan operation?

- Age above 4 years.
- No distortion of the pulmonary arteries from prior shunt surgery.
- No systemic or left atrioventricular valve leak.
- Normal venous drainage.
- Normal ventricular function (EF≥60%).
- Normal heart rhythm.
- Normal right atrial size.
- Low pulmonary artery pressure (≤15mmHg).
- Low pulmonary vascular resistance (<4 units/m²).</li>
- Adequate pulmonary artery size (pulmonary artery: aorta ratio ≥0.75).

# 20 What are the differences in current management from the traditional 'ten commandments' for a Fontan circulation?

- The age for the Fontan operation has progressively come down, although the operation should be performed after a child is at least crawling to benefit from the contribution of musculoskeletal contraction on the venous return to the heart.
- Any distortion or other anatomical obstruction to pulmonary artery flow can be addressed before the Fontan operation.
- Significant atrioventricular valve regurgitation and the pattern of venous drainage can be corrected before the Fontan operation.
  Severe and longstanding volume overloading prior to Fontan circulation should be avoided.
- Pre-operative sinus rhythm and normal right atrial size do not seem to be a prerequisite for a successful outcome but the development of arrhythmias after the procedure is associated with impaired prognosis.
- A raised pre-operative mean artery pulmonary pressure (>15mmHg) should not be taken as a threshold in isolation but should be considered in the context of the evaluation of pulmonary blood flow. Significantly higher mean pulmonary artery pressures or the need for

- pulmonary vasodilators, however, represent a peri-operative risk factor and subsequent failure of a Fontan circulation.
- Pulmonary vascular resistance is the most important pre-operative criterion and should be <4 units/m2. Assessment of the pulmonary vascular bed, however, can be difficult in the presence of aortopulmonary collaterals and systemic to pulmonary artery shunts.
- The dimensions of the right and left pulmonary arteries, expressed as a McGoon ratio (see below), is considered an important risk factor for mortality or take-down of the Fontan circulation.
- 21 **What are the different methods of assessing pulmonary artery size for a Fontan circulation (Figures 9 and 10)?**
- McGoon ratio = Pre-branching RPA diameter (mm) + LPA diameter (mm) Descending aorta diameter at the diaphragm (mm)

The risks of failure of the Fontan circulation is higher in a patient with a McGoon ratio <1.8.

**Figure 9. McGoon ratio.**

#### • Nakata index =

#### Pre-branching RPA cross-sectional area (mm2) + LPA cross-sectional area (mm2) Body surface area (m2)

![](_page_13_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 10. Nakata index.**

A lower Nakata index has been identified as a risk factor for outcomes of the Fontan circulation.

• The usefulness of these indices has been questioned as they do not take into account the compliance of the pulmonary vascular bed or any distortion of the pulmonary arteries.

#### 22 **What are the advantages of <sup>a</sup> venous to pulmonary shunt over a systemic to pulmonary shunt?**

• Desaturated blood (systemic venous rather than arterial blood) is shunted to the lungs with a much greater efficiency on the increments of arterial oxygen saturation.

 Diversion of the systemic venous return to the lungs reduces the volume load on the heart, whereas an arterial shunt constitutes an additional ventricular volume and workload to the systemic ventricle.

#### 23 How does fenestration assist the Fontan circulation?

- Fenestration of the Fontan circulation can be created with the atrial baffle conduit, allowing a right-to-left shunt through this defect.
- Cardiac output is maintained at the expense of some arterial desaturation and prevents undue elevation of the systemic venous pressure to prevent capillary leakage in the interstitial compartments of the body.
- Improved long-term outcomes, including better functional capacity, preservation of liver function and possible reduction of longstanding portal hypertension, such as varices, malabsorption and proteinlosing enteropathy.

# 24 What are the short-term complications of surgery following a Fontan operation?

- Low cardiac output with or without heart failure, often due to postoperative increased pulmonary vascular resistance, low pulmonary flow and reduced systemic preload. A functional fenestration can mitigate this problem at the expense of varying degrees of desaturation.
- Persistent pleural effusion.
- Chylous leak.
- Thrombus formation in the systemic venous pathways.
- Acute liver dysfunction, generally due to venous hypertension.

# 25 What are the long-term complications of surgery following a Fontan operation?

- Hepatomegaly and ascites.
- Supraventricular arrhythmia. Freedom from clinically significant arrhythmias after 5 and 10 years is 90% and 85%, respectively.
- Progressive decrease in oxygen saturation due to obstruction of the venous pathways, leakage in an intra-atrial baffle or development of a pulmonary arteriovenous fistula.
- Protein-losing enteropathy.
- Failing systemic ventricle requiring heart transplant.

#### 26 **What are the short-term outcomes after <sup>a</sup> Fontan operation for tricuspid atresia?**

- Mortality is approximately 1-2%.
- The progressive improvement in peri-operative outcomes of recent years is attributable to several factors, including a more energyefficient design as seen in the TCPC, shorter bypass time, the use of staged procedures (such as BCPS initially followed by TCPC), and the use of fenestration.
- Higher mortality, however, remains in patients with complex cases, such as heterotaxy syndrome and hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

#### 27 **What are the long-term outcomes after <sup>a</sup> Fontan operation for tricuspid atresia?**

- The survival rate at 5 and 10 years is 85-93% and 83-91%, respectively.
- Chronic elevation of the systemic venous pressures is likely to play an important role and is reflected in the late complications, such as atrial arrhythmias and hepatic dysfunction.
- Heart transplant for a failing Fontan circulation may be associated with adverse outcomes, due to a difficulty in assessing haemodynamics, complex anatomy, multiple prior procedures and unique pathologic changes.

# 28 **What is <sup>a</sup> Fontan conversion?**

- Traditional procedures for right ventricular bypass, where the right atrium was used as a conduit between the IVC and the pulmonary tree, were inefficient due to the progressive dilatation of the atrial chamber, which in turn would lead to a turbulent, slow flow across the chamber.
- Right atrial dilatation often led to the deposit of large thrombi within its cavity and the frequent occurrence of supraventricular arrhythmias.
- Several 4D-MRI studies have indicated that forcing the low-velocity venous flow through a tube-like conduit of a constant diameter increases significantly the overall efficiency of the circulation as a whole, reducing the overall pressure and greatly reducing the development of thromboembolism and arrhythmias.
- As a result, several centres have adopted the Fontan conversion operation, where a new TCPC is constructed, usually using an extracardiac Gore-Tex® conduit.

- Critical adjuncts to the operation include:
  - a) fenestration;
  - b) atrial wall reduction plasty;
  - c) removal of all intracavitary thrombi;
  - d) arrhythmia surgery (usually modified Maze procedure).
- A permanent pacemaker may also be required to ensure adequate atrioventricular resynchronisation.
- Marked improvement has been reported in symptoms following Fontan conversion but whether this leads to an increase in survival or the need for transplantation is still unclear.
