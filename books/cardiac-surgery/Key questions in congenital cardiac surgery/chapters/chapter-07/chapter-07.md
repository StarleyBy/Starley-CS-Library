## Anaesthesia and congenital heart disease

**Michael Puntis, Sian Jaggar**

- 1 **Describe the involvement of anaesthetists in the care of patients with congenital heart disease**
- During pre-operative planning and peri-operative care of patients undergoing cardiac surgical interventions.
- Providing general anaesthesia or sedation for patients undergoing percutaneous interventions in the cardiac catheter laboratory.
- Providing intensive care support for both adult and paediatric patients.
- Providing anaesthesia for non-cardiac interventions, including:
  - a) specialist interventions such as pain management or vascular access;
  - b) general surgical interventions unrelated to the cardiac disease;
  - c) obstetric interventions where the greatly increased physiological demands of pregnancy may precipitate cardiac problems, requiring close liaison between medical, obstetric and anaesthetic staff.
- 2 **Describe the factors that determine the use of anaesthesia or sedation**
- Patient factors:
  - a) age;
  - b) comorbidity;
  - c) cognitive and psychological considerations.
- Procedural factors:
  - a) position required;
  - b) duration;
  - c) degree of invasiveness.

## 3 **What are the differences between neonates and older children from an anaesthetic point of view?**

- Airway the neonatal airway is more challenging to manage because the:
  - a) prominent occiput pushes the neck into flexion when supine;
  - b) tongue is relatively large;
  - c) epiglottis is floppy and U-shaped, and the larynx is relatively cephalad.
- Breathing in the neonate, hypoxia occurs much more rapidly; this is affected by:
  - a) neonatal respiratory centres which although mature are more easily suppressed by drugs or hypothermia;
  - b) intercostal and diaphragmatic muscles which contain fewer Type I (slowly contracting, highly oxidative) muscle fibres and are easily fatigued;
  - c) reduced mechanical advantage as the ribs are relatively horizontal, requiring a greater contribution from the diaphragm;
  - d) reduced functional residual capacity (FRC) which usually provides a store of oxygen. This results from low lung compliance, despite a relatively compliant chest wall;
  - e) higher airway resistance with increased work of breathing which consumes more of the inspired oxygen;
  - f) foetal-type acetylcholine receptors, expressed in neonates which are more sensitive to depolarising muscle relaxants, hence, normal respiratory function may take longer to recover.
- Circulation which requires different management because:
  - a) neonatal cardiac output is particularly rate-dependent, as stroke volume cannot readily be increased;
  - b) neonatal myocardium is relatively stiff and less able to increase contractility or respond to preload;
  - c) neonates have a proportionally much greater cardiac output, due to an increased heart rate (400mL/kg/min at birth, 150mL/kg/min at 8 weeks and 70mL/kg/min at puberty).

- Pharmacology where many important pharmacokinetic factors are less well developed, including:
  - a) absorption neonatal drug absorption is altered by increased gastric pH, slower gastric emptying and increased intestinal transit time;
  - b) distribution the blood-brain barrier is less well developed and sedative drugs may cross more easily;
  - c) metabolism neonates can metabolise most drugs but more slowly than older children;
  - d) excretion renal excretion is impaired, especially in the preterm neonate. Some drugs, such as aminoglycosides, need to be administered less frequently.
- Temperature control neonates and infants have an increased surface area to volume ratio, favouring heat loss. Steps to maintain normothermia include ensuring adequate ambient temperature and the use of forced air warmers. Generating heat to maintain body temperature causes a dramatic increase in metabolic demands on the neonate.
- Communication as cognitive function develops, a child's ability to understand, communicate and reason improves. The developmental stage impacts upon interaction with both the child and parents.
- 4 **What are the principles of pre-operative assessment and preparation of paediatric cardiac surgical patients for anaesthetists?**
- Information should be gathered first, including:
  - a) history review of the case notes and discussion with the patient/parents for information about the cardiac diagnosis, other related comorbidity and history of any previous anaesthesia (both for the child and family members);
  - b) examination especially considering ease of airway management and potential vascular access sites;
  - c) investigations especially those relevant to the cardiovascular and respiratory status.
- All correctable medical conditions should be optimised prior to surgery and any issues that cannot be changed must be accepted.
- The risk level should be stratified to plan for peri-operative care. Critical care is mandatory for most cardiac surgical procedures and

- more common for many other procedures than for patients without congenital heart disease.
- Rapport must be established with both the patient and their family. Anxious patients suffer more adverse events, such as laryngospasm, during anaesthesia and premedication may help.
- Induction using intravenous or inhalational agents should be discussed with the child and parents, to aid compliance. Patients and parents should be aware of and accept the risks associated with the planned techniques, including invasive monitoring.
- Details of starvation times should be documented, especially as patients with congenital heart disease are at particular risk from dehydration, potentially caused by excessive starvation times. The usual rules are:
  - a) clear (non-fizzy) fluids 1 hour before anaesthesia;
  - b) breast milk 4 hours before anaesthesia;
  - c) other milk or food 6 hours before anaesthesia.
- Options for analgesia and their relevant risks should also be discussed.

## 5 **Which investigations are helpful to the anaesthetist in the pre-operative assessment?**

- Many routine investigations are performed to screen for unidentified problems and to provide a baseline assessment of the patient's physiology and metabolic status. Although most pre-operative investigations are performed primarily for surgical reasons, they provide useful anaesthetic information.
- Blood tests, including:
  - a) full blood count (FBC) which establishes the presence of polycythaemia or anaemia. Cyanotic patients require higher haemoglobin levels for adequate oxygen delivery;
  - b) haemoglobinopathy screen (including HbSS) which should be performed in the relevant patient groups, especially if cooling is planned, which may cause a sickle crisis. In cases where hypothermia presents significant risks, the surgeons, anaesthetists and perfusionists may agree to maintain a normal body temperature on bypass;
  - c) platelet count and coagulation studies especially as cyanotic patients are prone to bleeding, even when laboratory findings are normal. Ordering products early helps to ensure rapid and effective management;

- d) urea & electrolytes as abnormalities increase the risk of myocardial irritability or indicate underlying renal dysfunction. Arrhythmias are particularly important when cardiac function is borderline;
- e) pregnancy test which is indicated for all female patients post-menarche. Careful communication is vital for these patients.
- Electrocardiogram (ECG) to identify signs of any conduction abnormalities or arrhythmias, which may require peri-operative pacing interventions (temporary or permanent).
- Chest radiograph (CXR) which provides information regarding the:
  - a) lower airway including the size of the lungs;
  - b) other anatomical abnormalities such as sequestrated lung or diaphragm anomalies;
  - c) respiratory disease such as acute airways or parenchymal infections requiring treatment;
  - d) non-infectious lung disease which may or may not require therapy but might affect peri-operative risk or affect prognosis.
- Specific investigations, such as cardiac catheterisation and echocardiography, which define abnormal anatomy and physiology can also identify high-risk lesions that may influence the conduct or risk of anaesthesia.

## 6 **What psychological, social and legal issues may arise when assessing paediatric patients for anaesthesia?**

- A patient's understanding varies quite considerably, depending on age, educational level, cognitive ability and complexity of the lesion. Some patients have great insight into their condition, while others will have little or none.
- Anxieties or phobias may develop following multiple interventions and admissions. These should be actively managed prior to further intervention and the anaesthetist should be involved at an early stage.
- Younger patients and those with learning difficulties may need information provided in differing formats, including for postoperative care and appropriate pain-scoring tools.
- Language barriers can present insurmountable obstacles to communication, and in these cases, interpreters are required during anaesthetic assessment, as they are during surgical consenting.

## 7 **Which comorbidities or patient factors should be discussed with the anaesthetic team early?**

- Some situations require additional planning and surgery may be delayed if the anaesthetist is unaware of issues until the day of surgery.
- Abnormal airways patients with congenital heart disease may have associated abnormal airway anatomy, making conventional laryngoscopy difficult. Further airway assessment or alternative techniques may need to be planned. In adults, a number of tests are able to predict difficult intubation, although none are particularly specific or sensitive. Similar tests are not validated in children. Conditions known to be associated with difficult intubation include:
  - a) trisomy 21;
  - b) Pierre-Robin syndrome;
  - c) DiGeorge syndrome.
- Significant comorbidity, such as pulmonary disease, may necessitate prolonged postoperative critical care and therefore require advanced planning. Patients with congenital heart disease with varying degrees of learning difficulties, or other neuropsychological issues, may be poorly compliant with postoperative care, including respiratory care, mobility and medications.
- Psychological problems, such as anxiety or needle phobia, may require addressing pre-operatively. Older children and patients in transitional age may present significant problems with compliance, especially those with previous surgical experiences.

## 8 **Describe how congenital heart disease is broadly classified for planning of anaesthetic management**

- A normal circulation is characterised by equal pulmonary and systemic flow in functionally serial circulations. This may be disrupted in patients with congenital heart disease.
- Pathology can be considered in terms of how changes in pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances influence flow:
  - a) increased pulmonary blood flow with systemic to pulmonary shunting of blood (Figure 1). This type of shunt lesion includes:
    - i) atrial septal defects (ASD);
    - ii) ventricular septal defects (VSD);
    - iii) atrioventricular septal defects (AVSD);
    - iv) patent ductus arteriosus (PDA);

![](_page_6_Picture_2.jpeg)

**247 Figure 1. Systemic to pulmonary (left to right) shunt through an atrial septal defect causes increased pulmonary blood flow, as well as right atrial and right ventricular volume overload. RA = right atrium; RV = right ventricle; LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle.**

These are usually initially acyanotic conditions, mostly characterised by volume overload and congestive heart failure but pulmonary hypertension (PHT) may appear and cause reversal of the shunt and cyanosis;

- b) decreased pulmonary blood flow with pulmonary to systemic (often right to left) shunting of blood (Figure 2). This occurs when the resistance to flow is higher through the pulmonary than the systemic circulation and includes:
  - i) tetralogy of Fallot;
  - ii) pulmonary atresia with or without VSD;
  - iii) double-outlet right ventricle (DORV) of tetralogy type;
  - iv) DORV of transposition of the great arteries (TGA) type.

These are typically cyanotic lesions, due to the mixing of blood from the systemic venous return into the systemic circulation. In some cases, the mixing is obligated and complete (such as in pulmonary atresia), whereas in others, the degree of mixing depends on the degree of obstruction of the outflow tract and can vary in different physiological conditions (such as in tetralogy of Fallot);

![](_page_7_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 2. Higher resistance to pulmonary blood flow (mechanical or physiological) results in pulmonary to systemic (right to left) shunting (through an atrial septal defect) and reduced arterial oxygen saturations. RA = right atrium; RV = right ventricle; LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle.**

- c) decreased systemic blood flow which is often associated with systemic hypoperfusion (Figure 3). This condition is associated with a few anomalies, such as:
  - i) coarctation of the aorta;
  - ii) hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS);
  - iii) congenital severe aortic stenosis;
  - iv) total anomalous pulmonary venous connections (TAPVC) with obstruction to left atrial inflow;
  - v) TGA with a small PDA or restrictive ASD;
- d) balanced parallel circulation where pulmonary and systemic blood flow are well balanced but not necessarily equal (Figure
  - 4). This type of physiology is seen in:
  - i) functionally single-ventricle circulations HLHS, absent interventricular septum, unbalanced AVSD, hypoplastic right heart syndrome (HRHS);
  - ii) truncus arteriosus with a large VSD.

In these cases, the balancing of the two circulations is due to the relative resistance of the two vascular beds. In some cases, there may be a mechanical obstruction to the pulmonary circulation preventing the circulation to overflow to the lungs.

![](_page_8_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 3. Decreased systemic blood flow distal to an obstruction (left ventricular outflow tract obstruction). RA = right atrium; RV = right ventricle; LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle.**

![](_page_8_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 4. Balanced circulation with total mixing of blood in a 'common ventricular cavity'. The oxygen saturations of blood entering the systemic and pulmonary circulations are the same. RA = right atrium; RV = right ventricle; LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle.**

Many precipitants, such as infection, pulmonary hypertension or systemic vasodilatation, acutely disrupt this equilibrium, exacerbating cyanosis or congestive heart failure.

## 9 **What are the principles of anaesthesia for patients with congenital heart disease?**

- The circulation may be destabilised by many events that occur during anaesthesia, including:
  - a) reduced venous return to the right ventricle;
  - b) reduced myocardial function;
  - c) increased pulmonary vascular resistance with subsequent reduced venous return to the left ventricle;
  - d) decreased systemic vascular resistance with reduced aortic root pressure, potentially impairing coronary artery blood flow;
  - e) abnormal temperature or glucose availability altering enzyme function in the myocardium and other tissues.
- As patients are usually hypovolaemic, secondary to pre-operative starvation and vasodilatation caused by anaesthetic agents, venous return must be carefully monitored.
- Excess bleeding, potentially due to failed haemostatic management, may cause reduced preload and circulatory instability.
- Many anaesthetic agents suppress myocardial function. These effects are minimised by balanced anaesthetic techniques, typically utilising opioids, sedatives and a muscle relaxant.
- Induction and extubation are high-risk periods, requiring extra vigilance, as both hypoventilation and positive intrathoracic pressure causing hypercapnia can increase pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR).
- Hypothermia and hyperthermia are a hazard to the circulation and metabolic homeostasis. Effective temperature control includes active warming or cooling, both off and on cardiopulmonary bypass. Adequate temperature control helps to minimise coagulation abnormalities.
- Neonates have minimal ability to store glycogen and glucosecontaining fluids may be required.
- Endocarditis is a risk and prophylactic antibiotics should always be considered.
- Patients with abnormal connections between the left and right heart are at risk of paradoxical emboli from intravenous injections.

## 10 **What are the principles of anaesthesia in the presence of a cyanotic lesion?**

- Cyanosis occurs when arterial blood contains deoxyhaemoglobin at concentrations greater than 20g/L. In cyanotic lesions, it can worsen when:
  - a) oxygen saturation in the pulmonary veins is reduced due to a ventilation-perfusion mismatch, such as with ventilatory failure, pulmonary oedema or pneumonia;
  - b) excessive right-to-left shunting.
- Management of cyanosis involves manipulation of ventilation and vascular resistance.
- Right-to-left shunting is encouraged by a rise in PVR, a fall in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) or a combination of both.
- PVR elevation may be caused by hypoxia, hypercarbia or acidosis. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) directly increases PVR but may indirectly decrease it by avoiding alveolar collapse and subsequent hypoxia.
- Poor fluid resuscitation results in acidosis and increased PVR, whereas fluid overload causes pulmonary oedema, hypoxia and increased PVR.
- Extubation is a particularly challenging period. Although early extubation avoids coughing and increased PVR, due to irritation from the endotracheal tube, it risks hypoxia and hypercarbia.
- Anaesthetic agents frequently reduce SVR and systemic vasopressors may be needed to maintain the balance between PVR and SVR.

## 11 **What are the principles of management in <sup>a</sup> patient undergoing repair of an Ebstein's anomaly?**

- Ebstein's anomaly occurs when the tricuspid valve leaflets fail to delaminate from the myocardium. The functional annulus is displaced into the right ventricle with varying degrees of 'atrialisation' of the right ventricle, tricuspid regurgitation and right atrial dilatation. Cardiac output may fall due to increased regurgitant flow.
- The main anaesthetic risks include:
  - a) poor cardiac output;
  - b) right-to-left shunting through an interatrial communication;
  - c) increased susceptibility to arrhythmias.

- The goals are to minimise PVR, optimise preload and maintain myocardial contractility.
- Maintaining sinus rhythm and right ventricular preload more effectively supports cardiac output than using inotropes or vasopressors.
- Some authors advocate the use of a small dose of a vasopressor agent to maintain adequate systemic perfusion pressure and avoid the administration of a large amount of fluid, thus preventing further dilatation of the right ventricle.

## 12 **What are the principles of managing <sup>a</sup> neonate with hypoplastic left heart syndrome?**

- Neonates with HLHS have a single functional (right) ventricle. Mixed pulmonary and systemic venous blood is ejected into systemic and pulmonary circulations (Figure 5). Flow distribution to the two circulations is dependent on PVR and SVR.
- In these patients, neonatal PVR is too high to allow passive pulmonary flow, making conversion to a parallel circulation impossible.
- The first operation is usually a Norwood procedure with a neo-aorta constructed from pulmonary artery and is performed within the first week of life. The pulmonary circulation is provided by a Blalock-Taussig shunt or a RV-to-PA conduit (Sano modification, Figure 6).
- Pre-operatively, the goals are to optimise:
  - a) pulmonary function, especially to avoid infection;
  - b) systemic perfusion, by:
    - i) maintaining a patent ductus arteriosus using prostaglandin E2;
    - ii) keeping the SVR low and PVR high to maintain balance;
    - iii) using inotropes.

## • The peri-operative challenges include:

- a) balancing pulmonary and systemic perfusion in the context of pulmonary hyper-reactivity. This can potentially be achieved by modifying ventilation parameters;
- b) managing myocardial dysfunction and ischaemia;
- c) minimising cerebral hypoxia during circulatory arrest which can be improved by increasing the:
  - i) perfusion pressure;

![](_page_12_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 5. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome, characterised by hypoplasia of the mitral valve, aortic valve, left ventricle and ascending aorta. The systemic circulation is maintained by flow across a large patent ductus arteriosus. Blood circulates both antegradely in the descending aorta and retrogradely into the aortic arch and coronary arteries. A drop in pulmonary vascular resistance will favour circulation into the lungs and reduce flow into the systemic circulation. RA = right atrium; RV = right ventricle; LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle; IVC = inferior vena cava; SVC = superior vena cava; Asc Ao = ascending aorta; PDA = patent ductus arteriosus; MPA = main pulmonary artery.**

- ii) haemoglobin;
- iii) arterial carbon dioxide tension.
- Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is useful to monitor cerebral saturations.

![](_page_13_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 6. Circulation following the Norwood procedure, where pulmonary venous (red) and systemic venous (blue) blood mix in the atria via an atrial septal defect, resulting in mixed blood ejected into common outflow with a balanced circulation. RA = right atrium; RV = right ventricle; LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle; IVC = inferior vena cava; SVC = superior vena cava; Neo-Ao = neo-aorta; BTS = Blalock-Taussig shunt.**

## 13 **What are the anaesthetic considerations for <sup>a</sup> patient with a single ventricle?**

- Single ventricles provide flow to both the pulmonary and systemic circulations, acting as systems in parallel, with flow depending on the relative resistances in the circuits.
- A bidirectional Glenn procedure (Figure 7) can usually be performed by the age of 6 months. Pressure monitoring from internal jugular lines then reflects pulmonary artery pressures.

![](_page_14_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 7. Bidirectional Glenn procedure, where the superior vena cava is anastomosed to the pulmonary artery. Oxygenated blood (red) enters the right atrium through an atrial septal defect and mixed blood (purple) is ejected into the systemic circulation. BTS = Blalock-Taussig shunt; PA = pulmonary artery; SVC = superior vena cava.**

- Total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) is usually achieved by 4 years. As blood flow through the lungs is then entirely passive, minimising the PVR is vital (Figure 8).
- When managing a TCPC circulation, it is important to avoid an elevation in PVR due to:
  - a) hypoxia;
  - b) hypercarbia;
  - c) acidosis;
  - d) drugs (e.g. ketamine).

![](_page_15_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 8. Total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) circulation, where venous blood (blue) flows passively from the superior and inferior vena cavae into the pulmonary circulation. Oxygenated blood (red) returns to the right ventricle via an atrial septal defect and is ejected into the systemic circulation. PA = pulmonary artery; IVC = inferior vena cava; SVC = superior vena cava.**

- Hypovolaemia is poorly tolerated in passive circulations.
- As the risk of arrhythmias is increased in this patient population and is poorly tolerated, maintenance of sinus rhythm is paramount. This is particularly problematic where the whole right atrium is within the circuit (classical Fontan) rather than only the vena cavae (TCPC).
- Often the function of the systemic ventricle, which is a morphological right ventricle, is impaired and responds poorly to increased metabolic demand. Over time, hypertrophy and dilatation occur and response to inotropes is poor.

• Central venous lines are a very significant risk, especially for thrombosis or post-surgical line obstruction to venous drainage.

## 14 **What are the principles of anaesthesia in <sup>a</sup> patient undergoing repair of coarctation of the aorta with poor left ventricular function?**

- All obstructions to systemic blood flow causing a severe increase in afterload lead to upper body hypertension and congestive heart failure. In patients with coarctation of the aorta, the obstruction can cause severe impairment of left ventricular function in the early days, especially when the PDA spontaneously closes.
- When preparing for surgery in these patients, the blood pressure may be monitored above and below the coarctation via the right radial and femoral arteries.
- Pre-operative inotropes may be required to support ventricular contractility and cardiac output.
- Significant proximal hypertension with cross-clamping of the aorta may require vasodilators.
- Some centres use a small dose of heparin during the procedure to prevent stasis-related clotting in the proximity of the vascular clamps.
- Hyperventilation should be avoided throughout, as it causes vasoconstriction with reduced cerebral and spinal perfusion.
- Postoperative analgesia provides comfort and control of hypertension. Intercostal blocks can be sited under direct vision intra-operatively to effect this.

## 15 **What are the principles of anaesthesia for <sup>a</sup> patient with pulmonary atresia and an intact ventricular septum?**

- Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA-IVS) is one of the most challenging conditions that an anaesthetist might need to face (Figure 9).
- It is characterised by right ventricular hypertrophy and hypoplasia, capable of generating supra-systemic pressures, and varying degrees of tricuspid valve hypoplasia.
- The degree of hypoplasia of the tricuspid valve is directly linked to the presence of coronary sinusoids. These ventriculo-coronary fistulae render myocardial perfusion dependent on intracavitary pressures.
- As a result, any change in preload, central venous pressure and systemic vascular resistance, can affect myocardial perfusion, especially when coronary arteries present with significant stenoses.

![](_page_17_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 9. Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum. As blood cannot be ejected from the right ventricle, all pulmonary flow occurs through a patent ductus arteriosus. Venous blood (blue) enters the left atrium via an atrial septal defect, mixing with oxygenated blood (red) from the pulmonary veins. Note the right ventricular dependent sinusoids feeding the coronary circulation. ASD = atrial septal defect; PDA = patent ductus arteriosus.**

- Pulmonary flow is PDA-dependent, requiring pre-operative prostaglandin E2.
- Although radiofrequency perforation and dilatation of the valve may be possible, tamponade is a recognised risk and adequate vascular access is required pre-procedure.
- Total atresia of the infundibulum requires a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (BTS) to produce a balanced circulation.
- Inotropes are associated with an increased subpulmonary gradient and should be avoided where possible.

## 16 **What are the principles of anaesthesia for ligation of <sup>a</sup> patent ductus arteriosus in a preterm neonate?**

- Patency of the ductus arteriosus in preterm infants is inversely proportional to gestational age. Approximately 50% of preterm infants <1200g will have a PDA.
- Preterm neonates are challenging to anaesthetise and full cardiac assessment is necessary, as PDA is associated with other conditions, such as coarctation of the aorta, ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis and aortic stenosis.
- Respiratory disease and intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) elevate PVR, inhibiting closure of the PDA.
- Although PDA ligation is usually a short procedure with minimal blood loss, significant bleeding may occur if the pulmonary artery, aorta or ductus are torn. Sufficient vascular access should be in place.
- Although retraction of the lung during surgical exposure is unavoidable, it further impairs ventilation and is poorly tolerated.
- Inotropic support may be necessary postoperatively.
- Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury may cause stridor following extubation.
- Some cases can now be undertaken in the cardiac catheter laboratory.

## 17 **What are the principles of anaesthesia for <sup>a</sup> patient with an obstructed total anomalous pulmonary venous connection?**

- In obstructed TAPVC, the pulmonary venous return is limited by the severity of the obstruction. Significant stenosis has several catastrophic consequences, including:
  - a) low cardiac output and shock, due to a lack of LV preload;
  - b) pulmonary oedema due to pulmonary venous hypertension;
  - c) right heart failure and systemic venous congestion due to pulmonary arterial hypertension.
- Presenting features include cyanosis, tachypnoea, acidosis, pulmonary oedema, pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure.
- Management of pulmonary hypertension by IPPV to improve oxygenation may be necessary pre-operatively.
- Arterial access is required for monitoring of both cardiovascular and metabolic status.

- In addition to systemic blood pressure, both right and left atrial pressure should be monitored post-bypass.
- Pulmonary hypertension may persist post-bypass but may be managed by ventilation and pulmonary vasodilators, such as milrinone and nitric oxide. If these fail, atrial fenestration allows decompression through a right-left shunt.
- Delayed sternal closure may be required to improve right ventricular function.
- Special care is necessary during any transfers.

## 18 **Describe how the risk of anaesthesia can be minimised in a patient with Eisenmenger syndrome**

- Anaesthesia in a patient with Eisenmenger syndrome carries significant mortality and should not be performed unless essential.
- Adequate venous return is crucial in pulmonary hypertension. Preoperative starvation should not exceed international recommendations:
  - a) solid food and milk 6 hours;
  - b) clear fluids 1 hour.
- Systemic arterial pressure fluctuates with variations in SVR and PVR.
- When intracardiac communications are present, right-to-left shunting and worsening cyanosis will be exacerbated by a:
  - a) fall in SVR, such as caused by anaesthesia;
  - b) rise in PVR, such as caused by hypoxia, hypercarbia or inadequate anaesthesia/analgesia.
- Similarly, left-to-right shunting, which occurs with RV dilatation, further dysfunction and increased risk of arrhythmias, increases with elevation in the SVR, such as caused by pain, anxiety or inadequate anaesthesia.
- Fluctuations in the heart rate and myocardial contractility should be avoided. Effective communication between the surgeon and anaesthetist allows responses to surgical stimuli to be minimised.
- Oral anticoagulants should be converted to short-acting intravenous agents peri-operatively, to avoid both thrombosis and excessive bleeding.

## 19 **How does the presence of congenital heart disease influence haemostasis?**

- Coagulation in congenital heart disease, especially cyanotic lesions with polycythaemia, is modified by a number of factors, including:
  - a) thrombocytopaenia;
  - b) reduced fibrinogen levels;
  - c) increased fibrinolysis;
  - d) decreased levels of factors V and VIII, possibly secondary to liver hypoperfusion.
- Polycythaemia and hyperviscosity cause impaired flow, which is implicated in thrombus formation.
- Cardiopulmonary bypass causes haemodilution and exposes blood to synthetic surfaces. Inflammatory and coagulation pathways are activated, causing platelet dysfunction and coagulation abnormalities independent of heparin.

## 20 **What are the implications of congenital heart disease for peri-operative blood transfusion?**

- Previous transfusions are common, increasing the risk of antibody formation and making cross-matching more complex than usual.
- Rapid, point-of-care testing including HemoCue®, SpHb and thromboelastography® (TEG®) can guide the administration of blood products and reduce the exposure to risk from excessive bleeding or thromboembolic events, especially in complex redo procedures or surgery for single-ventricle palliation.
- Cyanotic patients with poor cardiac output may require an increased haematocrit. Over-transfusion, however, causes hyperviscosity and fluid overload, in addition to recognised risks, such as transfusionassociated lung injury (TRALI).

## 21 **What are the anaesthetic considerations for percutaneous device closure of an atrial septal defect?**

- Although small ASDs may be closed percutaneously, the cardiac catheterisation laboratory environment can be challenging for the anaesthetist because:
  - a) access to the patient is limited by conflicting equipment requirements;

- b) ambient light is low, to improve contrast on the display screens;
- c) temperature control is often not as effective as in the operating theatre;
- d) anaesthetic gas scavenging, gas supply and air-change rates rarely reach operating theatre standards.
- Vascular access sites and consent for transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) should be confirmed pre-procedure.
- Blood loss from the puncture sites may be underestimated.
- Device displacement or embolisation are rare complications, with a reported rate of 0.55%, necessitating percutanous retrieval or open surgery.

## 22 **What strategies may be used to improve weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass?**

- Weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass is one of the most critical phases of the entire operation and must be managed with maximal communication and clarity of action. The anaesthetist, surgeon and perfusionist should operate according to one common strategy and sequence of events.
- One of the most important factors for a successful wean is achieving an adequate repair. Residual lesions are generally poorly tolerated, both from a haemodynamic balancing and myocardial function standpoint.
- It is paramount that attention is placed at identifying any early signs of myocardial dysfunction and circulatory imbalance. Ventilation and pulmonary function need to be optimised prior to initiating the weaning procedures.
- Most groups adopt agreed weaning protocols, to eliminate misunderstandings and adverse events.
- The effects of residual lesions are numerous and can be severe, including:
  - a) pressure overload in the presence of residual stenoses, such as RVOT obstruction, mitral stenosis or LVOT obstruction; this will worsen the oxygen supply-demand balance, leading to right ventricular failure, left ventricular failure or biventricular failure, which can have catastrophic consequences;
  - b) volume overload in the presence of a residual VSD, significant atrioventricular valve regurgitation or an untreated

large PDA; this will reduce systemic cardiac output and/or result in pulmonary overflow at the expense of systemic perfusion, leading to both cerebral and myocardial hypoperfusion, and early ventricular failure.

- Early signs of myocardial dysfunction may be identified by:
  - a) poor systemic blood pressure in the presence of a normal afterload and adequate preload;
  - b) high venous pressures (including left atrial pressure when indicated) and inadequate systemic pressure;
  - c) poor pulmonary blood flow as indicated by low end-tidal CO2;
  - d) decreasing arterial oxygen saturation;
  - e) direct observation of a poorly contracting heart, mottled epicardium, distended ventricles and ensuing bradycardia;
  - f) TOE or epicardial echocardiographic evidence.
- Arrhythmias have a significant impact on cardiac function, including:
  - a) bradycardia which causes a linear reduction in cardiac output in children;
  - b) tachyarrhythmias which reduce diastolic filling time and coronary perfusion, and increase myocardial work;
  - c) epicardial pacing which may be required to achieve optimal rate and rhythm.
- Filling pressures should be optimised. As PVR varies more in children, right atrial pressure (RAP) may not reflect left-sided filling pressures, and hence it may be necessary to directly monitor left atrial pressure (LAP).
- Calcium handling in the neonatal myocardium is immature and extracellular calcium has a more significant role. Ionised calcium levels must be targeted to optimise contractility.
- Inotropes may be required, with the choice of agent depending on the underlying pathology. In view of the relative hypertrophy of the RV and reactive pulmonary vasculature, milrinone is commonly used in infants.
- Temperature and adequate rewarming procedures are paramount to maintain control of vascular tone, ventricular afterload and enzymatic function, especially for the coagulation system.
- Failure to respond to pharmacological measures may necessitate the use of mechanical assist devices, usually extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or ventricular assist devices (VAD).

## 23 **Describe the monitoring used for anaesthesia on patients with congenital heart disease**

• Minimum monitoring standards are set for all patients undergoing general anaesthesia (including transfer) and are shown in italics below. They ensure both safety and lack of awareness and pain (Figure 10).

## 24 **What are the principles behind cerebral oximetry monitoring in congenital cardiac surgery?**

• Unlike haemoglobin, bone and tissue are largely transparent to nearinfrared (IR) light.

• Oxyhaemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin absorb different wavelengths of IR light maximally (Figure 11). The relative absorption of IR light at 730nm and 810nm by oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin is estimated from the proportion of reflected light.

![](_page_25_Figure_3.jpeg)

**Figure 11. Oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin absorbs IR light to different extents at different wavelengths. The relative proportions of each can therefore be measured.**

- Unlike conventional pulse oximtery, cerebral oximetry does not require pulsatile flow. It can therefore be used during cardiopulmonary bypass
- Regional oxygen saturation is measured by placing a light-emitting source and a photo-detector over adjacent portions of skin. With the oximeter on the forehead, cerebral cortex oxygenation can be estimated (Figure 12).
- Cerebral oxygenation can be used as a marker of cerebral perfusion. Manipulation of systemic blood flow, cerebral vascular tone and haematocrit aids optimisation.

## 25 **What are the risks with central venous access in <sup>a</sup> patient with congenital heart disease (Figure 13)?**

- Although rare, complications may be fatal and must be considered prior to line placement. The frequency of complications is inversely proportional to the patient's weight.
- Immediate risks include:
  - a) trauma to vessels (aberrant anatomy increases risk);
  - b) arterial cannulation;
  - c) arrhythmias particularly if lines or wires enter the atrium;
  - d) air embolus which may become paradoxical in the presence of shunts, especially in spontaneously ventilated patients;
  - e) embolisation of catheter or guidewire parts, if multiple lines are inserted.

## • Early risks include:

- a) blood loss which may be concealed under the drapes;
- b) pneumothorax, haemothorax or hydrothorax especially when internal jugular or subclavian vessels are cannulated.

## • Medium-term risks include:

- a) infection;
- b) venous thrombosis especially with subclavian lines.

## • Long-term risks include:

- a) vessel occlusion which may result in problems for future catheterisation or surgery;
- b) vessel stenosis which is particularly important in passive circulations where venous return (and therefore cardiac output) may be impaired.
- Risks can be reduced by simple manoeuvres, including:
  - a) ultrasound which reduces the risk of mechanical complications;
  - b) Trendelenburg position which minimises the chance of air embolus;

- c) sterile precautions during line insertion and subsequent use, as per 'Matching Michigan';
- d) leaving lines áå ëáíì for the shortest possible time.

## 26 **What are the indications and risks associated with transoesophageal echocardiography?**

• TOE allows dynamic imaging of the heart and great vessels. Probes are available for children heavier than 3.5kg (Figure 14).

![](_page_28_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Figure 14. A 7mm paediatric TOE probe. The close-up shows the articulated scanning tip, which allows movement through a wide range of angles.**

- The indications are wide ranging and include:
  - a) assessment of anatomy when transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is non-diagnostic, or impossible due to patient compliance, surgical access or poor windows;
  - b) diagnosing pathology, including endocarditis or thrombus, prior to cardioversion;
  - c) immediate evaluation of surgical results in theatre;

- d) guiding percutaneous device placement for procedures, such as ASD occlusion, pulmonary valve replacement or transseptal atrial line placement.
- Complications associated with TOE are uncommon but can be serious and include:
  - a) airway direct trauma or displacement of the endotracheal tube by the probe;
  - b) breathing compression of airways by the probe, which may impair ventilation;
  - c) circulation arrhythmias that may be induced during probe insertion, mediated by stimulation of the vagus nerve or sympathetic chain;
  - d) trauma to the teeth, pharynx, oesophagus or stomach;
  - e) ischaemic injury which may be caused by pressure and heat generated from the probe;
  - f) bacteraemia.
- The risks are reduced by having a dedicated, trained TOE operator, which also helps to avoid distractions to the anaesthetist from their primary responsibilities.

## 27 **Describe the principles of <sup>a</sup> thromboelastogram (TEG®)**

- A thromboelastogram (TEG®) provides near real-time information about blood clot dynamics (Figure 15), guiding peri-operative management to avoid excessive transfusion and associated complications.
- Heparinase samples distinguish the effects of heparinisation, suggesting protamine rather than coagulation factor use.
- Temperature-adjusted samples differentiate hypothermia-associated coagulopathy.
- A number of quantitative measures are described, including:
  - a) clot time which is denoted by the reaction time (R) that indicates how rapidly a clot is initiated. A prolonged R time suggests hypofibrinogenaemia or deficient clotting factors. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate may improve coagulation;
  - b) clot kinetics which is denoted by the K time and alpha angle (α) that provide a measure of speed of clot propagation. Derangement suggests hypofibrinogenaemia or clotting factor

![](_page_30_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 15. A thromboelastogram (TEG®), where the R time is the period until a clot first starts to form, when the lines begin to separate; the K time is from the end of R time until a 20mm amplitude is reached; the alpha angle is formed between the slope of the two lines (at R and K); MA is the greatest width between the two curves; and LY30 is the percentage change in width during the 30 minutes after MA.**

deficiency. This may be corrected with cryoprecipitate, FFP or a specific factor replacement;

- c) clot strength that is defined by:
  - i) maximum amplitude (MA) which is predominately a marker of platelet function. Reduction in MA suggests platelet transfusion may be required;
  - ii) G which is a global measure of clot elasticity but unhelpful in the choice of treatment product;
  - d) clot lysis which is defined by the markers of fibrinolysis (LY30 and LY60). Values >7.5% suggest antifibrinolytics (such as tranexamic acid or aprotinin) may be required.

#### 28 **What are the advantages and disadvantages of early tracheal extubation following surgery for congenital heart disease?**

• Patients are routinely ventilated following complex cardiac surgery. Prolonged ventilation increases the risk of complications.

- Pulmonary blood flow, particularly passive flow, such as in a Fontan circulation, is determined by the pressure gradient between the pulmonary arteries and capillaries. This is reduced by intermittent positive pressure ventilation and a return to spontaneous ventilation improves pulmonary blood flow and cardiac output.
- Reducing the duration of ventilation is associated with:
  - a) shorter hospital stay;
  - b) increased patient comfort and parental satisfaction;
  - c) early recovery of communication, feeding, bowel function and mobility.
- Prolonged ventilation is associated with complications, including:
  - a) ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP);
  - b) subglottic stenosis;
  - c) adverse events, such as accidental extubation, kinking or obstruction;
  - d) side effects of sedation and neuromuscular blockade, which are necessary to facilitate toleration of the endotracheal tube.
- For some patients, early extubation is inappropriate and a more gradual weaning from mechanical ventilation is required, including in patients with:
  - a) prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time;
  - b) significant inotrope requirement;
  - c) significant comorbidities such as pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, chronic lung disease or liver failure;
  - d) a high risk of TRALI, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multi-organ failure (MOF) — who tolerate reintubation poorly and early extubation may not be helpful.
- 29 **What are the features of an effective handover from anaesthesia to the paediatric intensive care unit team?**
- Although personal styles vary, certain key information must be conveyed in a concise and relevant summary, including:
  - a) basic patient identifiers, including hospital number, date of birth, age and weight;
  - b) diagnostic issues, including underlying condition, pre-operative conditions, previous procedures and allergies;

- c) information on the procedure performed, including repair or palliation, current anatomical and physiological status, presence or absence of residual lesions and their description, relevant information on cardiopulmonary bypass, information regarding the use of blood and blood products, presence or absence of arrhythmias, need for pacing, and position and function of drains;
- d) airway issues:
  - i) ease of mask ventilation and laryngoscopy;
  - ii) endotracheal tube size and depth;
- e) ventilator requirements:
  - i) ventilator mode and airway pressures;
  - ii) oxygen requirement;
  - iii) need for nitric oxide;
- f) circulatory issues:
  - i) site and size of intravascular lines;
  - ii) details of cardiopulmonary bypass, including duration of bypass, cross-clamp and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest;
  - iii) inotrope and pacing requirements, including underlying rhythm and function;
  - iv) use of blood and products and current availability;
  - v) available or outstanding results;
  - vi) use of ultrafiltration;
- g) antibiotics, analgesia and fluids administered;
- h) plans should be discussed, including ideal haemodynamic parameters;
- i) contact details should problems arise.

## 30 **What are the negative effects of poorly controlled postoperative pain?**

- Pain stimulates a neuroendocrine stress response with wide-ranging adverse physiological and emotional consequences. Many effects reflect increased levels of circulating catecholamines, including:
  - a) cardiovascular:
    - i) increased myocardial workload due to increased heart rate, SVR, PVR and oxygen requirements;
    - ii) PVR is increased by raised intrathoracic pressure induced by crying. Shunting may be altered;
  - b) respiratory:
    - i) increased atelectasis, increasing the risk of pneumonia;
    - ii) hypocapnia (and altered PVR) with prolonged crying;

- c) central nervous system:
  - i) aversion to future procedures complicating ongoing care;
  - ii) impaired communication;
- d) general:
  - i) impaired wound healing due to reduced subcutaneous oxygen partial pressure;
  - ii) poor mobilisation, increasing complications and delaying discharge from ICU and hospital.

## 31 **What systems may be used to ensure quality control in anaesthesia services for congenital heart disease?**

- Quality can be defined as "the degree to which health services increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistent with current professional knowledge".
- Assessing quality requires robust, relevant and measurable outcomes. The complexity of healthcare makes this difficult. Currently, popular parameters include outcome data, such as mortality, complications and satisfaction surveys.
- Measuring quality in anaesthesia is challenging. Confounding factors make identifying meaningful measurable metrics, specific to the delivery of anaesthesia, difficult.
- Committing to ongoing quality improvement programmes (QIP) leads to maintenance of high standards. Areas for improvement may be identified from the analysis of adverse events, anecdotal reports or morbidity and mortality reviews.
- Once a problem has been identified, a proposed standard should be defined. Data should be collected defining current practice and suggesting improvements.
- Following any change, the process must be repeated to evaluate impact (Figure 16).
- The QIP cycle may have both positive and negative effects:
  - a) positive such as identify resource deficiencies or educational needs to increase efficiency;
  - b) negative such as frequent changes in practice come at a cost, including staff disengagement.
- The costs and benefits must be balanced. Identifying key improvement areas will yield the greatest benefits.
