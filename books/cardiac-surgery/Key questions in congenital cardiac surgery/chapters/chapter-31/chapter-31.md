### Aortopulmonary window

**Phillip Naimo, Hiroko Asakai, Igor E. Konstantinov**

### 1 **What is aortopulmonary window?**

- Aortopulmonary window is a communication between the ascending aorta and the main pulmonary artery in the presence of two distinct ventriculo-arterial or semilunar valves.
- The presence of two separate semilunar valves distinguishes aortopulmonary window from truncus arteriosus.

### 2 **Describe the embryological formation of the conotruncus**

- From the third week of gestation, the tubular heart elongates and develops alternate dilatations and constrictions forming the sinus venosus, an atrium, a ventricle and the bulbus cordis.
- The bulbus cordis subsequently forms a common outflow tract, the truncus arteriosus. Together, the bulbus cordis and the truncus arteriosus form the conotruncus. The truncus arteriosus extends distally to the margins of the pericardial cavity, where it becomes continuous with the aortic sac.
- As truncal and bulbar ridges develop (Figure 1A), separation of the truncus arteriosus and the ventricles occurs and involves rotation (Figure 1B) of the truncus arteriosus relative to the ventricles. This rotation results in the formation of the great arteries with the blood flow direction in each vessel almost perpendicular to each other (Figure 1C).
- Formation of the conotruncal region is complex. During the fifth week of gestation, active proliferation of a number of mesenchymal cells causes a variety of swellings to develop. Initially, a mesenchymal wedge of tissue develops between the fourth and sixth aortic arches in the roof of the aortic sac. Additional swellings develop in the walls of the bulbus cordis resulting in the formation of bulbar ridges, as well as ridges in the truncus arteriosus (collectively called conotruncal ridges).

**Figure 1. Embryological development of the conotruncal region: A) development and approximation of the bulbar and truncal ridges; B) rotational arrangement of the fused bulbar and truncal ridges; C) final anatomical relationship between the ascending aorta and main pulmonary artery.**

- The conotruncal ridges separating the outflow tract run in a spiral course along the walls of the bulbus cordis and truncus arteriosus rather than running in a straight line. This is required for the right ventricle to connect to the future pulmonary circulation and the left ventricle to connect to the systemic circulation.
- The wedge of tissue between the fourth and sixth aortic arch projects inferiorly towards the conotruncal ridges and fuses with them. Following this, fusion of the spiralled conotruncal ridges occurs, commencing distally and progressing proximally.
- Once fused, this forms the aortopulmonary septum which divides both the bulbus cordis and truncus arteriosus into two separate arterial channels, the pulmonary trunk and the ascending aorta.
- Complete segregation of the right and left ventricles and their respective outflow tracts is only complete when the muscular interventricular septum fuses with the conotruncal septum and the ventricular side of the atrioventricular septum.
- As a result of the spiral course of the ridges, the left and right ventricular outflow tracts and, eventually, the aorta and pulmonary trunk twist around each other in a helical arrangement. The reason for this spiralling is not yet known. Several theories have been proposed, including rotational and torsional forces on the outflow

tract generated as a consequence of cardiac looping and the forces caused by streaming of blood from the ventricles.

- The eventual fate of the embryological truncus arteriosus is that it will be divided to form the proximal portions of the ascending aorta and the pulmonary trunk, while the bulbus cordis will be incorporated as the infundibulum in the right ventricle.
- When partitioning of the truncus arteriosus is nearly complete, the semilunar valves begin to develop from three swellings around the orifices of the pulmonary artery and the ascending aorta, respectively. These swellings are reshaped to form three thin-walled cusps which are completed by the ninth week of gestation.

### 3 **Describe the classification of aortopulmonary window**

- The classification system currently used by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons, as well as the one proposed by the International Congenital Heart Surgery Nomenclature and Database Project, combines the previously described classifications by Mori and Ho (Figure 2):
  - a) Type I (proximal defect) a communicating window located just above the sinus of Valsalva (aortic sinus), a few millimetres above the semilunar valve, with a superior rim but little inferior rim separating the aortopulmonary window from the semilunar valve;
  - b) Type II (distal defect) a communicating window located in the uppermost portion of the ascending aorta, with a well formed inferior rim but little superior rim;
  - c) Type III (total defect) a communicating window involving the majority of the ascending aorta, with little superior or inferior rims;
  - d) Type IV (intermediate defect) a communicating window similar to a total defect but with well-formed superior and inferior rims.
- Richardson proposed a similar classification in 1979 (Figure 3).
- The term 'hemitruncus' is a misnomer as it implies that the anomalous vessel arises from a common arterial trunk, whereas it actually arises from the ascending aorta. In view of this, the term 'hemitruncus' should not be used.
- Instead, this anomaly should be referred to as an anomalous origin of the right pulmonary artery from the ascending aorta with or without concomitant aortopulmonary window (Figure 4).

RPA = right pulmonary artery.**

### 4 What is the epidemiology of aortopulmonary window?

- Aortopulmonary window is a rare congenital cardiac anomaly, accounting for 0.1-0.2% of all cardiac malformations.
- The male-to-female prevalence is approximately 2:1.

### 5 What cardiovascular abnormalities are associated with aortopulmonary window?

 Approximately 25-60% of patients with aortopulmonary window have at least one concomitant cardiovascular anomaly (Table 1).

- The most frequent associations are with patent ductus arteriosus and interrupted aortic arch.
- A proportion of these patients (6-25%) may have aortopulmonary window with patent ductus arteriosus but without an interrupted aortic arch.

• Although the average prevalence of interrupted aortic arch is 21%, it can reach 50% in some series. When present, 85% have a Type A arch lesion and 15% Type B (Figure 5). Interestingly, aortopulmonary window is not particularly prevalent in patients with interrupted aortic arch.

**Figure 5. Appearance of aortopulmonary window (using Richardson's classification) with concomitant Type A or B interrupted aortic arch.**

- Most ventricular septal defects associated with aortopulmonary window are perimembranous in type, with 78% perimembranous and 22% muscular in the Melbourne series.
- Although coronary anomalies are uncommon, the accurate delineation of their anatomy is vital for the successful correction of

aortopulmonary window. In a total of 25 reported cases, the right coronary artery was most commonly involved and mortality associated with these anomalies was 16%. Anomalous arteries tend to arise from the main pulmonary artery or from the aortopulmonary window itself (Figure 6).

C) Anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the main pulmonary artery in the presence of an aortopulmonary window. LCA = left coronary artery; RCA = right coronary artery.

 Less frequent concomitant cardiovascular anomalies include tricuspid atresia, subaortic stenosis, pulmonary artery stenosis, aberrant right or left subclavian artery, and absent left pulmonary artery.

### 6 Which extracardiac anomalies are associated with aortopulmonary window?

- There have been associations of aortopulmonary window to the VATER complex (or VACTERL) which includes vertebral anomalies, imperforate anus, tracheo-oesophageal fistula with oesophageal atresia, cardiac anomalies, renal dysplasia and limb defects. The incidence of this condition in association with aortopulmonary window varies but has been reported between 2-10% (2.3% in the Melbourne series).
- Aortopulmonary window does not seem to be associated with 22q11 anomalies or DiGeorge syndrome.

### 7 **What is the pathophysiology of aortopulmonary window?**

- During gestation, pressures within the aorta and pulmonary artery are equal due to high pulmonary vascular resistance. Therefore, there is minimal flow across the aortopulmonary window.
- Following birth, pulmonary vascular resistance decreases progressively within the first days of life, producing an unrestrictive left-to-right shunt.
- The sustained increase in blood flow within the pulmonary circulation produces severe pulmonary congestion and left heart volume overload, with consequent right and left congestive heart failure.
- The antegrade pressure overload may lead to significant pulmonary vascular changes and pulmonary hypertension, which could become irreversible (Eisenmenger syndrome).

### 8 **What is the natural history of aortopulmonary window?**

- The outcome of unrepaired aortopulmonary window is poor, with approximately 40% mortality within the first year of life that often results from the sequelae of congestive cardiac failure.
- Although small defects may not manifest clinically, aortopulmonary windows do not close or contract over time, therefore progression of disease is likely.
- Progression of the symptoms and the timing of the patient's deterioration depend on the size of the defect and subsequent development of cardiac failure or Eisenmenger syndrome.

### 9 **What are the symptoms of aortopulmonary window?**

- Symptoms depend on the degree of restriction to shunting and the resulting degree of pulmonary overflow and cardiac failure.
- Patients with a small aortopulmonary window may have minimal or no symptoms.
- The defect is often large, however, and patients will typically present within the first weeks of life with symptoms of congestive cardiac failure, including dyspnoea, diaphoresis, poor feeding and failure to thrive. Frequent respiratory infections are common.

### 10 **What are the signs of aortopulmonary window?**

- The physical signs are determined by the size of the defect and the magnitude of the left-to-right shunt.
- Physical examination usually reveals a tachypnoeic infant, using accessory muscles to facilitate respiratory effort and chest wall retraction,

- an enlarged heart with a systolic murmur best heard along the left sternal border and a loud S2 as a result of pulmonary hypertension.
- Cyanosis is usually absent unless there is severe pulmonary vascular disease.

### What are the differential diagnoses of aortopulmonary window?

- Patent ductus arteriosus.
- Large ventricular septal defect.
- Atrioventricular septal defect with a significant ventricular component.
- Persistent truncus arteriosus.
- Ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm.

## 12 What are the electrocardiographic features of aortopulmonary window?

- There are no specific findings on electrocardiogram (ECG) to suggest aortopulmonary window.
- ECG findings may vary depending on the extent of disease progression but generally may demonstrate tachycardia, univentricular or biventricular hypertrophy and signs of atrial enlargement (Figure 7).

### 13 **What are the features of aortopulmonary window on chest radiograph?**

• Patients with aortopulmonary window may demonstrate cardiomegaly, a prominent main pulmonary artery or increased pulmonary vascular markings, due to increased pulmonary blood flow (Figure 8).

![](_page_10_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 8. Chest radiograph of a 5-month-old child with aortopulmonary window demonstrating a prominent pulmonary artery, enlarged heart and congested hilar regions.**

### 14 **What are the echocardiographic features of aortopulmonary window?**

- Foetal echocardiography has become the principal diagnostic tool for aortopulmonary window. It is not uncommon, however, for this anomaly to be overlooked in the presence of other malformations or missed entirely. One reason for underdiagnosis is the over-reliance on Doppler interrogation of a shunt, which can be ineffective in the foetus.
- Diagnosis of aortopulmonary window relies upon recognition of a deficiency between the adjacent walls of the aorta and pulmonary trunk. A combination of multiple echocardiographic views, including praecordial, subcostal and suprasternal, can help to confirm the

diagnosis and minimise inter-technician errors (Figure 9). After birth, the demonstration of a detectable shunt flow is more reliable.

Ao = aorta; MPA = main pulmonary artery.**

- The distance between the semilunar valves and coronary arteries from the proximal end of the defect should be ascertained, as well as the distance between the branch pulmonary artery and the distal end of the aortopulmonary window.
- Other common findings on echocardiography include:
  - a) enlargement of the left and/or right heart chambers;
  - b) increased pulmonary venous return;
  - c) increased flow across the mitral and aortic valves;
  - d) enlarged pulmonary arteries;
  - e) reversal of diastolic flow in the descending aorta;
  - f) prominent pulsatility of the thoracic aorta.

### 15 **Describe the use of other imaging modalities for assessing aortopulmonary window**

- Although computed tomography scanning has a better ability to delineate the great arteries and coronary anatomy than echocardiography, it is seldom required for the diagnosis of aortopulmonary window. It is usually performed to determine the presence of any concomitant cardiac and extracardiac anomalies.
- Cardiac catheterisation is not often performed in cases of aortopulmonary window but may be considered in patients older than 6 months, to evaluate the degree of pulmonary vascular resistance and the degree of reversibility of pulmonary hypertension.

### 16 **What are the therapeutic options for <sup>a</sup> patient with aortopulmonary window?**

- Closure of aortopulmonary window is indicated in all patients and should be undertaken as soon as the diagnosis is made to prevent the development of heart failure or irreversible pulmonary hypertension.
- The only contraindication to surgical closure of an aortopulmonary window is demonstrated irreversible pulmonary hypertension, which may be suspected on the basis of reversal of shunt flow.
- All efforts should be aimed at improving systemic circulation and limiting pulmonary blood flow.
- Patients often present with congestive cardiac failure and failure to thrive, which may require stabilisation with diuretics, anti-failure medications and in some cases, inotropes.
- Intubation may be used, as mechanical ventilation allows for a degree of hyperpnoea, which will increase the pulmonary vascular resistance thereby decreasing the left-to-right shunt and improving the systemic circulation.
- Additionally, for patients with a concomitant interrupted aortic arch, a prostaglandin infusion may be required to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus.
- Although the defect nearly always requires closure by surgical intervention, rarely, it may be closed via a transcatheter approach.

### 17 **What are the principles of surgery for repair of aortopulmonary window?**

• In general, division of the aortopulmonary window and subsequent closure of the aorta and pulmonary artery is performed. Defects in the aorta and pulmonary artery are closed either by direct suture of the defect or by patch repair, when appropriate.

- In patients with concurrent cardiovascular anomalies, single-stage repair of all defects should be performed, as this has been shown to reduce overall mortality.
- Closure of the defect is performed via a median sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass under mild hypothermia.
- Repair for simple aortopulmonary window requires the aortic cannula to be inserted as distally as possible in the ascending aorta so that cross-clamping does not interfere with the repair. Both pulmonary arteries are occluded with tourniquets when cardiopulmonary bypass commences and, if present, the patent ductus arteriosus is ligated.
- In more complex cases, or when interrupted aortic arch is present, institution of bypass will require preparation for deep hypothermic circulation with or without regional perfusion for completion of arch repair, prior to repair of the ascending aorta and aortopulmonary window. Bicaval cannulation will be needed in cases of concomitant intracardiac lesions requiring repair.

The patch on the aorta is fashioned to ensure unobstructed blood flow into the coronary artery. LCA = left coronary artery; RCA = right coronary artery; PA = pulmonary artery.**

- Following infusion of cardioplegic solution, the defect can be repaired via an incision through the window itself, through the aorta or through the pulmonary artery. Most importantly, whatever approach is undertaken, it must provide good visualisation and assessment of the origin of both coronary arteries and the right pulmonary artery.
- The defects in the aorta and pulmonary artery are closed primarily or with a patch, to ensure that the closure does not compromise the coronary arteries or semilunar valves.
- If the coronary artery originates from the pulmonary artery or the aortopulmonary window, repair should leave the coronary artery ostium on the aortic side of repair. With patch closure, placement should be such that the coronary artery is included on the aortic side of the patch. When this is not possible, the coronary artery may be reimplanted directly to aorta (Figure 10).
- Direct ligation of aortopulmonary window is now considered an obsolete procedure and should not be performed.

### 18 **What structures are at risk during surgical repair of aortopulmonary window?**

• The most important structures at risk during repair of aortopulmonary window are the coronary arteries, especially in cases with a proximal aortopulmonary defect (Figure 11).

![](_page_14_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Figure 11. Aortopulmonary window in close proximity to the A) left or B) right coronary artery orifice must be identified prior to closure of the window to ensure that coronary blood flow is not compromised following the repair. LCA = left coronary artery; RCA = right coronary artery.**

- Normally located coronary arteries may be at risk from direct suturing of a proximal defect or from distortion following patch closure.
- The pulmonary and aortic valve leaflets are carefully assessed to avoid distortion and consequent valve dysfunction.
- The ostia of both the right and left pulmonary arteries are at risk of kinking or obstruction, if they are located very close to the defect.
- The conduction system is at risk when closing a concomitant ventricular septal defect.
- When concurrent aortic arch repair is undertaken, care should be taken to avoid damage to the thoracic duct, phrenic nerve or the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

### 19 **What are the complications of surgery following repair of aortopulmonary window?**

- Specific complications following surgical repair of aortopulmonary window are mostly centred on the presence of a residual defect or disruption of normal coronary blood flow.
- Residual lesions will lead to the persistence of a significant shunt, which is generally poorly tolerated in the postoperative period and it often prompts early reintervention.
- Distortion to the coronary arteries can be life-threatening, stressing the importance of intra-operative visualisation of the coronary anatomy.
- Direct suturing of the defect in the aorta or pulmonary artery may lead to aortic or pulmonary artery stenosis, and therefore should be undertaken with care.
- Long-term follow-up of patients is required to monitor for the development of branch pulmonary artery stenosis.

### 20 **What are the risk factors for operative mortality following repair of aortopulmonary window?**

- Surgical repair of simple aortopulmonary window carries excellent outcomes with mortality rates approaching zero.
- Operative mortality may be related to repair of concomitant anomalies or general poor pre-operative state, rather than repair of the lesion per se.
- Interrupted aortic arch has been reported to be an independent risk factor for mortality in patients undergoing repair of aortopulmonary window, with mortality rates ranging from 0% in high-volume highquality centres to 15%.

### 21 **What are the long-term outcomes following surgical repair of aortopulmonary window?**

- Currently, a number of studies report no early or late deaths, if intervention takes place in infancy and with isolated aortopulmonary window repair.
- Mortality of approximately 10-15% was reported for patients with concomitant cardiovascular anomalies, particularly, interrupted aortic arch.
- Over time, mortality after repair of aortopulmonary window and concomitant cardiovascular anomalies has decreased. Prior to 2000, the average mortality was approximately 14% (0-54%), whilst after 2000, the average mortality decreased to approximately 8% (0- 20%). Earlier studies demonstrated higher mortality rates (up to 54%), mainly due to interventions taking place later in infancy and, thus, often in children with irreversible pulmonary hypertension or congestive cardiac failure.
- Late survival is generally excellent with most studies reporting no late deaths after a median follow-up of years. Isolated reports of late mortality have occurred in the setting of persistent pulmonary hypertension. Patients with concomitant interrupted aortic arch have increased long-term mortality with survival of 91%, 86% and 84% at, and 10 years, respectively.
- A number of studies reported no reinterventions for simple aortopulmonary window after a median follow-up of up to 7 years (range 3 months to 25 years).
- Patients with concomitant cardiovascular anomalies have higher rates of reintervention (15-20%), as compared to simple aortopulmonary window. Often these are for aortic arch reinterventions following concurrent repair of an interrupted aortic arch. Approximately 57% of patients with concurrent interrupted aortic arch may require reintervention at 5 years. Of these, 51% required aortic arch reintervention, 6% had pulmonary artery reintervention, and only 43% were alive without any reintervention.

### 22 **What are the principles of device closure for aortopulmonary window?**

• In rare selected patients, aortopulmonary window can be closed using a transcatheter approach. The procedure is limited by a number of factors including the large size of the defect, the small size of the femoral vessels for access, associated cardiovascular anomalies and the fact that the coronary anatomy may be difficult to appreciate prior to closure based solely on echocardiography.

• In a few carefully selected patients, aortopulmonary window has been successfully closed using a double-umbrella occluder system, button device closure or the Amplatzer™ device closure. Echocardiography was used in all of these patients to size the defects prior to intervention. The defects mostly ranged in size between 3-6mm in diameter, with one particularly large window of 8.7mm. Although these defects were successfully closed with no residual leaks, there was limited follow-up beyond 12 months.
