### Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect

**Nigel E. Drury, William J. Brawn**

- 1 **What is pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect?**
- Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (PA-VSD) is a complex, cyanotic and highly heterogeneous malformation of the heart and pulmonary arterial tree.
- It is characterised by underdevelopment of the right ventricular outflow tract (subpulmonary infundibulum) with atresia of the pulmonary valve, a large ventricular septal defect and right ventricular hypertrophy (Figure 1).

**Figure 1. Components of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect. MAPCAs = major aortopulmonary collateral arteries.**

• In its severest form, there is either partial or complete absence of the intrapericardial pulmonary arteries with pulmonary blood flow derived from major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs); although, the presence or absence of MAPCAs is not part of the definition (Figure 2).

**Figure 2. Morphological variants of the intrapericardial pulmonary arteries in pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect: A) normal size pulmonary arteries supplied by the ductus arteriosus, connected by the main pulmonary artery to the right ventricular infundibulum with an atretic pulmonary valve; B) separation of the main pulmonary artery from the right ventricular infundibulum; C) absence of the main pulmonary artery with the ductus arteriosus supplying confluent branch pulmonary arteries but with stenosis at its point of entry; D) hypoplasia of the branch pulmonary arteries with absence of a main pulmonary artery; E) absence of the intrapericardial pulmonary arteries with a fibrous cord connecting the left and right pulmonary arteries at the hilum; F) absence of the intrapericardial pulmonary arteries with major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs) supplying non-confluent (left) and confluent (right) hilar pulmonary arteries.**

- Historically, the marked anatomical variability led to a number of other diagnostic labels, including truncus arteriosus Type IV, absence of the pulmonary artery, absent 6th aortic arch and pseudotruncus.
- The term 'tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia' remains in common use and may be applied to cases where the intracardiac malformation is consistent with tetralogy of Fallot, with or without the presence of MAPCAs.
- PA-VSD is anatomically and functionally distinct from pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA-IVS), in which the right ventricle and tricuspid valve are hypoplastic and coronary sinusoids may be present.

## What is the epidemiology of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect?

- It is a rare congenital malformation accounting for around 2.5% of all congenital heart defects with an incidence of 10 per live births.
- It is slightly more prevalent in males than in females.

### 3 What is the aetiology of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect?

- Genetic including chromosomal defects and recognised syndromes, such as a higher incidence in siblings and children born to those with tetralogy of Fallot.
- Environmental with an increased incidence in maternal diabetes.
- In PA-VSD, the pulmonary ostium becomes atretic early in development, soon after conotruncal partitioning but before closure of the ventricular septum. In contrast, in PA-IVS, the pulmonary atresia occurs much later, after cardiac septation has occurred; hence, consistently these patients have well-developed main and confluent branch pulmonary arteries.

## 4 What abnormalities are associated with pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect?

- Double-outlet right ventricle.
- Transposition of the great arteries.
- Complete atrioventricular septal defect.
- Extracardiac anomalies (in 25% of patients).

- PA-VSD is associated with chromosomal defects and recognised syndromes, including:
  - a) 22q11.2 deletion syndromes (DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome);
  - b) VACTERL association (vertebral anomalies, anal atresia, cardiac defects, tracheoesophageal fistula and/or oesophageal atresia, renal and radial anomalies, and limb defects);
  - c) Alagille syndrome;
  - d) trisomy 21.

#### 5 **How is pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect classified?**

- The Congenital Heart Surgery Nomenclature and Database Project provided a unified approach to classifying PA-VSD into three types according to the origin of the pulmonary blood flow (Figure 3):
  - a) Type A where the intrapericardial pulmonary arteries are present, MAPCAs are absent and the pulmonary blood flow is supplied via the patent ductus arteriosus;

![](_page_3_Picture_10.jpeg)

**Figure 3. Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (PA-VSD) classified according to the origin of the pulmonary blood flow. PA = pulmonary artery; MPA = main pulmonary artery; DA = ductus arteriosus; MAPCAs = major aortopulmonary collateral arteries.**

- b) Type B where both intrapericardial pulmonary arteries and MAPCAs are present, and the pulmonary blood flow originates from both the ductus arteriosus and MAPCAs;
- c) Type C where the intrapericardial pulmonary arteries are absent and the pulmonary blood flow is supplied only by MAPCAs.
- These types are further categorised by the:
  - a) presence or absence of confluent right and left pulmonary arteries;
  - b) presence or absence of a main pulmonary trunk.
- Classification according to the morphology of the pulmonary circulation reflects the implications for surgical management.
- Rarely, MAPCAs can occur in the absence of PA-VSD in patients with severe pulmonary stenosis or pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum. In these cases, the pulmonary circulation resembles that found in Types B and C and the surgical management is similar.

#### 6 **What are major aortopulmonary collateral arteries?**

- MAPCAs are thought to be primitive intersegmental channels with a muscular media layer connecting the systemic and pulmonary circulations, which have failed to involute during development and are present from birth.
- They most commonly arise from the descending thoracic aorta at the level of the carina but also from the subclavian, internal thoracic or intercostal arteries, the abdominal aorta or rarely from a coronary artery.
- They usually have a tortuous course and may pass in front of or behind the oesophagus, tracheobronchial tree and aorta to join the intrapericardial pulmonary arteries in the lung (Figure 4).
- MAPCAs have a highly variable anatomical distribution to lung segments and are associated with abnormal peripheral arborisation of the pulmonary circulation within the lung parenchyma.

**Figure 4. Variable course of the major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs) around mediastinal structures. RPA = right pulmonary artery; SVC = superior vena cava.**

#### 7 **What is the pathophysiology of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect?**

- A relatively large VSD produces complete mixing of blood, cyanosis and equalisation of left and right ventricular pressures with compensatory right ventricular hypertrophy.
- Pulmonary blood flow is invariably derived from the ductus arteriosus, MAPCAs or both.
- In a duct-dependent pulmonary circulation (Type A), closure of the ductus arteriosus leads to hypoxia and cardiovascular collapse.
- In the presence of MAPCAs (Types B/C), pulmonary blood flow is abnormal and precarious. Highly variable anatomical distribution results in simultaneous double supply, over-circulation and hypoperfusion of different lung segments. Progressive focal stenosis or the development of pulmonary vascular occlusive disease and pulmonary hypertension due to unrestricted blood flow may lead to attrition of lung segments over time.

#### 8 **What is the natural history of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect?**

- PA-VSD unrepaired has a poor prognosis, with the greatest attrition during infancy and survival into adult life rare.
- Even with historical surgical management, outlook was poor with ongoing attrition during childhood, and survival at and 35 years reported as 60%, 40% and 6%, respectively.
- Long-term survivors are self-selecting with a well-balanced pulmonary blood flow via MAPCAs, sufficient to reduce hypoxia but restricted enough to limit secondary pulmonary hypertension. They, however, have functional limitation, develop polycythaemia and are prone to infection and secondary pulmonary haemorrhage.

#### 9 **What are the symptoms of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect?**

- Approximately two thirds develop symptoms during infancy.
- Modes of presentation in infants are typically cyanosis (50%), heart failure (25%) or an incidental finding of a heart murmur with mild cyanosis and/or failure to thrive (25%).
- Prenatal or early postnatal diagnosis on screening may avoid an acute, life-threatening presentation.
- Neonates can present acutely with cyanosis, with or without a murmur, especially in Type A as the ductus arteriosus begins to close in a duct-dependent pulmonary circulation without MAPCAs. Severe hypoxia, acidosis and shock ensue as the ductus arteriosus closes. The differential diagnosis includes severe sepsis, other ductdependent congenital heart disease, congenital adrenal hyperplasia and other severe acute illness.
- In infancy in patients with a balanced circulation (Types B/C) with adequate pulmonary blood supply via MAPCAs, they may present with increasing cyanosis as the pulmonary blood flow falls due to the development of progressive stenosis in the MAPCAs or late closure of the ductus arteriosus in Type B. They may also present with heart failure, as the pulmonary blood flow increases with the physiological fall in pulmonary vascular resistance.
- In childhood in patients with a balanced circulation, the presentation is usually with an incidental finding of a murmur, mild cyanosis or heart failure, or failure to thrive.
- Adult patients with unrepaired or palliated PA-VSD are now rare but are ubiquitously cyanotic with dyspnoea and impaired NYHA functional class.

#### 10 **What are the clinical signs of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect?**

- Physical signs are largely determined by the extent of the pulmonary blood flow.
- Acute loss of pulmonary blood flow on closure of the ductus arteriosus results in shock, marked cyanosis unresponsive to oxygen therapy, tachypnoea, tachycardia but preserved peripheral pulses.
- Patients with decreased pulmonary blood flow present with cyanosis, which is often progressive and may lead to clubbing and polycythaemia if it remains untreated during infancy.
- Patients with increased pulmonary blood flow present with signs of heart failure, including respiratory distress, tachypnoea, tachycardia, hepatomegaly and a bounding pulse (caused by a large volume runoff through the MAPCAs or a persistent ductus arteriosus).
- Single loud S2, caused by the absence of the pulmonary component of the 2nd heart sound.
- Continuous bruit, caused by turbulent flow through the MAPCAs or a ductus arteriosus.

#### 11 **What are the electrocardiographic features of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect?**

- Right axis deviation which differentiates it from tricuspid atresia with left superior axis deviation.
- Right ventricular hypertrophy which is demonstrated by a tall R wave (>10mm) in V1 and differentiates it from pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum where the right ventricle is diminutive (Figure 5).

![](_page_7_Figure_12.jpeg)

**Figure 5. Electrocardiogram of a patient with pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect demonstrating right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy.**

- Left atrial enlargement and biventricular hypertrophy which are caused by an increase in pulmonary venous return.
- 12 **What are the radiological features of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect?**
- Chest radiograph (CXR) may demonstrate:
  - a) boot-shaped heart, due to the small or absent left pulmonary artery creating a concavity of the left heart border below the aortic arch, and right ventricular hypertrophy leading to uplifting of the cardiac apex from the dome of the diaphragm (Figure 6);

![](_page_8_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Figure 6. Chest radiograph of a neonate with pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect who required intubation, demonstrating a boot-shaped heart with concavity of the left heart border and uplifting of the cardiac apex.**

- b) right aortic arch (25-50%);
- c) pulmonary vascular markings may be decreased or increased, dependent on the pulmonary blood flow, and have a typical reticular pattern in the presence of MAPCAs.

- Computed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are emerging as alternatives to cardiac catheterisation and may provide:
  - a) anatomical definition of the right ventricular outflow tract, main pulmonary artery, branch pulmonary arteries and stenoses, ductus arteriosus and number, location and course of the MAPCAs;
  - b) functional assessment (MRI) of the percentage of blood flow to each lung;
  - c) 3D reconstruction (CT) of the MAPCAs, which may be useful for operative planning (Figure 7).

#### 13 **What are the echocardiographic features of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect?**

- Echocardiography is the key investigation for determining intracardiac anatomy but has a limited ability to define the nature of the pulmonary circulation.
- Echocardiography can define the pulmonary atresia with absent flow between the right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonary trunk (Figure 8), and its association with a variable degree of hypoplasia of

the subpulmonary infundibulum and main pulmonary artery, ranging from an intact membrane to complete absence of the intrapericardial pulmonary arteries.

- A comprehensive examination will adhere to the standard assessment of the heart and intrapericardial vessels as per segmental anatomical sequence. In particular, echocardiography will provide information on the:
  - a) type of ventricular septal defect:
    - i) large and unrestrictive VSD (often);
    - ii) malalignment VSD;
    - iii) perimembranous VSD with outlet extension (most often);

- b) anterior deviation of the infundibular septum with a varying degree of aortic override in the tetralogy type;
- c) degree of right ventricular hypertrophy and cavity size;
- d) type of interatrial communication and direction of shunt:
  - i) secundum atrial septal defect;
  - ii) patent foramen ovale (50%);
- e) presence of right aortic arch and mirror branching;
- f) anatomy of the coronary arteries, which are usually normal but in some cases, there is an anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the right coronary artery, passing across the right ventricular outflow tract;
- g) anatomy of the intrapericardial pulmonary arteries:
  - i) presence or absence of intrapericardial branching, continuous or contiguous to the ventricular mass;
  - ii) confluent or discontinuous branches;
  - iii) size and possible stenoses of the branches;
- h) direction of the colour Doppler flow in the central pulmonary arteries when detectable:
  - i) antegrade flow coming from the ductus arteriosus (which joins the pulmonary artery in the mediastinum);
  - ii) retrograde flow coming from MAPCAs (which feed into the pulmonary tree at the hilum of the lung).

#### 14 **What are the cardiac catheterisation features of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect?**

- Cardiac catheterisation remains a key investigation for delineating the pulmonary circulation (Figure 9). It provides information on the intrapericardial pulmonary arteries, including the:
  - a) presence of the main pulmonary artery;
  - b) confluence of the left and right pulmonary arteries 'seagull' appearance with diminutive but confluent pulmonary arteries;
  - c) size of vessels and side disparity;
  - d) number of lung segments supplied;
  - e) presence of distal stenoses.
- A retrograde pulmonary vein wedge injection may be required in the presence of hypoplastic intrapericardial pulmonary arteries to demonstrate intrapericardial arborisation within the lung parenchyma.

![](_page_12_Picture_2.jpeg)

**Figure 9. Cardiac catheterisation demonstrating different anatomical presentations of intrapericardial pulmonary arteries: A) diminutive but confluent central pulmonary arteries (white arrow); B) large confluent central pulmonary arteries.**

- Cardiac catheterisation can also provide information regarding any MAPCAs (Figure 10):
  - a) number;
  - b) size of vessels;
  - c) origin from systemic circulation;
  - d) number of lung segments supplied;
  - e) presence of proximal stenoses;

**Figure 10. Cardiac catheterisation demonstrating a large residual MAPCA supplying the right lower lobe on an: A) anteroposterior projection; and B) lateral projection.**

- f) elevated distal pressure (mean >20-25mmHg) suggesting significant pulmonary vascular occlusive disease within the affected lung segments.
- In addition, it can also delineate the coronary anatomy and provide information regarding the pulmonary vascular resistance and transpulmonary gradient. RV pressure is invariably systemic due to the presence of an unrestrictive VSD.

#### 15 **Describe the medical management for <sup>a</sup> patient with pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect**

- Neonates with a duct-dependent pulmonary circulation require prostaglandin E1 to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus until surgical intervention.
- Those presenting acutely with shock following closure of the ductus arteriosus also need immediate resuscitation and may require ventilation.
- Medical treatment with a diuretic and an ACE inhibitor may be required in patients presenting in congestive heart failure due to excessive pulmonary blood flow.

#### 16 **What are the principles of surgical repair of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect?**

- The primary aim of surgery is to improve on the predicted natural history of the disease for each patient.
- Heterogeneity of the condition precludes a standardised approach to all patients, as this is determined by the individual morphology, pathophysiology and presentation.
- The ideal outcome is the creation of a septated biventricular circulation with low pulmonary vascular resistance and low right ventricular pressures. This can be achieved by intervening on all the repairable lesions and malformations of the conditions by:
  - a) increasing pulmonary blood flow, increasing oxygen saturation and encouraging growth of the intrapericardial pulmonary arteries with a:
    - i) systemic-pulmonary shunt;
    - ii) right ventricular-pulmonary artery conduit;
    - iii) aortopulmonary window;

b) early or interval unifocalisation of the MAPCAs to connect as many lung segments as possible to the central pulmonary arteries, thus maximising the size and run-off of the pulmonary vascular bed (Figure 11);

**Figure 11. Cardiac catheterisation demonstrating the variable nature of single and dual supply to different lung segments: A) small but confluent intrapericardial pulmonary arteries supplying most of the right lung (white arrow) and the left lower lobe (green arrow); B) MAPCAs supplying the right lower lobe (white arrow) and the left upper and lower lobes (green arrow).**

- c) securing a long-term source of blood from the right ventricle to the pulmonary tree using, in most cases, a valved conduit, which is preferably oversized;
- d) closing the VSD to prevent shunting, avoid volume overload and prevent or reduce pulmonary hypertension. The VSD should not be closed if a low pulmonary vascular resistance cannot be guaranteed, to avoid acute and chronic right ventricular failure.
- Surgical strategies should aim to minimise the need for surgical or catheter-based reinterventions.
- The approach for achieving these goals remains controversial with different surgical centres pursuing radically different strategies. Long-term outcome data are awaited to determine the optimal approach.

#### 17 **What are the surgical therapeutic options for <sup>a</sup> patient with pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect?**

- Surgical approaches in the absence of MAPCAs (Type A) are normally performed via sternotomy:
  - a) single-stage complete repair which will typically involve a tetralogy-type repair with minor interventions or no interventions on the pulmonary arteries and implantation of a right ventricular-pulmonary artery valved conduit. In some cases, a REV (réparation à l'etage ventriculaire) type repair (patch across the RVOT) can be used. In addition, the VSD is closed;
  - b) staged repair which initially involves a systemic-pulmonary artery shunt to increase intrapericardial pulmonary artery blood flow and encourage growth. Subsequently, the shunt is taken down, a right ventricular-pulmonary artery valved conduit is implanted and the VSD closed.
- Surgical approaches in the presence of MAPCAs (Type B/C) are carried out using a combination of a thoracotomy and sternotomy, including:
  - a) single-stage complete repair which will involve repair of all the lesions in one session, including:
    - i) unifocalisation of MAPCAs;
    - ii) central pulmonary artery augmentation or reconstruction;
    - iii) implantation of a right ventricular-pulmonary artery valved conduit;
    - iv) closure of the VSD; although some authors advocate the measurement of intra-operative pulmonary vascular resistance to determine whether the VSD should be closed;
  - b) staged repair which can be achieved using several different strategies, such as:
    - i) initially, surgical shunt to increase pulmonary artery blood flow and encourage growth of the intrapericardial or reconstructed central pulmonary arteries, or unifocalisation of MAPCAs (ligation in some cases);
    - ii) later, implantation of a right ventricular-pulmonary artery valved conduit, with concurrent or subsequent VSD closure.

#### 18 **What are the key anatomical features to be considered for surgical decision-making in pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect?**

- Suitability of complete repair, including closure of the VSD, is dependent upon adequacy of the pulmonary vascular tree, pulmonary vascular resistance and postoperative RV pressure.
- Size of the intrapericardial pulmonary arteries and the extent of peripheral arborisation.
- Number, origin, course and segments supplied by each MAPCA, may determine the approach, such as sternotomy versus a staged thoracotomy and sternotomy.
- Location of the stenosis within the intrapericardial pulmonary arteries and collaterals.
- Post-stenotic pressure in the collaterals, predictive of subsequent pulmonary vascular resistance.

#### 19 **How is the adequacy of the intrapericardial pulmonary arteries assessed to predict the adequacy of postoperative pulmonary vascular resistance?**

- Although there are several different indices/ratios that can be used, they are all limited as they do not take account of the distal pulmonary vascular bed, which is a key determinant of pulmonary vascular resistance. These ratios and indices include:
  - a) McGoon's ratio = (Proximal RPA diameter + Proximal LPA diameter) Descending aortic diameter above the diaphragm

A ratio >1.2 is adequate for complete repair, whereas <0.8 is deemed inadequate for VSD closure. This ratio, however, may overestimate the adequacy of the pulmonary arteries, as the descending aorta is often smaller in patients with PA-VSD;

b) Nakata index =

(Distal RPA cross-sectional area + Distal LPA cross-sectional area) Body surface area

An index >150mm2/m2 is adequate for complete repair without a shunt. The index, however, is not useful in patients with MAPCAs, as it does not account for unifocalisation;

c) Total NeoPulmonary Artery Index (TNPAI) = Nakata index + Cross-sectional area of significant MAPCAs Body surface area

An index >200mm2/m2 correlates with low postoperative RV pressure.

- Intra-operative functional assessment after completion of unifocalisation and a distal RV-PA conduit can be obtained using a perfusion cannula and pulmonary artery catheter inserted via the conduit and increased up to full flow. If the pulmonary artery pressure remains <25mmHg, the RV/LV pressure ratio is expected to be <0.5 and the VSD may be closed.
- In our practice, recruitment of approximately 15 lung segments is a surrogate marker of acceptable postoperative pulmonary vascular resistance.
- 20 **What are the components of <sup>a</sup> complete repair of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect?**
- A right ventricular-pulmonary artery conduit, such as the de-ringed Hancock® valve conduit, Medtronic Contegra® bovine jugular vein or cryopreserved cadaveric homograft, can be used to connect the right ventricle to the central intrapericardial or reconstructed pulmonary arteries (Figure 12).

**Figure 12. Patch augmentation of the central pulmonary arteries to increase their diameter and enable placement of a valved right ventricle (RV) to pulmonary artery (PA) conduit. RVOT = right ventricular outflow tract; MAPCAs = major aortopulmonary collateral arteries.**

• When the VSD is not closed, surgical clips or bands may be used to prevent pulmonary overflow in the early postoperative period (Figure 13) and subsequently released by balloon angioplasty. In patients with valvular atresia only, a transannular patch repair may be performed.

![](_page_18_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Figure 13. Surgical clipping of the right ventricle (RV) to pulmonary artery (PA) conduit or pulmonary artery banding may be used to prevent pulmonary overflow in the early postoperative period when the ventricular septal defect (VSD) is not closed. RVOT = right ventricular outflow tract; MAPCAs = major aortopulmonary collateral arteries; LPA = left pulmonary artery; RPA = right pulmonary artery.**

• Unifocalisation of MAPCAs — which involves anastomosis of the MAPCAs and intrapericardial pulmonary arteries to form a confluence to receive blood flow from a single source (RV-PA conduit). It is performed either via a median sternotomy, a lateral thoracotomy on the side of the descending thoracic aorta, or both. All identified MAPCAs are ligated at their origin, usually the descending aorta, and extensively mobilised to maximise their length prior to unifocalisation.

- VSD closure is performed using a patch, such as double velour Dacron®, either through the tricuspid valve or via a longitudinal right ventriculotomy, to which the RV-PA conduit can then be anastomosed. If there is concern over the adequacy of the pulmonary vascular bed, the VSD should be left open to decompress the right ventricle and allow time for the pulmonary vascular resistance to fall.
- Other components may include ligation of the ductus arteriosus, take-down of a previous shunt, ASD fenestration or patch augmentation of the pulmonary arteries.
- 21 **What is the rationale for <sup>a</sup> one-stage complete repair strategy for pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect?**
- Early recruitment of as many lung segments as possible to receive low-pressure right ventricular-pulmonary artery blood flow is thought to be a key determinant of long-term survival and functional outcome.
- Early unifocalisation normalises cardiovascular physiology and preserves lung parenchyma by avoiding the development of pulmonary vascular occlusive disease resulting from potentially unrestricted systemic blood flow via MAPCAs.
- Alleviates cyanosis and polycythaemia during infancy and may improve long-term preservation of cardiac function.
- Avoids the risk of interval death due to shunt complications, such as thrombosis and distal anastomosis stenosis.
- Neonates with a duct-dependent pulmonary circulation typically have adequately developed intrapericardial pulmonary arteries without MAPCAs (Type A) and so are good candidates for early repair with an RV-PA conduit and do not require unifocalisation.
- Infants with a collateral pulmonary blood flow (Types B/C) usually undergo complete repair at months of age, after their tolerance of surgery has improved but typically before significant pulmonary vascular occlusive disease or significant MAPCA stenoses have developed. Low systemic oxygen saturations (below 70%) would be an indication for earlier intervention.
- Several groups with large series, including the Stanford group, aim to achieve a one-stage complete repair during infancy in the majority of patients.

### 22 What is the rationale for a staged repair strategy in pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect?

- This strategy has evolved from early surgical experience and divides the complete repair into several less ambitious and potentially better tolerated procedures.
- It avoids neonatal right heart repair, which may be associated with prolonged ICU stay and increased morbidity.
- An initial palliative shunt is performed to augment pulmonary blood flow, relieve cyanosis and encourage pulmonary artery growth.
- A modified Blalock-Taussig shunt or central Melbourne shunt are most commonly used in the presence of confluent pulmonary arteries.
- If the central pulmonary arteries are diminutive, an RV-PA conduit with patch augmentation of intrapericardial pulmonary arteries may be preferred. This also provides catheter access to the distal pulmonary arteries for inter-stage balloon angioplasty of stenoses.
- In the absence of mediastinal pulmonary arteries, bilateral modified Blalock-Taussig shunts may be performed via thoracotomies along with unifocalisation of significant MAPCAs.
- The second stage (3-6 months) typically involves ligation of the MAPCAs to lung segments with a dual blood supply and transplantation only when they are the sole source of blood flow to a segment, free of stenosis and not hypertensive.
- The third stage (1-3 years) involves take-down of the shunt and placement of an RV-PA conduit with or without closure of the VSD.
- The Melbourne group advocates a multi-stage approach without unifocalisation of MAPCAs, instead relying on inter-stage growth of the pulmonary tree with additional patch augmentation of the central and branch pulmonary arteries as required.

## 23 What are the complications following surgical repair of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect?

- Congestive heart failure.
- Complete heart block.
- Infective endocarditis.
- Cerebral abscess, in the presence of a residual VSD.
- Delayed growth.

### 24 What are the outcomes of surgery for pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect?

- Operative mortality for complete repair is as low as 2-6%.
- Single-stage unifocalisation is possible in up to 75% of patients.
- Primary complete intracardiac repair can be achieved in 50% of patients, with delayed VSD closure in most of the remainder.
- Inability to achieve adequate unifocalisation of MAPCAs is associated with reduced survival.
- Intrapericardial pulmonary artery morphology is not a risk factor for survival.
- A multidisciplinary approach between surgeons and interventional cardiologists is essential to anticipate potential problems and perform early reassessment.
- Approximately 30% require early reintervention to the pulmonary arteries and nearly all long-term survivors with an RV-PA conduit will require its replacement.
- Long-term survival after complete repair is up to 85% at 15 years.
- Surgery compares favourably to those with shunt palliation alone (around 55% at 15 years) with impaired functional status.
- Late outcomes include aortic regurgitation and ventricular arrhythmias, which are associated with a higher incidence of sudden death.

### 25 What is the role of catheter reintervention in a patient with pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect?

- Pulmonary artery balloon dilatation or stenting (Figure 14), including surgically inaccessible distal pulmonary artery stenoses.
- Coil occlusion of residual MAPCAs.
- Palliative dilatation or stenting of unrepaired MAPCAs.
- Dilatation or stenting of a RV-PA conduit.
- Balloon dilatation to release restrictive surgical clips or pulmonary artery bands.
- Pacemaker insertion.

### 26 What is the role of surgical reintervention in pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect?

- Complete repair after shunt placement following growth of intrapericardial pulmonary arteries.
- Closure of a residual VSD.
- Replacement of a RV-PA conduit, due to stenosis or being outgrown (Figure 15).
- Pulmonary artery augmentation.
- Recruitment of additional MAPCAs (uncommon).
- Heart-lung transplantation.
