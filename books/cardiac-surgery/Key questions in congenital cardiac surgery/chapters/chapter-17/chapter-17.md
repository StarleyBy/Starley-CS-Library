### Ebstein's anomaly

**Kimberly A. Holst, Joseph A. Dearani**

- 1 **What are the characteristics of Ebstein's anomaly?**
- Ebstein's anomaly (EA) is malformation of the right heart and exemplifies anatomical heterogeneity in congenital heart disease. The classic findings include:
  - a) failure of delamination of the tricuspid valve (TV) leaflets from the underlying right ventricular (RV) myocardium;
  - b) apical (downward) displacement of the functional tricuspid annular hinge points. The displacement is most prominent in

**Figure 1. Ebstein's anomaly. The tricuspid annulus (dashed line) is displaced apically (downwards) and rotated towards the right ventricular outflow tract. This results in an atrialised portion of the right ventricle that lies between the anatomical atrioventricular junction (dotted line) and the tricuspid annulus (dashed line). RA = right atrium; aRV = atrialised right ventricle; TRV = true right ventricle.** *Copyright © Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.*

- the septal leaflet, followed by the posterior leaflet and then the anterior leaflet (Figure 1);
- c) dilatation of the 'atrialised' portion of the RV, with variable degrees of hypertrophy and thinning of the RV wall;
- d) anterior leaflet fenestrations, redundancy and tethering;
- e) right atrioventricular junction dilatation.

### 2 **What is the aetiology of Ebstein's anomaly?**

• Ebstein's anomaly is caused by failure of the tricuspid valve leaflets to delaminate from the underlying RV myocardium and occurs with varying degrees of severity (Figure 2).

**Figure 2. Carpentier's classification of Ebstein's anomaly: A) normal tricuspid valve (TV); B) Type A: adherent septal and posterior leaflets but normal right ventricle (RV); C) Type B: atrialised RV and mobile anterior leaflet; D) Type C: stenotic anterior leaflet; E) Type D: extensive atrialisation of the RV. RA = right atrium; TV = tricuspid valve; RV = right ventricle; RCA = right coronary artery.** *Copyright © Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.*

- Genetic factors are varied and most cases are sporadic.
- 3 **What cardiac abnormalities are commonly associated with Ebstein's anomaly?**
- Interatrial communication patent foramen ovale (PFO) or secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) (80-90%).
- Ventricular septal defect.
- Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction anatomical or functional pulmonary atresia, pulmonic valve stenosis.

- Patent ductus arteriosus.
- Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA).
- Less commonly, left heart abnormalities, including mitral valve prolapse, bicuspid aortic valve or left ventricular non-compaction.

#### 4 What is the epidemiology of Ebstein's anomaly?

- 1% of all congenital heart lesions, approximately 1 in live births.
- Maternal lithium use carries a relative risk of approximately 1.2-7.7 for any congenital heart disease.

#### 5 What is the pathophysiology of Ebstein's anomaly?

- The pathophysiology of Ebstein's anomaly principally relates to dysfunction of right ventricular contractility, secondary to myopathy and enlargement, and tricuspid regurgitation.
- The atrialised portion of the RV separates the true TV annulus from the functional TV annulus. This variably large portion of the posteroseptal wall does not have trabeculae and is functionally associated with the right atrium (RA) rather than the RV, thereby contributing to the paradoxical effect on the tricuspid valve, resulting in increased regurgitation. It may also account for more than half the volume of the RV, thus reducing the true RV volume to the RVOT only, in severe cases.
- Inefficient forward flow further contributes to dilatation of the RA and RV, further dilating the TV annulus, and worsening TV regurgitation.

#### 6 What is the natural history of Ebstein's anomaly?

- Neonates survival is dependent on the severity of presentation but mortality approaches 100% for severely symptomatic neonates.
- Beyond the neonatal period, cumulative survival in non-operated patients at 25 years of age is 89%, 81%, 76%, 53%, and 41% at, and 20 years of follow-up, respectively.
- Predictors of cardiac-related death include:
  - a) cardiothoracic ratio on chest radiograph ≥0.65;
  - b) younger age at diagnosis;
  - c) increased severity of TV displacement;
  - d) cyanosis;
  - e) severe TV regurgitation.

#### What are the symptoms of Ebstein's anomaly?

- Patients with Ebstein's anomaly present with a wide spectrum of symptoms, which are dependent on the degree of anatomical derangement.
- Neonates are frequently severely symptomatic and require intensive care unit level care compared with those who present in childhood or adulthood that commonly have less severe forms of Ebstein's anomaly and may be minimally symptomatic.
- Neonates are usually severely symptomatic with cyanosis or heart failure, and functional or anatomical pulmonary atresia.
- In children, symptomatology is dependent on the degree of heart failure, with most presenting with early fatigue or mild cyanosis.
- Adults may be asymptomatic into adulthood and frequently present with arrhythmia, including atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter or ectopic atrial tachycardia.

# 8 What characteristics on neonatal echocardiography are most associated with perinatal mortality?

- Gestational age <32 weeks at diagnosis (multivariable OR 8.6. p<0.001).</li>
- Pulmonary regurgitation (multivariable OR 2.9, p<0.001).</li>
- Pericardial effusion (multivariable OR 2.5, p=0.04).
- Increased TV annulus diameter z-score (OR 1.3, p=0.001).

### What is the Great Ormond Street Echocardiography (GOSE) score?

• The GOSE score (also known as the Celermajer index) is an echocardiographic score that correlates with the outcome in neonates with Ebstein's anomaly (Figure 3):

GOSE score index = 
$$\frac{\text{Area of (RA + Atrialised RV)}}{\text{Area of (RV + LV + LA)}}$$

RA = right atrium; RV = right ventricle; LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle.

 These values are calculated on the apical four-chamber echocardiographic view in end-diastole.

Figure 3. Apical four-chamber echocardiographic view used to measure the area of the right atrium (RA), atrialized right ventricle (aRV), right ventricle (RV), left atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV).

 As the GOSE score increases, the likelihood of mortality increases (Table 1).

Table 1. Great Ormond Street Echocardiography (GOSE) score and associated risk of mortality in patients with Ebstein's anomaly. RA = right atrium; aRV = atrialised right ventricle; RV = right ventricle; LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle.

| GOSE score | Index RA + aRV / RV + LA + LV | Risk of mortality |
|------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| 1          | <0.5                          | 0%                |
| 2          | 0.5-0.99                      | 10%               |
| 3          |.49                        | 44-100%           |
| 4          | ≥1.50                         | 100%              |

### 10 What are the signs of Ebstein's anomaly beyond the neonatal period?

- Parasternal heave without a thrill.
- Systolic murmur (due to tricuspid regurgitation, where the intensity is dependent on the RV function and severity of TR).
- Splitting of the 1st and 2nd heart sounds.
- Lower extremity oedema in the setting of advanced heart failure.
- Digital clubbing in patients with cyanosis.

### What are the chest radiographical features of Ebstein's anomaly?

 Globular cardiomegaly, secondary to right atrial enlargement and displacement of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) (Figure 4).

![](_page_5_Picture_10.jpeg)

**Figure 4.** Chest radiograph demonstrating cardiomegaly in a child with Ebstein's anomaly.

- Normal or diminished pulmonary vascularity.
- Massive cardiomegaly ('wall-to-wall' heart) with a high cardiothoracic ratio, which may be seen in severely symptomatic neonates (Figure 5).

Chest radiographical images in a neonate with Ebstein's anomaly: A) pre-operative chest radiograph demonstrating massive cardiomegaly (cardiothoracic ratio of 1); and B) postoperative chest radiograph, approximately 1 year following neonatal Ebstein's repair, demonstrating reduced cardiomegaly (cardiothoracic ratio of approximately 0.7).

### 12 What are the echocardiographic features of Ebstein's anomaly?

- Apical displacement of the septal leaflet and/or posterior leaflet of the TV by ≥8mm/m<sup>2</sup> BSA (Figure 6).
- Failure of delamination of the anterosuperior leaflet (Figure 6).
- Severe TR in most cases (Figure 7).
- Possible right-to-left shunt if an intra-atrial communication is present (Figure 7).
- RV enlargement and dysfunction with paradoxical motion of the intraventricular septum.

### What echocardiographic features of Ebstein's anomaly are associated with a successful tricuspid valve repair?

- Large, mobile anterior leaflet with a free leading edge.
- Presence of any inferior leaflet.
- Presence of a septal leaflet.
- A difficult TV repair is more likely in patients with:
  - a) absence of the septal leaflet;
  - b) severe muscularisation of the leaflet tissue;
  - c) adherence of the leaflet edge directly to the underlying myocardium;
  - d) TV leaflet tissue in the RVOT;
  - e) severe RV or TV annular enlargement;
  - f) pulmonary hypertension (which is rare in Ebstein's anomaly).

### 14 What are the radiological features of Ebstein's anomaly?

 Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is typically more useful than computed tomography (CT) in patients with Ebstein's anomaly due to the ability to obtain both functional and anatomical information.

- Axial orientation of MRI images in Ebstein's anomaly help to delineate the atrioventricular junction and attachments of the abnormal tricuspid valve leaflets.
- In addition, MRI is useful in obtaining a quantitative assessment of RV size and function (Figure 8).

![](_page_9_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 8. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in a patient with Ebstein's anomaly: A) short-axis view at the mid-ventricular level; B) four-chamber view; and C) right ventricular inflow-outflow view. The atrialised right ventricle (aRV) lies between the atrioventricular junction (dotted line) and the functional tricuspid valve orifice (dashed line). The functional right ventricle (fRV) is the part of the right ventricle between the functional tricuspid valve orifice and the pulmonary valve. The anatomical right ventricle is a combination of both aRV and fRV. The functional orifice of the tricuspid valve is rotated apically and superiorly toward the right ventricular outflow tract. Ao = aorta; LV = left ventricle; PA = pulmonary artery; RA = right atrium.**

- Stack slices imaging can provide a fairly accurate volumetric assessment of the RV. End-diastolic and end-systolic areas are traced in each slice and multiplied by the slab thickness of the image to generate a volume. The sum of these volumes at all levels gives the total ventricular volume in end-systole and end-diastole, allowing a calculation of ejection fraction.
- RV volume can be determined in two ways:
  - a) anatomical RV volumes where the atrialised RV is included (Mayo Clinic practice). This approach is more able to predict postoperative RV performance, as the atrialised RV is incorporated into the functional RV after TV (cone) repair;
  - b) functional RV volume where the volume of RV between the tricuspid valve and the pulmonary valve is measured, and the atrialised portion of RV is ignored.

- Most adults presenting for surgery have pre-operative end-diastolic RV volumes of 150-250mL/m2. Currently, there is no criteria of RV size or function to trigger referral for surgery.
- TV regurgitation can be quantified by phase contrast (which does not require actual contrast), with a regurgitant fraction >50% categorised as severe.
- Cross-sectional imaging with CT is helpful for planning surgical re-entry and assessment of vessels for possible peripheral cardiopulmonary bypass.

#### 15 **What are the electrocardiographic features of Ebstein's anomaly?**

• ECGs are not necessarily diagnostic of Ebstein's anomaly but are helpful in the identification of arrhythmias and pre-excitation pathways (Figure 9).

![](_page_10_Figure_7.jpeg)

**Figure 9. Electrocardiogram in a patient with Ebstein's anomaly demonstrating right bundle branch block (RBBB).**

- The most common electrocardiographic findings in patients with Ebstein's anomaly include:
  - a) right atrial enlargement and right bundle branch block (RBBB);
  - b) pre-excitation with left bundle branch block (LBBB), with predominant S waves in the right praecordial leads;

- c) low voltage in the right praecordial leads;
- d) supraventricular tachycardia;
- e) prolongation of the PR interval.

#### 16 **Which arrhythmias are common in patients with Ebstein's anomaly?**

- Atrial tachycardia (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter or ectopic atrial tachycardia) occurs in 25-65% of patients.
- Accessory pathways (including Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [Figure 10]) occur in 10-45% of patients, with more than one accessory pathway occurring in 6-36% of patients.

![](_page_11_Figure_8.jpeg)

**Figure 10. Electrocardiogram in a patient with Ebstein's anomaly demonstrating a classic deltawave, characteristic of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.**

- Atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia occurs in 10% of patients.
- 17 **What are the indications for <sup>a</sup> pre-operative electrophysiological study in a patient with Ebstein's anomaly?**
- Evidence of pre-excitation on electrocardiogram.
- History of a supraventricular tachycardia, wide-complex tachycardia or syncope.
- Prior to operative intervention (often in children and usually for adults).

#### 18 **What are the surgical approaches to arrhythmia management?**

• Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or flutter — modified right-sided maze and cavotricuspid isthmus ablation or a selective biatrial maze (Figure 11).

![](_page_12_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Figure 11. Modified right-sided maze and cavotricuspid isthmus cryoablation for atrial flutter/fibrillation. TV = tricuspid valve; AVN = atrioventricular node; CS = coronary sinus; SAN = sinoatrial node; SVC = superior vena cava; FO = foramen ovale; IVC = inferior vena cava.** *Copyright © Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.*

- Continuous atrial fibrillation biatrial maze.
- Cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation or a traditional cut and sew technique may be used.
- In the setting of a previous percutaneous ablation, the maze procedure is limited to avoid the development of heart block, a junctional rhythm or slow sinus rhythm.

### 19 What are the indications for surgical repair in patients with Ebstein's anomaly?

- Neonatal period:
  - a) inability to wean from the ventilator;
  - b) severe heart failure;
  - c) persistent metabolic abnormalities;
  - d) persistent cyanosis;
  - e) prostaglandin dependence;
  - f) GOSE score of with mild cyanosis;
  - g) cardiothoracic ratio >80%.
- After the neonatal period:
  - a) symptoms or deteriorating exercise capacity;
  - b) cyanosis;
  - c) paradoxical embolus;
  - d) progressive RV dilatation or dysfunction.
- If a successful TV repair is likely with low morbidity and mortality, early operative intervention can be considered.
- 20 What are the medical therapies commonly used in neonates presenting with Ebstein's anomaly?
- Prostaglandin E<sub>1</sub>, specifically with functional pulmonary valve atresia.
  It should be discontinued if pulmonary regurgitation develops.
- Nitric oxide to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance.
- Milrinone.
- Endotracheal intubation and ventilation.
- Cautious use of inotropes, such as epinephrine, as this may exacerbate arrhythmias.
- 21 What are the surgical treatment options for neonates presenting with Ebstein's anomaly?
- The choice between a single-ventricle or biventricular repair is dependent on the RV function and the presence of an intact right ventricular outflow tract (Figure 12).

- The single-ventricle repair (RV exclusion, Starnes procedure, Figure 13) includes a:
  - a) TV patch closure (later modified to a fenestrated patch);
  - b) atrial septectomy;
  - c) systemic to PA shunt (typically a modified BT shunt).
- A biventricular repair (Figures 14 and 15) includes a:
  - a) TV repair;
  - b) fenestrated closure of the ASD;
  - c) reduction atrioplasty.
- Postoperative care is similar to other patients with shunt-palliation (single-ventricle repair) or patients with severe RV dysfunction/pulmonary hypertension (biventricular repair).
- Delayed sternal closure is common.
- When operative intervention is required in the neonatal period, early mortality is approximately 25%.

#### 22 **What is the goal of surgical management in patients with Ebstein's anomaly?**

• Repair of the TV.

**Figure 16. Chest radiographical images from a child with Ebstein's anomaly: A) pre-operative radiograph demonstrating marked right atrial enlargement; and B) significant reduction in right atrial size on the postoperative radiograph.**

- Operative repair also generally includes RV plication, right atrial reduction (Figure 16) and closure or subtotal closure of the atrial septum.
- Arrhythmia surgery, as required.

#### 23 **What are the general categories of TV repair in Ebstein's anomaly?**

- Monocusp repair which requires mobilisation of the anterior TV leaflet to coapt with the ventricular septum:
  - a) Danielson method where the TV remains in place in the RV;
  - b) Carpentier method where the anterior leaflet is mobilized, delaminated and reattached to the anterior annulus, followed by plication of the atrialised portion of the RV and ring annuloplasty (Figures 17 and 18).
- Cone repair which consists of delamination and recruitment of all leaflet tissue, followed by rotation and creation of 360° of leaflet tissue with reanchoring at the anatomical annulus.

#### 24 **What are the principles of the cone repair for Ebstein's anomaly (Figures 19 and 20)?**

- Near anatomical repair with 360° of tricuspid valve leaflet tissue.
- Neo-tricuspid valve hinge point at the true tricuspid annulus (atrioventricular junction).
- Selective plication of atrialised RV to eliminate areas of dyskinesis.
- Excision of redundant right atrium.

**Figure 20. Principles of the cone repair technique for Ebstein's anomaly: A) delamination of the tricuspid valve (TV), with the first incision made at 12 o'clock in the anterior leaflet a few millimetres away from the true annulus. Surgical delamination involves the division of the fibrous and muscular attachments between the body of the leaflets and the free wall of the right ventricle (RV). Delamination must continue to all attachments between the atrioventricular (AV) groove and the leading edge of the leaflets (close to the RV apex), whilst keeping the attachments at the leading edge of the leaflet intact; B) following mobilisation of all leaflet tissue, the inferior leaflet, or most medial aspect of the anterior leaflet, is rotated clockwise to meet the mobilised septal leaflet. These leaflets are approximated with a monofilament suture (either continuous or interrupted). At completion, the neo-tricuspid valve orifice should be composed of 360° of leaflet tissue. Prior to reattachment, the atrialised RV is examined to determine the need for RV plication; C) RV plication involves internal triangular plication of portions of the atrialised RV to reduce the tension on the repair, reduce the size of the TV annulus and eliminate the non-contractile parts of the RV. Plication is completed with a or monofilament, starting close to the RV apex and proceeding to the atrioventricular groove. The suture line is partial thickness, primarily incorporating the endocardium. Care must be taken to avoid injury to the right coronary artery; D) attachment of the neo-tricuspid valve to the true annulus, where the septal leaflet is reattached to the ventricular septum (just caudal/on the ventricular side of the true annulus). The repair can be reinforced with either a felt band (in younger children) or an annuloplasty band (in older children and adults).** *Copyright © Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.*

### 25 What are (relative) contraindications to TV repair in Ebstein's anomaly?

- Older patients (>60 years of age).
- Severe RV or TV annular dilatation.
- Pulmonary hypertension (uncommon).

### 26 What are the broad categories of surgical approaches for Ebstein's anomaly outside the neonatal period?

- Biventricular pathway.
- 1.5-ventricle pathway which includes the addition of a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt, and is used for severe RV dilatation or dysfunction.

# 27 What are potential adjunct manoeuvres to facilitate tricuspid valve repair in Ebstein's anomaly?

- TV annuloplasty band or reinforced annular plication.
- Anterior leaflet augmentation with an elliptical patch to increase leaflet height and coaptation (Figure 21) or a triangular patch to

![](_page_23_Picture_12.jpeg)

increase the cone circumference (Figure 22). Autologous pericardium is preferred when available, otherwise artificial patch material may be used.

![](_page_24_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Figure 22. Triangular augmentation of the septal tricuspid valve leaflet to allow for increased tricuspid valve annular circumference***. Copyright © Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.*

- Neo-chordae using either autologous neo-chordae with surgical fenestrations or artificial Gore-Tex® chordae.
- Modified Sebening stitch which approximates the anterior papillary muscle to the ventricular septum.

#### 28 **When is <sup>a</sup> bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt (BCPS) for a 1.5-ventricle pathway more likely to be required?**

- Generally, BCPS should be considered in those with severe right heart failure to allow for RV volume and pressure offloading, as it decreases the volume to the RV by 35-45%.
- Specific indications include:
  - a) RV end-diastolic volume >250mL/m²;
  - b) RV ejection fraction <25%;
  - c) cardiothoracic ratio >65%;

- d) small and D-shaped left ventricle;
- e) post-repair right atrial pressure to left atrial pressure ratio >1.5:1;
- f) post-repair low cardiac output, as evident by failure to separate from cardiopulmonary bypass, persistent metabolic acidosis, low urine output, increasing creatinine, poor peripheral perfusion or low mean arterial blood pressure <50mmHg;
- g) non-heart failure indications include reduction of tension on a complex TV repair and post-repair TV stenosis with a mean gradient >8-10mmHg.
- Contraindications to BCPS include:
  - a) mean pulmonary artery pressure >20mmHg;
  - b) pulmonary arteriolar resistance >4 Woods units;
  - left ventricular end-diastolic pressure or left atrial pressure >12mmHg;
  - d) significant pulmonary artery hypoplasia.

### 29 When should atrial septal defect subclosure or non-closure be considered?

- Residual interatrial communication is an intermediate option to bypass the RV in situations with poor RV function, although this does not provide as significant RV unloading as with BCPS.
- It should be used:
  - a) routinely in the neonate/infant;
  - b) selectively in the child/young adult;
  - c) rarely in the adult, especially when there is an increased risk of paradoxical emboli.

### 30 When should tricuspid valve replacement be considered in the surgical management of Ebstein's anomaly?

- Older patients (>60 years of age).
- Pulmonary hypertension.
- Significant LV dysfunction.
- In these situations, a bioprosthesis is preferred to a mechanical prosthesis due to the good durability of a biological valve in the TV position and as it is associated with less thromboembolic complications.
- The valve suture line is placed on the atrial side of the membranous septum and AV node (generally marked with the vein of D) to avoid conduction injuries. The sutures should be tied with heart beating to readily identify injury to the conduction system (Figure 23).

#### 31 **What are the special considerations for the perioperative care of patients with Ebstein's anomaly?**

- RV preload and RV afterload must be optimised by:
  - a) adjusting intravascular volume using tachycardia (HR 100- 120 with atrial pacing if needed) and relative hypovolaemia (RA pressures <12mmHg), as well as occasionally using postbypass ultrafiltration in patients ≤20kg;
  - b) ventilation by minimising end-expiratory pressure, decreasing mean airway pressure and extubating when metabolic parameters normalise;
  - c) cardiac support using epinephrine and milrinone in the early postoperative period but weaned to avoid potential tachyarrhythmias, and selective use of pulmonary vasodilators (generally for hours);
  - d) prevention of arrhythmias.

#### 32 **What are typical postoperative discharge medications following surgical repair of Ebstein's anomaly?**

- Beta-blocker and/or ACE inhibitor.
- Consideration of sildenafil for weeks in those with severe RV dysfunction or residence at high altitudes.
- Amiodarone which can be used for months if transient atrial or ventricular arrhythmias occurred during hospitalisation, or selectively for months if a large RV plication was performed.
