# Vascular rings and slings

**Harold M. Burkhart, Jess L. Thompson**

# 1 **What is <sup>a</sup> vascular ring?**

- A vascular ring represents an anomaly of the aortic arch and great vessels that encircles the trachea and oesophagus.
- Although asymptomatic rings are more common, symptomatic rings account for 1% of all cardiovascular anomalies.

# 2 **What is the embryological origin of vascular rings?**

- In normal embryology, the:
  - a) left 4th arch becomes the aortic arch;
  - b) right 4th arch contributes to the innominate artery;
  - c) distal left 6th arch becomes the ductus arteriosus;
  - d) proximal 6th arches bilaterally contribute to the proximal branch pulmonary arteries;
  - e) left dorsal aorta becomes the descending thoracic aorta;
  - f) dorsal intersegmental arteries bilaterally become the subclavian arteries.
- Vascular rings are formed when the process of regression and persistence does not occur normally (Figure 1), potentially resulting in vascular encirclement of the trachea and oesophagus.
- A double aortic arch is formed when both the left and right 4th arches, as well as both dorsal aortas, fail to regress and remain present.

#### 3 What is the classification system for vascular rings?

- Double aortic arch (Figure 2).
- Right aortic arch with left ligamentum (Figure 3).

# 4 **What is the most common aortic arch anomaly?**

- Left aortic arch with an aberrant right subclavian artery and left-sided ligamentum is the most common arch anomaly and occurs in 0.5% of the population.
- The right subclavian artery arises from the descending aorta and travels behind the oesophagus to the right upper extremity.
- The majority of individuals with this anomaly are asymptomatic.

# 5 **What are compression syndromes?**

- Compression syndromes represent vascular anomalies where the trachea and oesophagus are compressed by vascular structures but in the absence of a complete ring. They include:
  - a) innominate artery compression;
  - b) pulmonary artery sling (Figure 4).

# 6 What are the most common cardiac anomalies associated with vascular rings and compression anomalies?

- Ventricular septal defect.
- Tetralogy of Fallot.
- Patent ductus arteriosus.
- Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries.
- The overall incidence of associated cardiac anomalies is 10-30%.

#### Which gortic arch is dominant in double gortic arch?

- Right-sided aortic arch in 70-75% of cases.
- Left-sided aortic arch in 20% of cases.
- Codominant in 5-10% of cases.

# 8 Describe the anatomy and origin of a right aortic arch with left ligamentum (Figure 3)

- Persistence of the right 4th aortic arch.
- Regression of the left aortic arch.
- A left-sided ductus or ligamentum arteriosum is required for a complete ring.
- It may be associated with a mirror-image branching or an aberrant left subclavian artery.

#### 9 What is a diverticulum of Kommerell?

- A diverticulum of Kommerell is a remnant of the left 4th aortic arch, located at the base of the left subclavian artery where the ligamentum is attached.
- The diverticulum may become aneurysmal contributing to compressive symptoms.

# 10 What is a pulmonary artery sling?

- A pulmonary artery sling is where the left pulmonary artery arises from the right pulmonary artery.
- It courses from the right pulmonary artery between the trachea and oesophagus to the left lung, thereby compressing the distal trachea or right main stem bronchus (Figure 4).
- A pulmonary artery sling is associated with complete tracheal rings in 50% of cases.

# 11 **What is innominate artery compression syndrome?**

- Innominate artery compression syndrome is caused by an aberrant origin of the innominate artery from the aorta resulting in compression of the anterior trachea.
- Patients with the syndrome may present with stridor, cyanosis or respiratory arrest in infants.
- The compression may be worsened if a large thymus is present.

# 12 **Describe the clinical presentation of patients with <sup>a</sup> vascular sling or ring**

- The most important element of assessment of patients with these lesions is an accurate and complete history.
- Suspicion should be raised in neonates or infants with persistent or chronic respiratory symptoms or feeding issues.
- Respiratory symptoms are often present in the first 6 months and include:
  - a) apnoea;
  - b) respiratory distress;
  - c) stridor;
  - d) cough.
- Gastrointestinal problems can appear early but may persist if early diagnosis is not made. These symptoms include:
  - a) dysphagia;
  - b) oesophageal motility symptoms;
  - c) need for prolonged feeding with processed food;
  - d) regurgitation;
  - e) vomiting.
- The earliest presentation is normally produced by a double aortic arch.
- Occasionally, a combination of respiratory and oesophageal symptoms occur depending on the anomaly.

### 13 **What are the findings on investigation in <sup>a</sup> patient with a vascular sling or ring?**

- A chest radiograph may demonstrate:
  - a) poor delineation of the aortic knuckle;

- b) tracheal narrowing;
- c) hyperinflation of one lung.
- A computed tomography (CT) scan with three-dimensional reconstruction is the investigation of choice to clearly delineate the underlying anatomy and any resultant compression (Figures 5-9).

- Echocardiography is used to rule out associated cardiac anomalies.
- A barium swallow may be required to investigate symptoms of dysphagia (Figure 10).
- Bronchoscopy may be required to investigate patients with suspected airway compression.

# 14 **What are the indications for surgical intervention in <sup>a</sup> patient with a vascular sling or ring?**

- Patients with symptoms of airway or oesophageal compression with anatomical narrowing on imaging.
- Asymptomatic patients with anatomical narrowing >50% on imaging.
- The presence of a pulmonary artery sling also usually dictates surgical intervention.

#### 15 **What are the principles of surgery for <sup>a</sup> double aortic arch?**

- Following left thoracotomy or a video-assisted thoracoscopic approach, the fibrous tissue along the trachea and oesophagus is divided, with the overlying pleura left open.
- Anatomy of the double aortic arch is then identified (Figure 11).
- The non-dominant aortic arch is then divided (Figure 12). Prior to surgical division, it is important to test clamp and confirm appropriate pulses are present.
- The ligamentum arteriosum or patent ductus arteriosus should also be divided (Figure 13).

• A follow up CT scan is indicated to verify the resolution of the anatomical compression, especially if symptoms persist (Figure 14).

#### 16 **What are the principles of surgery for <sup>a</sup> right aortic arch with left ligamentum arteriosum?**

- Following a left thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic approach, the fibrous tissue along the trachea and oesophagus is divided.
- The ligamentum arteriosum or patent ductus arteriosus should be divided and can be sutured to the prevertebral fascia to reduce the risk of recurrence.
- The overlying pleura is left open.
- If a dilated diverticulum of Kommerell is present, it should be resected and the left subclavian artery can be anastomosed to the left common carotid artery.

# 17 **What are the principles of surgery for <sup>a</sup> pulmonary artery sling?**

- The operation is performed via a median sternotomy, usually with cardiopulmonary bypass.
- The left pulmonary artery is divided from the right pulmonary artery.
- The left pulmonary artery is moved anterior to the trachea and reimplanted into the main pulmonary artery.
- In the presence of complete tracheal rings or significant tracheal stenosis, tracheal reconstruction should be performed with a sliding tracheoplasty.

### 18 **What are the principles of surgery for innominate artery compression syndrome?**

- The surgical approach can be a left thoracotomy, right thoracotomy, partial or full median sternotomy, or video-assisted thoracoscopy.
- Following thymectomy, the innominate artery and distal ascending aorta are attached to the posterior sternum.
- Improvement of the tracheal lumen is confirmed with intra-operative bronchoscopy.
- Alternatively, the innominate artery can be translocated to a different location on the ascending aorta to relieve the compression.

# 19 **What are the outcomes following surgical correction of a vascular sling or ring?**

• Surgery for a vascular sling or ring is associated with a low hospital mortality, with the majority of patients experiencing symptomatic improvement.

- Complications following surgery are uncommon but include:
  - a) chylothorax resulting from injury to the thoracic duct;
  - b) diaphragmatic paresis or paralysis secondary to phrenic nerve injury;
  - c) vocal cord paresis or paralysis secondary to recurrent laryngeal nerve injury;
  - d) pneumothorax;
  - e) oesophageal injury.
- Persistent respiratory symptoms and signs may be present, especially in very young infants with severe pre-operative symptoms and tracheomalacia.
- Recurrent symptoms may also be caused by scarring or compression from a dilated Kommerell's diverticulum.
- Catheter-based dilatation of the left pulmonary artery may be required after the repair of a pulmonary artery sling.
