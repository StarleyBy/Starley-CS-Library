#### **Abnormal Depolarization: Wide QRS Complexes and Other Depolarization Abnormalities**

Although a prominent R wave in lead V1 is the easiest depolarization abnormality to quickly identify, obviously there are other QRS abnormalities that should be identified. If the QRS complex in lead V1 is predominantly negative, the three remaining major parameters that have to be evaluated are: QRS width, frontal axis, identifying the presence of abnormal Q waves, and the overall size (voltage) of the QRS complex.

If the QRS is > 0.12 seconds then the ventricles are not being activated simultaneously and it suggests that the two ventricles are not being depolarized by the His Purkinje system in the normal fashion. By far and away the most common cause of a wide QRS complex is abnormal conduction in either the right bundle or the left bundle. As discussed in Chapter 7, in right bundle branch block delayed activation of the right ventricle leads to a late positive force directed toward lead V1 and often results in a triphasic QRS in lead V1 characterized by a large terminal R' wave.

In left bundle branch block, the septum is activated abnormally and more importantly the left ventricle is activated very late (Chapter 7, Figure 7.3). This results in a wide very negative QRS complex in lead V1 A wide negative QRS complex is usually due to late activation of the lateral wall of the left ventricle due to left bundle branch block. Far rarer, a wide negative QRS complex in lead V1 can be due to early depolarization of the right ventricle due to the presence of a right sided accessory pathway (Figure 8.1). Finally, another common cause of a wide negative QRS complex in lead V1 is a pacemaker using a right ventricular lead.

Pacemakers are small, specialized computers/devices that transmit an electrical impulse to the heart via specialized leads. Pacemakers are typically used for the treatment of patients with slow heart rates.

Pacemakers are more comprehensively discussed in Chapter 12, but for this discussion it is important to note that most leads are placed in the right ventricle. With right ventricular pacing, ventricular depolarization travels from right to left and from front to back that does not utilize the

His Purkinje system. For this reason, right ventricular pacing is associated with a wide negative QRS complex.

Once you have established that the QRS is narrow and negative in V, the final things that need to be evaluated are the frontal axis, the presence of any abnormal Q waves, and the relative size of the QRS complex (Table 8.1). As described in Chapter 2, the frontal axis is generally from -35° to -110°. Left axis deviation is present if the axis is more negative (more leftward) than -35° and right axis deviation is present if the axis is more positive (more rightward) than 110°. The most common causes of left axis deviation are left ventricular hypertrophy and left anterior fascicular block. The most common causes of right axis deviation are left posterior fascicular block and right ventricular hypertrophy.

Q waves are any abnormal initial negative deflection in the QRS complex. A QS complex (thus a deep Q wave by definition) is expected in lead aVR and small q waves due to septal activation are expected in  $V_{\epsilon}$  and  $V_{\epsilon}$ . Abnormal Q waves are "plump" (>0.04 s or 1 little box wide) and "deep" (>1mV or 1 little box deep). Q waves can be observed in a number of conditions but where they have been historically important is for the identification of old myocardial infarctions. In a myocardial infarction, absence of depolarization in the affected area leads to net depolarization away from the affected region or a Q wave. Thus Q waves will be present in the leads that overly the affected area, so that in a patient with an old

inferior wall myocardial infarction, Q waves will be present in leads II, III, and aVF. Q waves will also be present in I and aVL in left anterior fascicular block and in II, III, and aVF in left posterior fascicular block. Finally, a Q wave associated with an inverted T wave in lead III and an S wave in lead I has been called the S1Q3T3 pattern and has been linked to pulmonary embolus and right ventricular "strain" or "stress." It is important to keep in mind that abnormal Q waves can be seen in a variety of conditions and simply mean that ventricular depolarization is directed away from that specific lead.

The last depolarization abnormality to be evaluated is QRS size. As in the case of right ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular hypertrophy leads to an increase in QRS size.

## Wide Negative QRS in V1

### Left Bundle Branch Block

![](_page_4_Figure_4.jpeg)

### **Figure 8.2:**

**Background:** Left bundle branch block develops in about 1–2% of people who are followed for 20 years. In the United States left bundle branch block is associated with hypertension and coronary artery disease although worldwide the most common cause has been Chagas disease. **ECG:** Left bundle branch block leads to abnormal activation of the septum and lateral wall and since the left ventricle is not activated over the His Purkinje system, the QRS is wide and deeply negative in lead V1 and positive in lead V6. Notice that left bundle branch block produces characteristic changes in repolarization even in the absence of ischemia. As a general guide, the ST segments and T waves will be in the opposite direction as the main QRS complex: Predominantly negative QRS complexes will be associated

with upsloping ST segment elevation and upright T waves and predominantly positive QRS complexes will have downsloping ST segment depression and inverted T waves. Like many ECG "rules," this one also has many exceptions and should not be considered absolute; the upright T waves in lead II and the lateral leads I, V5, and V6 constitutes a normal finding. Compare this left bundle branch block ECG to the ECG in Chapter 5, Figure 5.4 where the T wave is inverted in aVL. **Clinical Issues:** The left bundle branch is larger than the right bundle so that although isolated left bundle branch without any accompanying cardiac disease has not been associated with a worse prognosis in some large population studies, identification of left bundle branch block requires more detailed evaluation for any cardiac abnormalities.

## Wide Negative QRS in V1

## Right sided accessory pathway

![](_page_6_Figure_4.jpeg)

#### **Figure 8.3:**

**Background:** In the Wolff Parkinson White Syndrome, patients have an accessory pathway that connects the atria and ventricles (Chapter 7, Figures 7.9 and 7.10). **ECG:** In patients with right sided accessory pathways, the right ventricle is activated first at the lateral wall of the tricuspid annulus. This leads to initial depolarization from right to left and a wide negative QS complex is observed in lead V1 and a wide positive QRS complex (usually a monophasic R) in V6. Since the right ventricle is depolarized early, the PR interval is short. Depolarization of the ventricles

in the Wolff Parkinson White Syndrome is from two sourcesthe accessory pathway and the AV node/His Purkinje system. The initial portion of the QRS complex is due to the accessory pathway and is usually called the delta wave. The shape of the delta wave provides a clue for the location of the accessory pathway. In right sided accessory pathways the delta wave is negative in lead aVR because initial ventricular depolarization is directed away from this lead. **Clinical Issues:** Patients with the Wolff Parkinson White Syndrome are at higher risk for tachyarrhythmias.

## Wide Negative QRS in V1

### Right ventricular pacing

![](_page_8_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_8_Figure_5.jpeg)

#### **Figure 8.4:**

**Background:** In many cases the only treatment for bradycardia is implantation of a permanent pacemaker. Since ventricular depolarization is critical for producing effective movement of blood to the systemic circulation a pacing lead in the ventricle is required. Ventricular pacing has traditionally been performed by placing a lead in the right ventricular apex since this chamber can be accessed from the large veins of the body (usually the large vein in the shoulder, and the lead is threaded through the superior *vena cava* through the right atrium and tricuspid valve to the right ventricle).

**ECG:** Ventricular pacing from the right ventricle provides a characteristic QRS complex. Since the right ventricle is activated first, the QRS complex usually has a left bundle

branch morphology pattern (a monophasic QS complex in lead V1). Ventricular pacing can be most easily differentiated from left bundle branch block by identifying the pacemaker spike (the electrical output that depolarized the ventricle). In addition since the pacing lead in often placed in the inferior portion of the right ventricular apex, since depolarization is activated away from the precordium and upward the QRS complexes are often negative in all of the precordial leads V1 through V6 and negative in the inferior leads. Left bundle branch block is not associated with negative QRS complexes in the inferior leads. **Clinical Issues:** Pacing is more comprehensively covered in Chapter 12.

### Q waves Normal Q waves

![](_page_10_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_10_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 8.5:**

**Background:** Small slender Q waves can be observed in some leads. **ECG:** Normal Q waves usually are due to septal depolarization and are usually observed in the lateral precordial leads. Abnormal Q waves represent abnormal initial ventricular depolarization away from a specific lead and must be wider than 0.04 s or 1 "little" box to be considered significant. This criterion only refers to leads in which a Q wave would not be expected. Since ventricular depolarization occurs from right to left, Q waves are always present in aVR and may be observed in lead III. In fact since the identification of Q waves have always implied the presence of abnormal depolarization, traditionally the initial negative deflection in aVR is never referred to as a Q wave. In this example, the arrows show Q

waves in leads II, III, and V6. The Q wave in III is a normal finding and would not be considered abnormal even though it is 0.04 s wide. The Q wave in lead II is not commonly observed but in this case is very narrow and small and is not pathologic. As mentioned earlier, the small q wave in V6 represents normal septal depolarization. A Q wave may also be observed in lead V1 (remember it is contiguous to lead aVR) but any Q wave in lead V2 is abnormal. **Clinical Issues:** Normal Q waves are important to identify and may be confused with pathologic Q waves. In the end it is important to do a comprehensive evaluation in anyone with an "unexpected" Q wave. The differential diagnosis of Q waves is large and a more complete listing is provided in the Appendices (see Chapter 15, Table 15.2).

# Q waves (Left Axis Deviation)

## Left anterior fascicular block

![](_page_12_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_12_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 8.6:**

**Background:** The left bundle divides into multiple branches but generally is considered to have two major branches:-a longer left anterior fascicle and a shorter thicker left posterior fascicle. A block in one of these fascicles will lead to characteristic ECG patterns because of the abnormal activation pattern of the left ventricle.

**ECG:** In left anterior fascicular block there is initial inferior depolarization of the left ventricle (from the left posterior fascicle) but the rest of the left ventricle-lateral wall and anterior wall is activated in an inferior to superior direction. This leads to a characteristic QRS pattern in the frontal leads with left axis deviation and qR complexes in leads I and aVL and rS complexes in the inferior leads. The initial inferiorly directed depolarization produces the small inferior q waves in the lateral leads and the small r waves in the inferior leads. The subsequent inferior to superior depolarization of the majority of the left ventricle leads to large R waves in the lateral leads and deep S waves in the inferior leads. The QRS axis is shifted leftward. Although both −30° and −45° have

been used as "cut-offs" for abnormal left axis deviation, it is important to remember that leftward (more superior) rotation of left ventricular depolarization represents a continuum. In other words although −45° is more abnormal than −30° block in the left anterior fascicle is probably not an "all or none" phenomenon. Like a tree, the left anterior fascicle has many branches and there will be progressively more superior rotation as more branches are lost. The QRS is widened slightly in left anterior fascicular block but since the left and right ventricles are activated simultaneously, the QRS complex is usually < 0.12 s. In this example, the Q waves in I and aVL are less than 0.04 s and would not be considered abnormal. **Clinical Issues:** Isolated left anterior fascicular block in and of itself is of no clinical consequence although one is always concerned that the process that caused the left anterior fascicular block is progressive. Left axis deviation is a common finding, an axis more leftward than −30° will be seen in 2–5% of asymptomatic men.

# Q waves (Right Axis Deviation)

Left posterior fascicular block

![](_page_14_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_14_Figure_5.jpeg)

#### **Figure 8.7:**

**Background:** Probably based on its anatomy (short and stubby), left posterior fascicular block is far less common than left anterior fascicular block. **ECG:** In left posterior fascicular block, initial activation of the ventricles is via the left anterior fascicle with initial activation of the anterior wall and with late activation of the inferior and lateral walls of the left ventricle. The ECG shows right axis deviation and qR complexes in the inferior leads and rS complexes in the lateral leads. Again, although an axis of 120° has been used as a "cut-off" for identifying

abnormal right axis deviation, any axis more rightward than 90° should arouse suspicion. In the precordial leads, there is often a deep S wave in the anterior precordium due to depolarization directed away from the front of the chest. In this example, a Q waves are observed in lead III (normal finding) and aVF (< 0.04 s), but neither would be considered abnormal. **Clinical Issues:** As in left anterior fascicular block, isolated left posterior fascicular block is generally not associated with any specific problems, but is much rarer.

## Q waves (Abnormal)

# Old lateral wall myocardial infarction

III

### **Figure 8.8:**

**Background:** The main reason for identifying abnormal Q waves is that they may represent a sign of an old myocardial infarction. The genesis of Q waves is complicated but they develop in leads that overly damaged myocardium. Scar and a relative reduction in depolarizing myocardial cells result in a net force of depolarization that appears to be directed away from the injured area.

**ECG:** Abnormal Q waves due to a prior myocardial infarction are generally present in regions that are supplied by a specific coronary artery or major branch. A lateral wall myocardial infarction may lead to abnormal Q waves in I, aVL, V5 and V6, while a prior inferior wall myocardial infarction may result in Q waves in the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF). In this example, abnormal Q waves are observed in I, aVL, V5, and V6. Q waves observed in I and aVL may be due to either left anterior fascicular block or a lateral wall

myocardial infarction. In a lateral wall myocardial infarction the axis will be normal or even rightward (due to loss of myocardium) and loss of R waves may be evident in the lateral precordial leads. In this example, there is no R wave in V5 and even in V6 where an R wave is present, the amplitude is extremely attenuated and the axis is extremely rightward with a predominantly positive QRS in aVR. Both of these findings are compelling evidence that the lateral Q waves are due to a prior myocardial infarction. **Clinical Issues:** An old lateral wall myocardial infarction may be associated with heart failure and other symptoms. In particular, lateral wall contraction often provides support to the papillary muscle of the mitral valve. In some cases a lateral wall myocardial infarction can lead to the development of severe mitral regurgitation due to the loss of this support.

## Q waves (Abnormal)

# Old anterior wall myocardial infarction

![](_page_18_Figure_4.jpeg)

#### **Figure 8.9:**

**Background:** Q waves may develop after an anterior wall myocardial infarction. **ECG:** In this case, lead V1 has a normal configuration with a small septal r wave. However, lead V3 is markedly abnormal with a deep Q wave and absence of an R wave. Also notice that there is accompanying ST segment elevation. Notice that the precordial transition where the positive R wave is equal to the negative S wave is lead V5 (or perhaps "V4 and three quarters" since the R wave is slightly larger than the S). The normal R wave transition is V2 through V4 and some have described a late transition zone (V5 or V6) as "Poor R wave Progression." Poor R wave progression may be due to posterior rotation of the heart and can be seen in patients

with left ventricular hypertrophy but can also be due to a relative loss of myocardial mass due to an old anterior wall myocardial infarction. Generally abnormal Q waves, like ST segment changes, are generally present in two contiguous leads. However, in this example, although there may be a small "nubbin" of an R wave in V3 the extremely deep S wave is probably due to an anterior scar and is a Q wave "equivalent." In the anteroseptal leads the Q wave may be observed as a "notch" in the downstroke. The presence of a notch in the initial downstroke is strong evidence that an abnormal Q wave is present. **Clinical Issues:** The presence of an anterior Q wave(s) should always spur additional evaluation.

## Q waves (Abnormal)

## Infiltrative disease (amyloidosis)

![](_page_20_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_20_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 8.10:**

**Background:** Although abnormal Q waves are most often due to a prior myocardial infarction, anterior Q waves may be observed in any condition that leads to loss of myocardium such as amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, or hemachromatosis.

**ECG:** In this example Q waves and accompanying loss of R waves is observed in the anterior leads V2 through V4. Again poor R wave progression is present with a precordial transition between V4 and V5. Although loss of R waves in the anterior precordium (often called "poor R wave progression") may be due to posterior rotation of the heart, the presence of a QS complex in lead V4 is definitely abnormal. Often times, anterior Q waves in the setting of a

prior myocardial infarction are associated with accompanying ST segment elevation due to the formation of a left ventricular aneurysm (Chapter 4, Figure 4.12). In this case the absence of accompanying ST segment elevation suggests an infiltrative disease as the cause for the ECG abnormalities. This patient had amyloidosis, where an abnormal protein called transthyretin is deposited in the heart with loss of myocytes. **Clinical Issues:** By far and away the most common cause of anterior Q waves is coronary artery disease and an old prior myocardial infarction but may be due to other diseases that affect the ventricular myocardium.

Q waves (Abnormal?)

Pulmonary embolus (S1Q3T3)

![](_page_22_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_22_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 8.11:**

**Background:** Pulmonary embolus is a common cause for the sudden development of chest pain. This diagnosis is generally made by tests other than the ECG. **ECG:** The most common finding on ECG is simple increased heart rate due to generalized sympathetic activation in response to the hypoxia due to the pulmonary embolus. One ECG pattern that has been associated with pulmonary embolus is the S1Q3T3 pattern that is characterized by an S wave in lead I, and a Q wave and an inverted T wave in lead III. The depolarization pattern is thought to be due to a more rightward orientation of the frontal axis. The T wave inversion is thought to be due to hypoxia. In this example of a patient with a proven large pulmonary embolus, a deep S

wave is noted in I, and a deep Q wave in lead III. The T wave is upright but there is some very subtle ST segment depression. **Clinical Issues:** Pulmonary embolus (usually due to a blood clot that has broken off from a clot in the leg and traveled to the pulmonary arteries) should be in the differential diagnosis of anyone complaining of sudden onset of chest pain particularly with associated shortness of breath. Although the S1Q3T3 pattern is more commonly observed in pulmonary embolus and should arouse suspicion if present, in general the ECG has very little, if any, use for the identification of pulmonary embolus.

### Prominent Voltage

## Left ventricular hypertrophy (aVL)

![](_page_24_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_24_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 8.12:**

**Background:** One of the principal problems associated with hypertension is the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. Thickening of the left ventricle is a way for the heart to respond to contracting against higher pressures (also called higher afterload) in hypertension.

**ECG:** Left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with both depolarization and repolarization changes. Since the left ventricle is larger and thicker, the voltages measured on the ECG are usually larger. Abnormal depolarization leads to abnormal repolarization most often associated with lateral

ST depression and T wave inversion. One of the oldest criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy is an R wave > 11 mm in lead aVL, as shown in this example. **Clinical Issues:** Identification of ECG criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy should spur further cardiac evaluation. Often an echocardiogram is required to evaluate the severity of left ventricular hypertrophy and rule out any valvular causes of left ventricular hypertrophy, such as aortic valve stenosis.

### **Prominent Voltage**

# Left ventricular hypertrophy (V1, V6)

![](_page_26_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 8.13:**

**Background:** Since identification of left ventricular hypertrophy can be an important clinical issue, several different criteria for identification of left ventricular hypertrophy have been developed. **ECG:** In addition to a large R wave in aVL, large voltages in the precordial leads have also been used as criteria for identification of left ventricular hypertrophy. If the sum of

the voltage of the S wave in V1 and the R wave in V6 is > 35 mm, left ventricular hypertrophy is present. **Clinical Issues:** The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG in a patient with hypertension is evidence that the hypertension is significant and probably has not been optimally controlled.

In the most commonly used system, named the Romhilt Estes criteria for the two investigators who initially described the method, points are awarded for different

depression and T wave inversion) or a left atrial abnormality. The presence of left atrial abnormality suggests that the left atrium has enlarged/thickened in response to contracting against a thick left ventricle. The Romhilt Estes point system is summarized in in the Appendices (see Table 15.4). It is difficult to remember all of the points for each of the specific ECG findings but from a practical standpoint, a patient has left ventricular hypertrophy if both left atrial abnormality and repolarization abnormalities are present.
