#### **CHAPTER 4**

#### **Abnormal Repolarization: ST Segment Elevation**

You have come to this chapter in two ways. Either you identified ST segments that are not isoelectric or you have identified abnormal T waves (Figure 4.1). The ST segment and the T wave correlate with the plateau phase and repolarization of ventricular myocytes respectively and are particularly important for evaluation of the patient with chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of myocardial injury/ ischemia (ischemia means that an organ is not receiving adequate amounts of blood and comes from the Greek word *iskhaimos*: *iskhein*: "To hold back" and *haima*: "blood"). It is important to remember that all three of these repolarization changes (ST segment elevation, ST segment depression, and T wave changes) can sometimes be observed on a single ECG and are often related. Clinically ST segment elevation requires the most urgent treatment and should always be the primary focus of the evaluation. In other words, the leads that display ST segment elevation directs you to the location and type of problem ("Where the money is"). If the ECG has ST segment elevation, use the figures in this chapter to help you with the diagnosis. If the ECG has ST depression only, recheck to make sure there are no leads with ST elevation and go to Chapter 5, and if the ST segments are isoelectric and only the T waves are inverted, go to Chapter 6. Very subtle ST segment elevation can be a normal finding in any lead, particularly in V2 and V3 . However, any ST segment elevation > 2 mm in leads V2 or V3 or ST segment elevation > 1 mm in any of the other leads should be considered suspicious for a cardiac abnormality. Use Table 4.1 to decide whether: 1) The ST segment elevation is abnormal? and 2) Is the abnormal ST segment elevation due to myocardial injury?

Evaluation of abnormal repolarization. If ST segment elevation is present the specific lead location(s) of the ST segment elevation should be identified. ST segment elevation associated with myocardial infarction is localized to one of the regions supplied by the major coronary arteries (see Figure 4.3). In addition to the localization of the ST segment elevation to a particular region supplied by a coronary artery, the presence of ST segment depression in other leads (so called reciprocal ST segment depression) or Q waves suggests myocardial injury as the cause of the ST segment elevation. Other repolarization abnormalities include ST segment depression (usually seen in the lateral leads), or abnormal T waves (See Chapters 5 and 6).

**Table 4.1:** Factors determining whether abnormal ST segment is present and whether abnormal ST segment elevation is more likely due to ischemia

#### **Is abnormal ST segment elevation present?**

(*Yes to any questions means abnormal* )

- Is ST segment elevation > 2 mm in V2 and V3 , or > 1 mm in the other leads?
- Is the ST segment elevation present in two "adjacent" (contiguous) leads?

#### **Is the abnormal ST segment elevation due to myocardial injury?**

(*Yes to any questions means that myocardial injury is a likely cause*)

- Does the ST segment elevation correspond to a region supplied by a coronary artery (anterior, lateral, inferior)?
- Is reciprocal ST segment depression present?
- Are the T waves also inverted?
- Are Q waves present?

ST segment elevation is the hallmark ECG finding for patients who have total occlusion of one of the major coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart (Figure 4.2). In this case continued myocardial injury can lead to myocardial infarction (MI)-more commonly called a "heart attack." (The word infarction comes from the Latin word "*infarcire*" which means to "plug up.") The main reason for quickly identifying the presence of ST segment elevation is that several landmark studies have demonstrated the importance of reestablishing blood flow via either drugs to dissolve the clot (thrombolysis) or mechanically opening the artery (usually by taking the patient directly to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where cardiologists can restore blood flow with a variety of special techniques including balloons that dilate the narrowed area). In fact the data is so compelling for STEMI or "ST segment elevation myocardial infarction," hospitals in the United States are now being "graded" on the timeliness and their response to this condition. Myocardial infarction can also occur in the setting of ST segment depression and T wave changes (usually T wave inversion), and the clinical term for these conditions is NSTEMI or "non ST segment elevation myocardial infarction." The terms ischemia, injury, and infarction have traditionally been used to distinguish increasing degrees of severity based on ECG findings. "Ischemia" was characterized by ST segment depression

#### **Figure 4.2:**

Schematic for the development of myocardial ischemia/injury/ infarction. A lipid plaque ruptures and thrombus (blood clot) forms at the exposed tissue/lipid. If the thrombus completely occludes flow, the patient develops a myocardial infarction (usually characterized by ST segment elevation) in the downstream myocardium (shaded area). Sometimes the clot does not completely occlude blood flow, but severe limitation of flow prevents sufficient blood to be supplied to the affected area (ischemia).

or T wave changes, "Injury" was characterized by ST segment elevation without Q waves, and "Infarction" characterized by abnormal Q waves and ST segment elevation or depression. Now the diagnosis of myocardial damage is generally made by identifying abnormal amounts of cardiac proteins such as troponins in the blood. But the ECG is still used to distinguish myocardial infarctions associated with ST segment elevation (STEMI) and myocardial infarctions with any other ECG findings (NSTEMI).

One of the important hallmarks of ST segment elevation associated with a MI is localization of the ST segment elevation to a specific anatomic distribution. In most people there are three major coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart (Figure 4.3). The right coronary artery supplies blood to the inferior wall. The left main coronary artery almost immediately (usually within 1 or 2 cm) splits into a left anterior descending coronary artery supplies blood to the anterior wall, and a circumflex coronary artery supplies blood to the lateral wall. Complete occlusion of a coronary artery will generally lead to ST segment elevation in the leads that "look" directly at these areas. In many cases "reciprocal" ST depression will be observed in the other leads. The presence of a Q wave (initial negative deflection in the QRS complex) in a lead with ST segment elevation is very suggestive that a myocardial infarction is present.

As will be illustrated in the rest of the chapter, MI is associated with ST segment elevation in groups of leads (anterior: V1 to V4 ; inferior: II, III, and aVF; lateral: I, aVL, V5 and V6 ), depending on the site and extent of injury. As a corollary to this point, ST segment elevation due to myocardial infarction should be observed in several leads within a given lead group. Another commonly used way of emphasizing this important point is that significant ST segment elevation should be observed in two contiguous leads (leads that are roughly adjacent to each other). For further evaluation of ST segment elevation, it is easiest to consider the location (s) of the ST elevation: precordial (anterior and lateral), Inferior, both precordial and inferior, and only in aVR.

One specific point about anterior ST segment elevation requires special emphasis. Anterior ST segment elevation, particularly in leads V1 through V3 , can be present in almost any condition that is associated with a wide negative QRS complex in lead V1 . The most common example is left bundle branch block. The specific ECG characteristics of conditions associated with a wide QRS complex are covered more extensively in Chapter 7, but in general anything that causes abnormal ventricular depolarization will cause abnormal repolarization including changes in the ST segment that can make evaluation of ST segments extremely problematic and often useless. As always the clinician should make decisions based on the patient's symptoms and "Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst."

#### **Figure 4.3:**

Localization of ST segment elevation in relationship to the affected coronary artery that is occluded. If the left anterior descending artery is occluded ST segment elevation is usually seen in the anterior leads V1 –V4 . In most people the circumflex artery often has one or two large obtuse marginal arteries and occlusion of one of these arteries leads to a

lateral wall myocardial infarction. ST segment elevation is usually seen in the lateral leads I, aVL, V5 , and V6 . The right coronary artery supplies the inferior wall in most people, so that occlusion leads to an inferior wall myocardial infarction. ST segment elevation is observed in the inferior leads II, III, and aVF.

#### **Figure 4.4:**

young men but is usually less than 2 mm. The ST segment

When precordial ST segment elevation is observed it is extremely useful to 1) look specifically at V1 and 2) evaluate the specific precordial leads that have ST segment elevation. If the QRS in lead V1 is wide and predominantly negative left bundle branch block may be present and accompanying ST segment elevation is very common. In fact ECG identification of myocardial infarction in the presence of left bundle branch block can be extremely problematic (Figure 4.27). A much rarer finding is the presence of Brugada Syndrome that is characterized by a terminal positive deflection (r' wave) and ST segment elevation in V1 (Figures 4.15 and 4.16). In situations where the ST segment elevation is only present in the anterior leads (V1 through V4) the differential diagnosis is generally fairly limited. Isolated ST segment elevation in V1 through V3 can be seen as a normal variant, particularly in

elevation associated with an anterior wall myocardial infarction may be extremely prominent, sometimes > 5 mm and has often been described as having a "humped" shape and may obscure even large T waves. The presence of a Q wave (initial negative deflection or notch) in any of the anterior leads V1–V4 is abnormal and is evidence for a myocardial infarction. ST segment elevation in the lateral precordial leads V5 and V6 are associated with some additional possibilities. A specific pattern called early repolarization (Figure 4.6) is associated with lateral ST segment elevation and prominent T waves and is particularly common in African American men. In addition, pericarditis (Figure 4.21) a condition where there is acute inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart can also cause ST segment elevation.

# Precordial ST Segment Elevation

"Normal" ST segment elevation Not due to myocardial Injury

![](_page_9_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_9_Figure_5.jpeg)

#### **Figure 4.5:**

**Background:** Precordial ST segment elevation may be observed, particularly in young men. **ECG:** Anterior ST segment elevation < 2 mm in leads V2 or V3 (< 2.5 mm in men younger than 40 years old) may be a normal finding. "Normal" ST segment elevation will not be

associated with abnormal Q waves and reciprocal ST segment depression will not be observed. **Clinical Issues:** The presence of "normal" ST segment elevation does not change clinical prognosis.

# Precordial ST Segment Elevation

"Normal" ST segment elevation due to early repolarization

![](_page_11_Figure_4.jpeg)

#### **Figure 4.6:**

**Background:** This is a normal variant in young men, particularly African Americans. **ECG:** The ST changes are most prominent in the anteriolateral leads. The J point (the junction between the QRS and the ST segment) will be elevated > 1 mm in at least 2 of the right precordial leads in 90% of young men. The ST segment will have a concave upward, slightly sagging appearance between the J point and the T wave, usually in the precordial leads V2 to V6. It is often greatest in V4. The ST segment elevation ranges from 0.5 mm to 5 mm, but it is usually < 2 mm in the precordial leads and < 0.5 mm in the

limb leads. A notch (or hook) at the terminal portion of the QRS complex is frequently observed and Q waves are not present. **Clinical Issues:** Early repolarization is usually benign, but there are some small studies that suggest that early repolarization may be slightly more common in patients with sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmias when compared to the general population. Currently there are no tests that can be used to identify the very small group of patients with early repolarization who may be at higher risk.

![](_page_13_Figure_4.jpeg)

#### **Figure 4.7:**

**Background:** Almost any condition that is associated with abnormal depolarization can be associated with minor ST segment changes. **ECG:** In this example of a patient with abnormal conduction in his bundles (right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block) ST segment elevation is observed in V2 and V3. When abnormal depolarization due to bundle branch

block is present ST segment elevation may be observed in any lead where the QRS is entirely negative, or as in this case, where the terminal portion of the QRS is negative). **Clinical Issues:** No specific treatment for the ST segment changes is required although the presence of bundle branch block can be associated with an increased risk of future problems with bradycardia.

## Precordial ST Segment Elevation

### Anterior Wall Myocardial Infarction

![](_page_15_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_15_Figure_5.jpeg)

#### **Figure 4.8:**

**Background:** Occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery can cause a number of different patterns of ST segment elevation depending on the site of occlusion and the patient's individual anatomy. Although most people have three major arteries, the branching pattern of smaller arteries from these major branches can vary significantly from person to person.

**ECG:** An anterior wall myocardial infarction is associated with ST segment elevation in the precordial leads, usually most prominent in V2 through V4. There should be ST segment elevation in 2 adjacent anterior leads in order to make the diagnosis of Anterior MI. In this case ST segment elevation is also seen in V5 and subtle ST segment elevation is also present in the lateral leads I and aVL. In general, for any type of myocardial infarction the extent of ST segment elevation provides a clue on the size of the myocardial

infarction: More leads with ST segment elevation = Larger myocardial infarction. The presence of a Q wave in the anterior leads is abnormal and is very strong evidence for a myocardial infarction. In some cases, particularly early in the course of a myocardial infarction Q waves will not be observed. In this example abnormal Q waves in V1 to V5 and aVL are present. A slender Q wave is noted in V6 but since it is less than 1 mm wide it is not considered significant. From a clinical standpoint though, whether 6 or 7 Q waves are present makes little difference. **Clinical Issues:** The anterior wall is the most important of the three regions (anterior, inferior, and lateral) of the left ventricle and anterior wall myocardial infarctions are associated with increased risk of death and heart failure when compared to inferior wall and lateral wall myocardial infarctions.

# Precordial ST Segment Elevation

### Anterior Wall Myocardial Infarction (with Right Bundle Branch Block)

![](_page_17_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_17_Figure_5.jpeg)

#### **Figure 4.9:**

**Background:** Conduction abnormalities may be seen in the setting of an anterior wall myocardial infarction. One of the earliest branches of the left anterior descending artery is the "first septal perforator" that "dives" into the septum and provides blood to the right bundle branch and the left anterior fascicle.

**ECG:** The ECG for this anterior wall myocardial infarction is different than the example in Figure 4.7. Both are associated with ST segment elevation in leads V2 through V4. In this example ST segment elevation is not present in the lateral precordium in leads V5 and V6 but prominent ST segment elevation is noted in I and aVL. Profound "reciprocal" ST segment depression is noted in the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF). The exact mechanism for reciprocal ST depression is not well understood, but from an ECG analysis standpoint the presence of "reciprocal" changes in the inferior leads is very strong evidence for cardiac injury. In this example abnormal Q waves are present in V1 and V2. The final

difference between Figures 4.7 and 4.8 is the QRS complex in V1. In this example it is wide (0.16 s) and predominantly positive. This patient has right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block, problems that are introduced in Chapters 7 and 9. Compare this ECG and the ECG in Figure 4.7. Myocardial injury is associated with more prominent ST segment elevation, inferior reciprocal ST segment depression and Q waves. In fact, of all the ECG parameters, accompanying reciprocal ST depression is the best clue for deciding that ST segment elevation is due to myocardial injury. **Clinical Issues:** As in Figure 4.7, the presence of an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction requires rapid identification and an attempt to restore blood flow to the myocardium at risk. In many cases this will involve transporting the patient to the catheterization laboratory for revascularization (angioplasty or stent) but could also require the use of powerful "clot buster" medications if necessary.

# Precordial ST Segment Elevation

### Anterior Wall Myocardial Infarction (with lateral extension)

![](_page_19_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_19_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 4.10:**

**Background:** An anterolateral myocardial infarction can be due to occlusion of the left anterior descending, occlusion of a large diagonal branch, or a coronary artery that arises when the left anterior descending artery and the circumflex coronary artery branch. This artery is called a *ramus intermedius* and in this case instead of bifurcating the left main coronary artery trifurcates with the *ramus intermedius* forming the "middle tine of the fork."

**ECG:** In an anterolateral myocardial infarction ST segment elevation is usually not observed in V1 and V2 but rather

extends more laterally to V5 and in some cases V6. In this example ST segment elevation is observed in V3 through V6 but the "high lateral" leads I and aVL do not have ST segment elevation. No reciprocal ST segment depression is present in this example and there are no Q waves. However, notice that there is no R wave even in lead V4. This late transition is sometimes called "poor R wave progression" and is considered by some to be equivalent to a Q wave. **Clinical Issues:** Again as in any STEMI, urgent attempts at reestablishing blood flow to the myocardium at risk are critical.

# Precordial ST Segment Elevation

### Anterior Wall Myocardial Infarction (LARGE with lateral extension)

![](_page_21_Figure_4.jpeg)

### **Figure 4.11:**

**Background:** The specific leads with ST segment elevation will depend on the exact location of the blockage and the branches from the occluded artery. In general the more widespread the ST segment elevation, the more proximal ("upstream") the blockage, the more branches, and the larger the area at risk.

**ECG:** In this example marked ST segment elevation is observed in V2 through V5 and I and aVL. In particular, the ST segment elevation in V4 is extremely prominent: The ST segment is 23 mm tall and taller than the QRS in that lead. Very prominent ST segment elevation is observed early during a myocardial infarction and has been given the name

"tombstones" by morbidly creative clinicians to emphasize the seriousness of this condition. Notice that since the ECG is recorded early in the myocardial infarction process the only abnormal Q wave is recorded in aVL and no Q waves are present in the precordial leads. Sometimes the ST segment can be hard to separate from the QRS complex. In this case the downsloping ST segment elevation in I and aVL could be mistaken as a widened QRS complex. **Clinical Issues:** Patients with larger myocardial infarctions, if left untreated, have a very high future risk of sudden cardiac death and progressive heart failure.

# Precordial ST Segment Elevatation

### Left Ventricular Aneurysm

![](_page_23_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_23_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 4.12:**

**Background:** A left ventricular aneurysm is a defined area of the left ventricle that, instead of contracting, moves outward with systole. The most common cause of a left ventricular aneurysm is replacement of normal contracting myocardium with scar tissue due to a prior myocardial infarction. Anterior wall myocardial infarctions due to occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery are the most common cause of left ventricular aneurysms. The development of a left ventricular aneurysm after myocardial infarction is usually recognized 2–6 weeks after the acute event.

**ECG:** Persistent ST segment elevation in anterior leads that does not resolve in 2 weeks after a myocardial infarction should raise suspicion of a left ventricular aneurysm. The ST segment is elevation is dome shaped, accompanied by T

wave inversion and Q waves and is most commonly observed in V3 and V4. Notice that unlike some of the examples of myocardial injury reciprocal ST segment changes are absent. **Clinical Issues:** In general, ECG changes due to left ventricular aneurysm are identified by persistent ST segment changes and Q waves long after (weeks) any symptoms from the acute myocardial infarction have resolved. Patients with a left ventricular aneurysm are more susceptible to the development of congestive heart failure and ventricular arrhythmias. To reduce the likelihood of left ventricular aneurysm formation it is important to treat patients with drugs that lower blood pressues (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) that will in turn reduce the amount of stress on the left ventricle (lower resistance that the heart must "pump against").

# Precordial ST Segment Elevation

### Apical Ballooning Syndrome

![](_page_25_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_25_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 4.13:**

**Background:** This is a syndrome (a syndrome is a collection of clinical findings that does not have a defined mechanism) of transient ballooning of the apical region of the left ventricle that is not associated with coronary artery occlusion. The apical ballooning is characterized by a thin neck with a large "outpouching" of the distal ventricle. It is more commonly observed in women who have experienced a sudden adrenergic surge. The name "Takotsubo" is derived from the Japanese word that means "octopus pot" that describes a narrow-necked vessel that is used to trap octopi (octopi can crawl into the pot but cannot get out).

**ECG:** Anterior ST segment elevation similar to occlusion of the LAD artery is observed. Q waves can also be present. Over time, the ECG will return to normal or near normal as the left ventricular function returns to normal. In this ECG upsloping ST segment elevation is observed in V3–V5. **Clinical Issues:** There may be large areas of the apex that do not contract normally and cardiac enzymes may be elevated. Over time, left ventricular function and shape returns to normal. Patients that develop apical ballooning syndrome once are probably at higher risk of developing this problem again in settings associated with significant stress.

# Precordial ST Segment Elevation

### Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

![](_page_27_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_27_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 4.14:**

**Background:** Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a hereditary disease characterized by abnormal thickening of the left ventricle. In most cases the thickening is generalized throughout the entire ventricle but in some cases the thickening is more prominent in specific regions such as the interventricular septum or the apex.

**ECG:** The ECG in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can have many different presentations based on the location, extent, and magnitude of the left ventricular hypertrophy (Chapter 5, Figure 5.7). For the purposes of this discussion on ST segment changes, abnormal patterns of left ventricular depolarization can lead to anterior ST segment elevation.

The ST segment elevation is usually observed in leads with large QRS complexes and terminal S waves and is usually associated with prominent T waves (V2 and V3 in this example). **Clinical Issues:** Most of the genetic abnormalities associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are mutations that affect proteins of the sarcomere (the contractile unit within cardiac cells). Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can have shortness of breath due to inefficient filling of the left ventricle and pulmonary congestion. In addition, patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are susceptible to ventricular arrhythmias and in some cases an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) is required.

Precordial ST Segment Elevation

![](_page_29_Figure_3.jpeg)

![](_page_29_Figure_4.jpeg)

### **Figure 4.15:**

**Background:** Another hereditary disease associated with anterior ST segment elevation is the Brugada Syndrome. **ECG:** The ECG in the Brugada Syndrome has a characteristic appearance with a late positive deflection in the right precordial leads V1 and V2. In addition to the late positive

deflection the ST segment will be elevated in these leads with a characteristic "sail" or "shark fin" pattern. **Clinical Issues:** Patients with Brugada Syndrome are at higher risk for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death.

![](_page_31_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_31_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 4.16:**

**Background:** Another hereditary disease associated with anterior ST segment elevation is the Brugada Syndrome. **ECG:** Another ECG pattern associated with the Brugada Syndrome has been described. The late terminal positive deflection (looks like right bundle branch block – Chapter 7, Figure 7.5) is present but the ST segment elevation has a sagging "saddleback" pattern.

**Clinical Issues:** Patients with Brugada Syndrome are at higher risk for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. Some studies suggest that the "saddleback" form has a better prognosis than the "shark fin" form.

# Precordial ST Segment Elevation

### Hyperkalemia

![](_page_33_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_33_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 4.17:**

**Background:** Any disease associated with renal failure can be associated with hyperkalemia. **ECG:** The classic finding with hyperkalemia is peaked T waves (Chapter 6, Figure 6.3). However, hyperkalemia can also be associated with ST elevation and the development of Q waves and can sometimes be indistinguishable from an acute coronary artery occlusion. The only clue that can sometimes alert the clinician to hyperkalemia as the cause of ST segment elevation is the presence of peaked T waves in addition to the ST segment elevation. In the example ST segment elevation (impossible to distinguish from an anteroseptal myocardial infarction) but narrow based peaked T waves are present in the other anterior leads, particularly lead V4. Importantly, hyperkalemia should not be

associated with chest pain or other symptoms of myocardial ischemia. In patients with severe hyperkalemia patients will develop QRS widening often without a specific left or right bundle branch block pattern. **Clinical Issues:** Hyperkalemia can be associated with life threatening arrhythmias and needs to be rapidly treated and the cause identified (usually renal failure). Hyperkalemia is treated with insulin and glucose (insulin 5–10 units and glucose 25 g (1 amp) intravenously), bicarbonate (44–88 mEq (1–2 amps) intravenously), and beta agonists (nebulized albuterol 10–20 mg) that quickly shift potassium to the intracellular space. In rare cases, intravenous calcium gloconate (10%, 5–30ml) or calcium chloride (5%, 5–30 ml) can be administered.

# Precordial ST Segment Elevation (Lateral)

### Lateral Myocardial Infarction

![](_page_35_Figure_4.jpeg)

### **Figure 4.18:**

**Background:** The distinction between an anterolateral myocardial infarction and true lateral wall myocardial infarction may vary from interpreter to interpreter. Generally a lateral wall myocardial infarction is due to the occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery or one of its branches but can also be due to occlusion of a *ramus intermedius* or a diagonal branch from the left anterior descending artery if these arteries supply the lateral wall in an individual.

major coronary arteries depending on the patient's individual

**ECG:** In a lateral myocardial wall myocardial infarction the ST segments will be elevated in leads I and aVL. Any accompanying ST segment elevation will depend on the vessel that is affected. In this example (compare to Figure 4.19), ST segment elevation is also observed in the precordial leads V3 to V6. Subtle reciprocal ST depression and T wave inversion is observed in the inferior leads (inverted T waves in leads III and aVF). **Clinical Issues:** Lateral myocardial infarctions can be associated with significant occlusions in any of the three

anatomy. The left anterior descending coronary artery has branches that plunge vertically into the interventricular septum (called septal perforators) and also course laterally toward the lateral apex (diagonal branches). Occlusion of a diagonal branch can cause a lateral myocardial infarction. The other main branch of the left main artery, the circumflex courses laterally between the left atrium and the left ventricle and occlusion of either the circumflex or its branches can cause a lateral myocardial infarction. As has been mentioned, some patients have a third branch, called a *ramus intermedius* that can be associated with a lateral wall myocardial infarction. Finally, in some patients the right coronary artery, after the posterior descending artery (which travels along the inferior portion of the interventricular septum toward the apex) branches off, will extend leftward and give rise to large posterolateral branches that supply blood to the lateral wall. Occlusion of one of these distal posterolateral branches can lead to a lateral myocardial infarction.

difficult.

### **Figure 4.19:**

**Background:** As described in Figure 4.18, lateral wall myocardial infarction can have many manifestations. **ECG:** Given the significant patient variability for causes of lateral wall myocardial infarctions it is not surprising that the ECG manifestations also vary significantly. In this example, in addition to ST segment elevation is only present in the lateral leads I and aVL. The other lateral leads V5 and V6 do not have ST segment elevation. True lateral wall myocardial infarctions without involvement of other walls (anterorlateral or inferolateral) are almost always due to an occlusion in the circumflex coronary artery system (the circumflex itself or

one of its branches, the obtuse marginals). The diagnosis of a ST elevation due to a true lateral myocardial infarction can sometimes be difficult to make, but the presence of reciprocal changes in the inferior leads is an important clue that significant myocardial injury is present. **Clinical Issues:** Again it is important to remember that the extent of ST segment elevation correlates roughly with the amount of myocardium that is at risk. However, since the lateral wall is "covered" by fewer leads than the anterior wall, estimating myocardium at risk can sometimes be

# Precordial and Lateral ST Segment Elevation

### Inferolateral Myocardial Infarction

![](_page_39_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_39_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 4.20:**

**Background:** As discussed for the previous two figures, lateral myocardial infarction can be causes by lesions in any of the three major vasculature systems. This example is a lateral MI due to a right coronary artery lesion. **ECG:** In this case ST segment elevation is prominent in the lateral leads with the addition of early repolarization (notice the "hooks" at the end of the QRS complex). In many myocardial infarctions that involve the lateral wall, the

inferior ST segment elevation is most prominent in Lead II and less prominent in aVF and III. The presence of reciprocal ST depression in leads V1 and V2 is an important clue that acute myocardial injury is the cause for the extensive inferolateral ST segment elevation. **Clinical Issues:** The same clinical problems as for the prior two figures.

# Precordial and Lateral ST Segment Elevation

![](_page_41_Figure_4.jpeg)

### **Figure 4.21:**

**Background:** Pericarditis is the inflammation of the pericardium. Pericarditis can be observed in a number of conditions, most commonly after cardiac surgery. Other causes of pericarditis include viral, bacterial, and immunologic disorders. Most frequently no specific cause can be identified and the pericarditis is termed "idiopathic."

**ECG:** Classically, there are four stages of pericarditis that can evolve over a period of time that can vary from weeks to months. There are specific ventricular repolarization changes that occur in each stage:

**Stage 1:** Concave ST segment elevation **Stage 2:** ST segment returns to baseline **Stage 3:** T wave inversion

**Stage 4:** Gradual resolution of T waves.

The ST segment elevation generally is observed in the precordial leads and the inferior leads. Importantly there are no leads with reciprocal ST segment depression except for aVR. Pericarditis can also affect atrial tissue, so there will be

PR segment depression best seen in the inferolateral leads and PR segment elevation in aVR. In comparison to the rest of the leads, lead aVR has as opposite response ST segment and PR response because it is the only ECG lead that "looks" at the heart from the right side and the inside surface of the heart. Since the pericardium overlies the heart, all of the leads except for aVR look "directly" at the injured pericardium resulting in widespread ST segment elevation. Lead aVR is probably the best lead for identifying pericarditis because of its characteristic presentation: PR segment elevation and the only lead with ST segment depression. The ST segment elevation has been described as "sagging" rather than the "domed" ST segment elevation observed in a STEMI. Importantly in pericarditis ventricular depolarization will not be affected so Q waves will not be seen unless the patient has Q waves for another reason. The important teaching point is that Q waves associated with ST segment elevation are an important clue that myocardial injury is present. The ECG differences between pericarditis and an

**Figure 4.21:** (*Cont'd*) inferolateral myocardial infarction are easily identified and are summarized in Table 4.2. Patients with pericarditis may develop significant atrial arrhythmias with atrial fibrillation as the most commonly observed abnormal rhythm. **Clinical Issues:** One of the most common problems encountered in clinical medicine is evaluating the patient with chest pain. This is covered in detail in Chapter 14 but for the sake of this short discussion it is important to remember that since coronary arterial occlusion is potentially life-threatening and often has more significant long-term consequences than pericarditis, in general, possible coronary artery occlusion should always be the "working diagnosis" for any patient with chest pain.

## Inferior ST Segment Elevation Normal variant

### **Figure 4.22:**

**Background:** "Normal" ST segment elevation is normally most prominent in leads V1 and V2 although minor ST segment elevation may be seen in any lead particularly in the presence of early repolarization.

**ECG:** ST segment elevation less than or equal to 1 mm may be normally observed in any lead. In leads V1 and V2 where "normal" ST segment elevation is most commonly observed, ST segment elevation up to 2 mm is still within normal limits. It is important to evaluate any ST segment changes relative to the T-P segment. In this example, ST segment "elevation"

is most prominent in the inferior leads with the largest apparent deflection in lead aVF. Notice that when a horizontal line is drawn, the ST segment is actually reasonably isoelectric when compared to the T-P segment and the apparent ST depression is actually due to PR segment depression. **Clinical Issues:** ECG findings must always be evaluated in the context of patient symptoms. However, evaluation of the ECG in a patient with early repolarization who is also complaining of chest pain, careful clinical evaluation is required.

### Inferior Wall Myocardial Infarction

### **Figure 4.23:**

**Background:** The posterior descending coronary artery travels along the interventricular groove parallel to the left anterior descending artery but on the most inferior portion of the heart and is most commonly a branch of the right coronary artery although in some cases it can arise from the circumflex coronary artery.

**ECG:** The hallmark of an inferior MI is inferior ST segment elevation. In this example the ST segment elevation is very subtle (compare it to Figure 4.19). Notice that the ST segment is elevated in relation to the T-P segment and that

reciprocal ST segment depression is observed in lead aVL and V1. In this example, Q waves in the inferior leads are not observed. **Clinical Issues:** Inferior wall myocardial infarction in most cases is due to occlusion/stenosis of the right coronary artery. Generally patients with an inferior wall myocardial infarction have a better prognosis than those patients with an anterior wall myocardial infarction but in either case, steps aimed at reestablishing blood flow to the injured area is indicated.

### **Figure 4.24:**

**Background:** In any myocardial infarction there is evolution of ECG findings. In addition inferior wall myocardial infarction may be associated with atrioventricular (AV) block at least in part because the AV node receives its blood supply from the AV nodal branch from the right coronary artery.

**ECG:** The ECG will display different characteristics as the myocardial infarction "evolves" (Chapter 14, Figure 14.7). In this case the ST segments are elevated in the inferior leads and a Q wave is observed in lead III. Although Q waves may be observed in lead III under normal conditions, the presence

of ST segment elevation with an accompanying Q wave should always arouse suspicion that the Q wave represents myocardial injury and abnormal ventricular depolarization. In the example the PR interval (the P wave is denoted by the \*) is prolonged. Varying degrees of AV block can be observed during inferior wall myocardial infarction. **Clinical Issues:** In general the AV conduction abnormalities associated with an inferior wall myocardial infarction resolve with time after the acute injury, but in some cases the recovery can be prolonged lasting weeks.

# Inferior Wall Myocardial Infarction (Evolving)

![](_page_51_Figure_4.jpeg)

### **Figure 4.25:**

**Background:** The evolution of ECG changes in an inferior wall myocardial infarction is fairly predictable but the timing of the progression of changes can be very variable. **ECG:** In this example of an inferior wall myocardial infarction, Q waves due to abnormal ventricular depolarization are present in all three of the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF). The ST segments remain elevated in the inferior leads but the T waves are now inverted. In the setting of myocardial infarction, ST segment elevation is initially associated with upright T waves but after a variable amount of time (usually

hours) the T waves become inverted while the ST segment remains elevated. In this example, abnormalities in V5 and V6 are also observed, probably due to large posterolateral branches that provide blood to the lower portion of the lateral wall of the left ventricle. **Clinical Issues:** Although the presence of T wave inversion and Q waves suggests that initial occlusion of the artery occurred several hours ago, the primary treatment remains reestablishing adequate blood flow to the injured area.

# Inferior Wall Myocardial Infarction ("Posterior" extension)

![](_page_53_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 4.26:**

**Background:** After the posterior descending artery branches off to provide blood to the more apical regions of the inferior wall the right coronary artery often continues toward the lateral wall of the heart and may give off large posterolateral branches. **ECG:** The larger posterolateral branches provide blood to the posterior wall. The posterior wall is commonly referred to in ECG texts although recent documents are trying to eliminate this word. Since there is no ECG lead that is directly over the "posterior" wall, injury and infarction in this area is usually assessed by evaluating lead V1 which is oriented 180° from

the posterior wall. Since it is opposite, Q waves are manifest as a large R wave, ST segment elevation appears as ST depression, and an inverted T wave appears as an upright T wave. For these reasons the diagnosis of a "posterior" wall myocardial infarction is suggested by the presence of an R wave, ST segment depression, and an upright T wave in lead V1. **Clinical Issues:** The changes described for identifying a posterior wall myocardial infarction are generally late in the course of the myocardial infarction/injury but again management focuses on reestablishing blood flow to the abnormal region.

# Inferior Wall Myocardial Infarction (With left bundle branch block)

![](_page_55_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_55_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 4.27:**

**Background:** Evaluation of the ECG can be very difficult in left bundle branch block since both depolarization and repolarization are abnormal in the setting of left bundle branch block.

**ECG:** In general, left bundle branch block is associated with ST abnormalities that are "opposite" the direction of depolarization: A lead with a negative QRS complex will have ST segment elevation and a lead with a positive QRS complex will have ST segment depression. The presence of an ST segment change that is "concordant" with the QRS complex would be unexpected and may represent abnormal

repolarization due to myocardial injury. In this example, abnormal ST segment elevation is observed in the inferior leads (since the QRS complexes are positive we would expect ST segment depression in these leads). In left bundle branch block, abnormal depolarization makes evaluation of depolarization abnormalities (Q waves) impossible. **Clinical Issues:** The presence of left bundle branch block makes evaluation of the ECG for myocardial injury very problematic. For this reason, the clinician must depend almost exclusively on symptoms and physical examination findings.

### **Figure 4.28:**

**Background:** In addition to atherosclerosis and thrombus, another cause of myocardial injury/infarction is spasm of the coronary artery. The ECG changes are almost indistinguishable but often the ECG changes associated with spasm are more transient.

**ECG:** The ECG changes associated with coronary artery spasm are the same as for an acute myocardial infarction (not surprising since both lead to cessation of blood flow to an area of myocardium). In this case of spasm of the right

coronary artery, profound ST segment elevation is observed in the inferior leads with reciprocal ST segment depression in the anterior and lateral leads. **Clinical Issues:** Generally coronary artery spasm resolves after several minutes and the ECG changes resolve as blood flow is reestablished. The treatment for spasm is generally medical therapy such as calcium channel blockers that promote vasodilation.

## ST Segment Elevation in aVR

### Critical Left Main

![](_page_59_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_59_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 4.29:** Left Main

**Background:** Although there are many anatomic variations, the left main coronary artery begins at the aorta and is usually about 1 to 2 cm long before it divides into the left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries. Occlusion of the left main coronary artery leads to large areas of myocardial injury and ischemia. **ECG:** A critical left main coronary artery lesion often results in prominent ST segment depression in multiple leads. In the example, ST depression is observed in multiple leads: III, aVL and V2 through V6. ST segment elevation is observed in the leads that are oriented on the right of the heart: V1, III, and aVR. In particular ST segment elevation is very prominent in aVR. In any patient with ST segment elevation in aVR, stenosis or a critical lesion in the left main coronary artery should be suspected. Lead aVR is the only lead that "looks"

directly at the endocardial surface ("inside") of the left ventricle. Since the endocardial surface is the most downstream area in the coronary artery circulation, limiting blood flow at the left main coronary artery leads to global ischemia that is most prominent on the endocardium. **Clinical Issues:** Patients with a suspected lesion of the left main coronary artery require rapid and aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic management. In most cases an emergent cardiac catheterization to confirm the presence of a left main coronary artery lesion and to define the anatomy of the coronary arteries is performed. Although a percutaneous coronary artery angioplasty may be useful for managing the patient in the acute setting, ultimately coronary artery bypass grafting is often required.
