### **CHAPTER 1**

# **Technical Issues**

It is always a bit worrisome when the first chapter has such a dry and uninspiring title, but it is extremely important to understand the fundamentals of the electrocardiogram (ECG) before using the ECG as a clinical tool. The ECG was originally developed over a century ago by Willem Einthoven and has become one of the most important diagnostic tools used for evaluating the heart. Very simply, the heart can be compared to a pump with a primary function of transporting blood to different parts of the body. "Control" of the pump requires an electrical system and, in the heart, contraction of the chambers begins and is controlled by electrical currents generated by cells with spontaneous electrical activity (also called pacemaker activity). The electrical activity produced by the heart causes small electrical changes on the skin that can be measured using skin electrodes. Don't worry; with an average voltage of 1 mV or less, your body won't power a flashlight. The electrodes are connected to a recording machine with special electronics that amplify and enhance the signal. In one subspecialty field of cardiology called electrophysiology, instead of measuring electrical activity from the body surface, electrical activity is measured directly from the inside of the heart chambers using specialized catheters, that are essentially wires coated with insulation and a metal electrode at the tip, inserted into one of the vessels of the body and threaded to the heart itself.

Before we can talk about the ECG and the heart, we have to discuss some extremely dry concepts that describe some of the technical issues on how the ECG is obtained. Although this portion of the book can be extremely mundane, details about electrodes, leads, and the ECG display are important and form the basis for understanding the ECG. Perhaps suffer through this first chapter with only a cursory read and come back to this chapter after you have read some of the other portions of the book.

## **Electrode placement**

The ECG uses electrodes placed on the skin to measure the cardiac electrical activity. Obtaining good quality images is essential for proper interpretation and requires good and stable contact between the electrode and the skin. As an interesting aside, one of the seminal figures of cardiology, Augustus Waller (who provided the first comprehensive discussion of electrical activity of the heart), used a mouth electrode as a standard position, probably because this surface allowed better conductivity of electrical signals. In the past, to improve electrical conductivity, specialized gel was used between the skin and the metal electrodes. Now almost universally in industrialized nations, the electrodes are small specially designed disposable patches that have a light adhesive that also acts as a conductor to optimize transmission of the electrical signal from the skin to the ECG machine. Generally, the ECG is recorded while the patient is lying on his or her back (supine position) to avoid artifact introduced from body movement. Sometimes patient conditions such as tremors (Parkinson's disease) or interference from other electrical equipment may make recording an ECG difficult. Within the ECG machine itself are special electronics that amplify the electrical signal and filter the electrical signal to "clean-up" the recording. As will be described later, sometimes the ECG is recorded while the patient is exercising on a treadmill. In order to reduce the artifact, these specialized machines use additional electronic circuitry to remove the excess noise introduced by body motion.

To obtain a 12 lead ECG, 10 electrodes are placed on the extremities and the chest (Figure 1.1). One electrode is placed on each of the four extremities: left and right arms and left and right legs. The extremities can be compared to "extension cords" and the ECG signal will not be affected by the exact position of the electrode on the extremity. In contrast, placing a limb electrode on the trunk will lead to some changes in the signals recorded by the ECG. The remaining six electrodes are placed on the anterior chest in specific positions. Collectively the chest electrodes are often called the precordial (the word comes from Latin – *prae*, "front of," and *cor*, "heart") leads and usually referred to as V1 through V6 moving from right to left on the chest. The V1 electrode is placed in the fourth intercostal space just to the right of the sternum and the V2 electrode is placed in the fourth intercostal space just to the left of the sternum. The V4 electrode is placed in the fifth intercostal space in

line with the middle of the clavicle (collar bone). The V3 electrode is placed half way between V2 and V4 . The V5 electrode is also placed in the fifth intercostal space at the same level as the V4 electrode but is located on the left anterior axillary line. The left anterior axillary line is an imaginary vertical line that extends from the front crease of the armpit (*axilla* is the Latin word for "armpit" or "side"). The V6 electrode is placed at the same level as the V4 and V5 electrodes, but in the mid axillary line which is an imaginary vertical line drawn from the middle of the armpit. Electrodes should be placed in regions with no or minimal hair as hair might prevent good contact between the skin and the electrode. Electrodes are not placed on bones because bony tissue does not conduct electrical activity as well as muscular issue. In women, the electrodes should generally be placed below the breast (closer to the heart) but if necessary can be placed on top of the breast if this position is closest to the standard electrode position. Misplacement of the chest electrodes will lead to significant changes in the ECG recordings.

Some experts have advocated additional chest leads that extend around the back of the torso (V7 –V9 ) or to the right chest (V4 R, V5 R, and V6 R) to provide a more complete measurement of cardiac electrical activity. Although these additional lead positions may be extremely useful in certain specific situations, for the purposes of this discussion the reader should simply be aware that these additional electrode positions have been described and might be encountered in the hospital.

Often continuous ECG recordings are obtained while the patient is in the hospital to allow for rapid identification of cardiac problems. In this case, the 10 electrodes required for the standard ECG (4 on the limbs and 6 on the anterior chest) can be cumbersome for a patient to have on at all times so that depending on the system, 3 to 6 electrodes are placed on the torso. Specialized algorithms are then used to "derive" a full 12 lead ECG in some systems. Although these recording systems are useful for rapid evaluation of abnormal rhythms or marked changes on the ECG, the full 12 lead ECG using 10 separate electrodes is generally required for final interpretation of many abnormalities. For example, if a person in the hospital develops chest pain or a sustained abnormal heart rhythm, if possible, a standard 12 lead ECG should be obtained even if their cardiac rhythm is being monitored.

# **Electrodes and leads**

In order to measure any kind of electrical activity, two electrodes are required so that the measuring device can measure the voltage difference between the two locations. The ECG has traditionally used 12 electrode pairs or leads to measure the cardiac activity of the heart.

The ECG leads are generally divided into the frontal leads that use the extremity electrodes and measure electrical activity in a vertical plane, and the precordial leads that use the six chest electrodes and measure electrical activity in a roughly horizontal plane. Historically, the first leads that were used are referred to by Roman numerals I, II, and III (Figure 1.2): Lead I measures the voltage difference between the left arm and the right arm electrodes (with the right arm the "negative" electrode), lead II measures the difference between the right arm and the left leg electrodes (with the right arm as the "negative" electrode), and lead III measures the difference between the left leg and the left arm (with the left arm as the "negative" electrode). The right leg electrode is used as a ground. The ground is important for defining the zero voltage since ECG leads measure voltage differences rather than absolute values. From a practical

The electrodes used for obtaining the frontal leads of the ECG: I, II, III, aVR, aVL, and aVF. Leads aVR, aVL, and aVF are often called the unipolar limb leads because they record the voltage change in one of the extremities relative to an averaged value of the other electrodes.

standpoint, the ECG machine uses the signal from the ground to help filter extraneous electrical noise. The other three frontal leads are referred to by the shorthand aVR, aVL, and aVF and one electrode (the positive electrode) at the right arm, left arm, and left leg respectively compared to a composite electrode that is the averaged voltage from the remaining two electrodes. The small letter "a" is for "augmented" since the signal obtained is augmented or larger because the second electrode used is an averaged voltage from the other two limb leads.

Since leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, and aVF measure activity in the same plane they are always considered together and traditionally represented by a large circle with the negative electrodes for each of the leads aligned in the middle of the chest (Figure 1.3). The positive electrodes extend outward in

a circle in a single plane called the frontal plane. Specific orientations in the frontal plane are defined by the degrees of a circle with the horizontal axis toward the left is defined as 0° with positive values in the clockwise direction and negative values in the counter clockwise direction. In this way each of the extremity leads can be defined by a specific orientation: I, II, and III are 0°, 60°, and 120° respectively and aVR, aVL, and aVF are −150°, −30°, and 90° respectively. One way that can help you visualize this is a compass with North, East, South, and West equal to −90°, 0°, 90°, and 180°.

For the precordial leads electrical activity is measured between one of the six chest electrodes and the sum of the left arm, right arm, and left leg signals which is generally close to zero since the signals tend to cancel out (Figure 1.2). The composite electrode is considered the negative electrode and the electrode on the anterior chest as the positive electrode. With the negative electrode placed in the middle of the torso, the positive electrodes of the precordial leads fan out in a horizontal plane that is roughly perpendicular to the frontal plane (Figure 1.3).

Although truthfully voltage differences are measured between two electrodes, by convention the positive electrode of any electrode pair is used to indicate the general orientation of a specific lead. Don't get too wrapped up into positive and negative electrodes (as it does not help the clinician very much), it is easier to think of the positive electrode as the location of the "sensor" for a particular lead receiving input from the heart. Thinking in this fashion the 12 leads of the ECG in the frontal and horizontal planes provide a relatively comprehensive 3 dimensional "sensor net" for evaluating the electrical activity of the heart. One useful analogy is to compare the positive electrodes of an ECG to windows located on different walls of a building. By looking through all of the windows at the same time, the viewer ("peeping Tom?!") can get a fairly good idea of what is going on inside.

Clinically, the 12 leads can be grouped or divided based on the general orientation of the positive electrode relative to the heart (Figure 1.4). Leads II, III, and aVF are collectively called the "inferior leads" since they are oriented with the positive electrode "pointing upwards" and are in the best position measure electrical changes occurring on the bottom of the heart. Leads I, aVL, V5 , and V6 are called the "lateral leads" since they best measure electrical activity on the left side of the heart, and leads V1 , V2 , V3 , and V4 are called the "anterior leads." Sometimes leads V1 and V2 are further subclassified as "anteroseptal." Lead aVR is the only lead that is oriented on the right and best measures activity from the right side

(perhaps with a little contribution from leads III and V1 ). Grouping the leads in this way is very helpful for identifying myocardial (heart muscle) injury and localizing the region of damage.

Since the positive electrodes of the leads are oriented in different positions around the heart, the shape of the deflections recorded on a lead will give the clinician some clue of the direction of depolarization. The electrical activity of cardiac cells is generally divided into two periods. When the cell is excited it is depolarized and this leads to contraction in heart cells. After a short period of time (about 0.4 seconds) the cell repolarizes and the heart cell relaxes. The terms depolarization and repolarization can sometimes be confusing but they come from the fact that at rest cells have a negative charge and when the cell is excited the charge is approximately zero (the cell has lost charge or has been *de*polarized).

# **Figure 1.5:**

ECG paper is divided into 1 mm × 1 mm "small" boxes that are grouped together in 5 × 5 mm "large" boxes. At standard settings, in the horizontal direction, 5 large boxes (25 mm) is equal to one second and, in the vertical direction 2 large boxes (10 mm) is equal to 1 mV.

Progressive activation of the heart cells leads to a wave of depolarization that is measured by the ECG. By convention, when depolarization travels toward the positive electrode a positive deflection is recorded and if the wave of depolarization is travelling away from the positive electrode a negative deflection will be recorded. Conversely if the direction of repolarization is oriented toward the positive electrode of an ECG lead a negative deflection will be recorded. To continue our earlier "window and building" analogy, we can think of the electrical activity of the heart as a person walking inside the building. As the person walks toward a window in the front of the building, he appears larger (and the electrical signal is positive), but from a window in the back, he is walking away so he looks smaller (and the electrical signal is negative). In the next chapter we will discuss the specific shapes of waves due to atrial and ventricular depolarization and ventricular repolarization (we will also explain why we cannot evaluate atrial repolarization).

# **Displaying the ECG**

ECG recording paper is divided into "small boxes" that are I mm by 1 mm and "large boxes" that are 5 mm by 5 mm (Figure 1.5). Usually the ECG machine is set so that a 1 mV signal will lead to a 10 mm deflection in the

![](_page_9_Figure_1.jpeg)

**Figure 1.6:**

**Top:** The most common standard display of the ECG shows the 12 leads as four columns and three rows. The first column displays leads I, II, and III. The second column displays aVR, aVL, and aVF. The third column displays V1 , V2 , and V3 . The fourth column displays V4 , V5 , and V6 . In this way the frontal leads are grouped as the first two columns and the pre cordial leads are grouped as the second two columns. A standar dization mark (\*) is always shown on the far left.

**Bottom:** A second standard display shows all of the leads one on top of another usually in the following order: I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1 , V2 , V3 , V4 , V5 , and V6 . Both the top and the bottom ECGs are from the same person. Notice that the bottom ECG has smaller signals because it was recorded at "half standard." (Look at the standardization mark (\*), a 1 mV signal made only a 5 mm signal.)

ECG in the vertical direction. In the horizontal direction, the usual paper speed is 25 mm per second so that each large box (5 mm) represents 0.20 seconds and each little box (1 mm) represents 0.04 seconds. The settings of an ECG machine can generally be determined by looking for a standard mark usually at the far left of an ECG, where a 1 mV signal for 0.2 seconds is delivered. If the ECG machine is set to its usual settings this leads to a standardization mark signal that is 10 mm tall and 5 mm wide (Figure 1.6). If the paper speed is decreased to 12.5 mm per second, the signals become more compressed on the horizontal axis because each large box represents 0.40 seconds and if the paper speed is increased to 50 mm per second (10 large boxes equals one second), each large box is 0.10 seconds. In the same way if the voltage standard is halved then a 1 mV deflection leads to a 0.5 mm deflection and the size of the signal will be "squished" (Figure 1.6). In general these other settings are not used for the 12 lead ECG.

Although monitors still use specially designed paper that produces long "strips" of signals, for the sake of convenience and easier evaluation of all 12 leads, 12 lead ECGs are generally printed on standard letter size paper. Most commonly, the 12 lead ECG is displayed in four columns and three rows (Figure 1.6). The first column shows I, II, and III, the second column shows aVR, aVL, and aVF, the third column shows V1 , V2 , and V3 , and the fourth column shows V4 , V5 , and V6 . Just remember that the first two columns are frontal leads and the second two columns show the precordial leads. If the ECG is set at the standard paper speed, on standard letter paper, the full ECG records 10 seconds of electrical activity and each lead has 2.5 seconds of recording. A standard piece of paper is 279 mm long or about 55 "large" boxes. Another format usually called a rhythm strip shows a single lead for 10 seconds. Three to twelve leads are shown one on top of another (Figure 1.6).

Using the standard format, the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF) take up the "bottom left corner" of the ECG, the anterior leads (V1–V4) are in the "upper right corner", and the lateral leads (V5,V6, I, and aVL) are scattered all over (Figure 1.7).
