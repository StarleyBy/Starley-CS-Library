#### **Abnormal Depolarization: A Prominent R Wave in V1**

So if you have gotten to this point you have finished evaluating the ST segment and the T wave. Remember that these two portions of the ECG represent ventricular repolarization. Since evaluation of patients with chest pain is one of the principal emergent clinical uses for the ECG, we have focused our initial discussion on ventricular repolarization. However, evaluation of ventricular depolarization is the other important component for evaluating ECG morphology (all the stuff other than rhythm), it is just that it can often be done at a more leisurely pace once active myocardial injury has been ruled out.

The easiest way to quickly assess ventricular depolarization is to examine lead V1 . The normal QRS is "narrow" (QRS < 0.12 s), and in lead V1 the complex is usually characterized by an rS complex (Figure 7.1). With this in mind the two initial questions are: Is the QRS < 0.12 seconds? And is the QRS predominantly negative? If the answer to both of these questions is yes, the "general sequence and direction" of ventricular depolarization is probably normal. Once this has been established the ECG can be evaluated for frontal axis, Q waves, and other more subtle abnormalities of ventricular depolarization.

A narrow QRS is evidence that the ventricles are being activated simultaneously. However, if a wide QRS complex is present the ventricles are taking longer to depolarize because of relative delays in depolarization of some portions of the ventricles. The most common cause of a wide QRS complex is conduction block or delay in the left or right bundle (Figure 7.2). Block or delay in left bundle leads to depolarization of the right ventricle followed by depolarization in the left ventricle. Conversely, block or delay in the right bundle leads to initial left ventricular depolarization

**Figure 7.1:** Initial evaluation of ventricular depolarization is best done in lead V1. The normal depolarization is "narrow and negative." With this in mind, abnormal depolarization can be "wide and negative," "narrow and positive," or "wide and positive."

followed by right ventricular depolarization. Usually, because of its smaller mass, depolarization of the right ventricle is not observed on the ECG due to "canceling out" from depolarization of the larger left ventricle in the opposite direction. However, in right bundle branch block, depolarization of the right ventricle is late so it is "unopposed" (left ventricular depolarization has already occurred) and a late positive deflection (an R wave) is seen in V, and a corresponding late negative deflection (S wave) in  $V_{\epsilon}$  (Figure 7.3). A much rarer cause of a wide QRS complex is early depolarization of a portion of the ventricles. Usually the AV node and His bundle form the only way for atrioventricular conduction because the valvular annulus (the fibrous rings that provide the structure for the valves) is electrically inert. In some patients the valvular annulus does not form completely and there is a residual thread of tissue called an accessory pathway that provides an additional electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles. In this case early depolarization of ventricular tissue near the insertion point leads to a wide QRS.

A predominantly negative QRS complex in lead V, means that ventricular depolarization is directed away from the right anterior chest (the location of V<sub>1</sub>). This is the normally observed direction of depolarization because anatomically the left ventricle is located behind the right ventricle (Chapter 2, Figure 2.7). If the QRS is positive (a prominent R wave) in lead V<sub>1</sub>, it means that a large portion of the ventricles is being depolarized from "back to front" (Figure 7.3). A "prominent R wave in V,"

This schematic shows ventricular depolarization (dotted arrows) and the resultant ECG forces (solid arrows) with normal ventricular depolarization. riaht branch block, and left bundle branch block. During normal ventricular depolarization, after AV node and His bundle depolarization the septum is depolarized from left to right due to depolarization from the left bundle (shorter solid arrow). Near simultaneous

depolarization of the left and right ventricles leads to a net leftward depolarization due to the larger left ventricular mass (longer solid arrow). In right bundle branch block, septal and left ventricular depolarization is unchanged but late depolarization of the right ventricle leads to a late rightward force. In left bundle branch block both the septal regions and the rest of the left ventricle are depolarized from right to left.

#### **Figure 7.3:**

The direction and timing of ventricular depolarization will change the QRS morphologies in V1 and V6 . The easiest way to evaluate ventricular depolarization is to examine the QRS morphology in lead V1 because this will give the clinician a sense for whether depolarization is directed toward the front of the chest or to the back. The most common cause of a wide negative QRS complex is left bundle branch block where there is sequential activation of the right ventricle followed by the left ventricle. The most common cause of a wide positive QRS complex is right bundle branch block where late depolarization of the right ventricles leads to a late positive wave (R') in lead V1

is most commonly due to right bundle branch block but is also observed in conditions that are associated with an increase in right ventricular size. However, right bundle branch block will always be characterized by a wide QRS. The common possible causes of a prominent R wave in V, are summarized in Figures 7.4 to 7.18.

**Figure 7.4:** 

There are several ECG clues that can help identify some of the common causes of a prominent R wave in V1.

## Prominent R Wave (Wide)

### Right Bundle Branch Block

![](_page_8_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_8_Figure_5.jpeg)

#### **Figure 7.5:**

**Background:** The most common cause of a prominent R wave in V1 is the presence of right bundle branch block. Right bundle branch block may be observed in 1% of healthy populations and generally has no clinical consequence.

**ECG:** The ECG in right bundle branch block is characteristic. Late activation of the right ventricle leads to a late force

directed anteriorly and toward the right chest (since this is where the right ventricle is located). This leads to a late positive R wave in lead V1 and a late negative S wave in V6 and an overall QRS width that is ≥ 0.12 s. **Clinical Issues:** In general there are no additional clinical issues with right bundle branch block and no additional evaluation is required.

Right Bundle Branch Block (with Q waves)

![](_page_10_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_10_Figure_5.jpeg)

#### **Figure 7.6:**

**Background:** As shown in Figure 7.2, initial septal activation is normal in right bundle branch block. As discussed in Chapter 8, one of the ECG signs of a myocardial infarction in the past is a Q wave or initial negative deflection in the QRS complex.

**ECG:** Since initial left ventricular activation is via the left bundle, in isolated right bundle branch block abnormal depolarization from a prior myocardial infarction may be observed. In the example, Q waves are present in leads V1 and V2. Remember that Q waves are simply an initial negative deflection in the QRS complex. Although initial negative deflections are expected in some leads such as aVR, in some cases they

are abnormal. In this case the Q waves represent a prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Remember that in these leads a small septal r wave would be normally observed. The loss of the septal r waves and the presence of the abnormal Q waves is due to a scar from the myocardial infarction that leads to a relative absence of electrical activity in these leads. **Clinical Issues:** The presence of new abnormal Q waves should always arouse suspicion of a prior myocardial infarction. Many myocardial infarctions are "silent" either because of true absence of symptoms or, more likely, the patient thought chest pain was not due to a cardiac cause and did not seek medical attention.

## Prominent R Wave (Wide)

Right Bundle Branch Block (with left anterior fascicular block)

![](_page_12_Figure_4.jpeg)

#### **Figure 7.7:**

**Background:** The left bundle divides into two major divisions: a left anterior fascicle and a left posterior fascicle. The right bundle is located adjacent to the left anterior fascicle and as a disease or degenerative process progresses right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block may occur together. Obviously if block occurs in the right bundle, and both divisions of the left bundle no atrioventricular conduction occurs (and a very slow heart rate – see Chapter 10).

**ECG:** In the setting of combined right bundle branch block and left anterior fasicular block, the left posterior bundle is providing initial ventricular activation. For this reason the

right ventricle and the superior portion of the left ventricle are activated late. This leads not only to the characteristic findings of right bundle branch block but the ventricular axis in the frontal plane is directed upward. **Clinical Issues:** When right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block are both present, the patient is dependent on the left posterior fascicle for ventricular activation. Fortunately the left posterior fascicular block is "short, fat, and stubby," so that it is generally fairly reliable and patients can do very well over extended periods of time with both right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block.

prolongation of the PR interval, or QRS widening, the more

likely that problems will arise in the future.

#### **Figure 7.8:**

**Background:** Evidence for extensive delays/block in the AV conduction system has often been called " trifascicular" block. Although this term has been used for many years, recent guidelines have discouraged its use since this term is often not accurate and has many ECG manifestations.

**ECG:** Trifascicular block is right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block combined with a prolonged PR interval. In the example a bizarre RBBB pattern is present in lead V1, with an almost completely positive QRS complex and left anterior fascicular block (left axis deviation with the largest frontal plane R wave in aVL and aVL with a qR morphology). In addition, the PR interval is prolonged. Compare this ECG to the ECG in Figure 7.7.

Notice that the QRS is significantly wider (0.21 s) compared to Figure 7.7 (0.16 s). **Clinical Issues:** As a general rule the wider the QRS complex the more severe the His Purkinje disease and myocardial disease. In fact several studies have shown a rough correlation between QRS width and left ventricular function: wider QRS complexes are associated with worse ejection fractions. Instead of using the term trifascicular block, it is better to simply understand that with more evidence for conduction tissue (AV node, His Bundle, and the bundle branches) disease such as accompanying fascicular block,

## Prominent R Wave (Wide)

Accessory Pathway (WPW) (left lateral accessory pathway)

![](_page_16_Figure_4.jpeg)

#### **Figure 7.9:**

**Background:** Normally the AV node and His bundle form the only electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles because the annulus that forms the support for the mitral and tricuspid valves is electrically inert. In approximately 1/1,000 people there is another muscular connection (an accessory pathway) between the atria and ventricles because of incomplete formation of the valvular annulus. This condition is usually called the Wolff Parkinson White Syndrome to honor the three physicians that provided the most complete ECG description of this collection of findings in the 1920s.

**ECG:** Normally the AV node and His bundle are the sole source for ventricular depolarization but in the presence of an accessory pathway the ventricle can be depolarized from two sites so the QRS complex represents a "fusion" of activation between these two sources. Since most accessory pathways conduct rapidly relative to the AV node and His bundle, the PR interval is short and there is an initial "delta" wave due to activation via the accessory pathway. Remember that although AV node conduction is slow, depolarization is extremely rapid via the His Purkinje system so that in general

the accessory pathway still activates a relatively small part of the ventricles even though it got a "head start." In patients with a left sided accessory pathway, since the left ventricle is located behind the right ventricle, this initial ventricular activation from the accessory pathway leads to a prominent R wave in V1. The best way to identify the presence of an accessory pathway is a short PR interval and an abnormal QRS complex due to the presence of the delta wave. In this example, the patient's accessory pathway is located in the lateral wall so the delta wave is negative (a q wave) in lead aVL. **Clinical Issues:** Patients with accessory pathways are at higher risk for the development of abnormal fast heart rhythms (tachycardias or tachyarrhythmias). Normally since the AV node and His bundle form the only connection between the atria and ventricles, ventricular depolarization cannot affect subsequent atrial contraction (feedback). However with two connections between the atria and ventricles, it is possible that ventricular depolarization from the AV node could "echo" back to the atrium by depolarization of the accessory pathway.

Prominent R Wave (Wide)

Accessory Pathway (WPW) (left inferior accessory pathway)

![](_page_18_Figure_4.jpeg)

### **Figure 7.10:**

**Background:** An accessory pathway can be located in any spot between the atria and ventricles. The most common location for an accessory pathway is the left ventricle with the lateral wall a more common location than the inferior wall.

**ECG:** Regardless of the location of the accessory pathway the PR interval is generally short but the morphology of the QRS complex will depend on the location of the accessory pathways. Left sided accessory pathways cause positive R waves in V1 and the specific location of the accessory pathway can be determined by the morphology of the delta wave. In general the delta wave will be negative in the leads that are located near the site of the accessory pathway

because initial ventricular depolarization radiates away from the accessory pathway. In this example, an accessory pathway in the inferior wall of the left ventricle will be associated with a negative delta wave in the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF). **Clinical Issues:** The important findings on the ECG that are suggestive of an accessory pathway are a short PR interval and an abnormal QRS due to the presence of a delta wave. Accessory pathways located at the inferior wall of the heart (nearest to the diaphragm) have often been called posterior accessory pathways because they are located farthest away from the anterior chest using a cardiac surgeon's

perspective.

# "Prominent" R Wave (Narrow)

### Normal septal R wave

![](_page_20_Figure_4.jpeg)

### **Figure 7.11:**

**Background:** A "septal" R wave up to 6 mm may be seen under normal conditions in V1. The R wave is more prominent in children. In fact, in newborns the R wave is often quite large because the right ventricle and left ventricle are pumping against similar "loads" (remember *in utero*, the lungs are not expanded and have a relatively high resistance). With aging, the R wave gradually decreases so that by the time someone is over 40 years old the R wave will be 1–2 mm with an upper range of 4–5 mm. Men have larger septal R waves than women.

**ECG:** As above an R wave < 6 mm is normal in lead V1, although an R wave > 3–4 mm should be evaluated closely. In general a normal R wave can be identified by the " company it keeps" so it should not be associated with

abnormal depolarization such as abnormal Q waves or axis deviation nor should there be associated repolarization changes such as ST segment deviation or abnormal T waves. As a corollary to the normal prominent R wave in V1, while most individuals have a precordial transition zone where the R wave and S wave are equal at V3 or V4, about 2–6% of people will have a transition zone at V1 and 12% of women and up to 25% of men will have a transition zone at V2. In this example, the R wave is about 4 mm with a transition zone at V1. The small inferolateral Q waves are from septal activation and are normal. **Clinical Uses:** Obviously it is important to know the upper limits of normal for an R wave in V1 and the normal precordial transition zone.

# "Prominent" R Wave (Narrow)

Right intaventricular conduction delay (rSr' complex)

![](_page_22_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_22_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 7.12:**

**Background:** In some cases a small late r' will be observed in lead V1 but the QRS will be < 0.12 s. In many cases this represents slightly delayed activation of the right ventricle (or relatively early normal activation of the left ventricle). This is generally a normal finding and is present in about 2–3% of healthy individuals.

**ECG:** Although not technically a "prominent R wave," it is convenient to talk about this ECG finding here because it has a similar mechanism as right bundle branch block. The ECG will have a rSr' signal with a normal QRS width with the r' < 5 mm and the r' wave will always be smaller than the S wave. Generally the accompanying frontal axis is normal. If there is accompanying frontal axis deviation (either left or

right) the possibility of an atrial septal defect (a congenital "hole" between the left and right atria) should be considered. In the example, a late forward depolarization of the right ventricle leads to a small r' signal in lead V1 and a corresponding small s wave in V6. The patient has a slightly leftward but still normal frontal axis about 0° with the largest R wave recorded in lead I. **Clinical Issues:** Generally there are no clinical consequences from a right intraventricular conduction delay. However, the clinician should carefully exclude the presence of an atrial septal defect if significant left or right axis deviation is present (usually by physical examination and in some cases by echocardiography).

# Prominent R Wave (Narrow)

### Right ventricular hypertrophy

![](_page_24_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_24_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 7.13:**

**Background:** There are several conditions that are associated with right ventricular hypertrophy including lung diseases and congenital heart disease. Generally right ventricular hypertrophy develops in any condition in which the right ventricle must contract against higher pressures. **ECG:** When significant right ventricular hypertrophy is present, if severe enough, the forces produced by right ventricular depolarization will be more prominent than the forces produced by left ventricular depolarization. This situation leads to a marked change in the direction of ventricular depolarization to left to right in the precordial plane and a rightward shift of the cardiac axis in the frontal plane. For this reason the hallmark of right ventricular hypertrophy is a prominent narrow R wave in lead V1 and right axis deviation. In this example, right axis deviation is present with the largest R wave in the frontal leads recorded in lead III. The other important finding associated with right ventricular hypertrophy is also shown in this example: the prominent R wave with a normal QRS duration in lead V1. Often in severe right ventricular hypertrophy the T wave will be inverted in lead V1; in older textbooks this will often be called right

ventricular "strain." The rightward direction of precordial depolarization also leads to a deep S wave in lead V6 as in this example where the S wave is larger than the R wave. Finally right ventricular hypertrophy will often lead to right atrial enlargement and the P wave will become more prominent. In this example notice how deeply negative the P wave is in aVR and very tall and "peaked" in lead V1. **Clinical Issues:** The presence of right ventricular hypertrophy by ECG is associated with significant disease. In fact, even though the left ventricle is responsible for pumping blood to the body and the right ventricle responsible for transporting blood to the lung, the presence of right ventricular hypertrophy has a far worse prognosis than left ventricular hypertrophy. In part this is because under normal conditions the pulmonary circulation offers very little resistance to flow. A useful analogy is to think of the pulmonary circulation as a large river delta, when flooding occurs upstream the delta easily accommodates the excess water. The development of right ventricular hypertrophy is a late event in most diseases and often heralds a very difficult future clinical course.

# Prominent R Wave (Narrow)

## Posterior wall myocardial infarction

![](_page_26_Figure_4.jpeg)

### **Figure 7.14:**

**Background:** The use of the term "posterior" myocardial infarction is no longer encouraged although it will still be frequently encountered in clinical medicine. The posterior wall was named because it was the wall farthest way from a surgeon looking at the heart from the front of the chest. In reference to the heart, this region is between/part of the inferior and lateral walls near the mitral annulus. Posterior infarction is usually due to occlusion of the right coronary artery or more rarely occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery.

**ECG:** Acute posterior wall myocardial infarction is discussed in Chapter 4 Figure 26 as there are usually associated ST changes. A posterior wall myocardial infarction that occurred in the past often does not have associated ST segment changes, rather the main finding is a prominent R wave in V1 associated with an upright T wave. Remember that lead V1 is directly opposite the posterior wall and the R wave and upright T wave actually represent an abnormal Q wave and T wave inversion if an electrode was placed directly over the injured area. Generally occlusion of the right coronary artery

causes an accompanying inferior wall myocardial infarction so Q waves in the inferior leads support the diagnosis of an old posterior wall myocardial infarction. In this example, the patient has both a posterior and an inferior wall myocardial infarction (inferior Qs in II, III, and aVF). The inferior wall myocardial infarction leads to left axis deviation with the largest R wave observed in aVL. Both a posterior accessory pathway and a posterior wall myocardial infarction will have a prominent R wave in V1 associated with inferior Q waves. However, a posterior wall myocardial infarction can be differentiated from a left posterior accessory pathway because the PR interval will be normal and delta waves will not be seen. Since hypertension is a risk factor for coronary artery disease, in many cases, as in this example, an inverted or biphasic P wave will be observed in lead V1 **Clinical Issues:** The presence of an old posterior wall myocardial infarction requires the clinician to make sure that he or she is aggressively treating risk factors for coronary artery disease such as hypertension or high cholesterol.

# Prominent R Wave (Narrow)

### Dextrocardia

![](_page_28_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_28_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 7.15:**

**Background:** Normally in the developing embryo, the heart forms on the left because of looping of the vascular tube. In some cases, the heart loops in the opposite direction leading to the heart located in the right chest or dextrocardia. Dextrocardia is rare and is present in less than 0.01% of the population.

**ECG:** In some cases of dextrocardia the heart is morphologically normal and the left ventricle is simply oriented to the right (this condition is usually associated with situs inversus where all of the organs are on the opposite side they are normally located). Dextrocardia leads to right axis deviation in the frontal leads, a prominent R wave in lead V1, and S waves in the lateral leads (since ventricular activation is travelling away from the left side). When dextrocardia is associated with situs inversus, the sinus node is located to the

left and the atria are activated from left to right. In this case the P wave is negative in aVL (rather than in aVR) although since the sinus node is still in the upper part of the right atrium the P waves are still upright in the inferior leads. In this example of dextrocardia the frontal axis is about −150° since the largest R wave is observed in aVR. The negative P wave and QS complex in aVL are the findings that with usual anatomy are found in aVR. Since the R wave is larger in V1 compared to V2, the precordial transition is in the right chest. **Clinical Issues:** Generally there are no specific clinic issues associated with dextrocardia unless other cardiac abnormalities are present. When obtaining the ECG some recommend reversing the limb leads and placing the precordial leads in their usual position but in the right chest; if this is done the ECG will look relatively normal.

### Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

![](_page_30_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_30_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 7.16:**

**Background:** Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a hereditary disease that is due to a mutation in the gene that codes for dystrophin, a protein that is important for maintaining the cellular architecture in myocytes. **ECG:** Duchenne muscular dystrophy leads to scarring of the posterior wall of the left ventricle leading to a prominent R wave in V1 just as scarring from a posterior wall myocardial infarction causes a positive R wave in V1. In addition, in some cases late activation of the posterior left ventricle will lead to a "spike" in the termnal portion of the QRS complex although this is a relatively uncommon finding. Now that

we have introduced some of the causes of a prominent R wave in V1 we can see that an increased rightward force can be seen in two situations. First, conditions such as right ventricular hypertrophy and dextrocardia where there is larger mass to the right of the chest and second, conditions such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy or a posterior wall myocardial infarction in which there is loss of myocardial tissue in the posterior portion of the left ventricle. **Clinical Issues:** Duchenne muscular dystrophy can be associated with heart failure in some cases due to progressive disease and also significant arrhythmias.

# Prominent R Wave (Narrow)

### Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

![](_page_32_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_32_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 7.17:**

**Background:** Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetic disorder due to mutations of proteins of the sarcomere (the actual structure that causes contraction). **ECG:** In some cases the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is most prominent in the left ventricular septum leading to a large initial left to right force that is also often oriented inferior to superior. This abnormal initial depolarization leads to a larger than expected septal r wave in V1, a larger than expected septal q wave in V6, and abnormal Q waves in the inferior leads. Compare this ECG to the normal variant ECG (Figure 7.11). Q waves in the inferolateral leads are present in both, but in this case of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy the Q waves are extremely deep (4 mm; as will be discussed in

Chapter 8, abnormal Q waves are defined by lead, width, and depth) and there are associated ST segment elevation in leads V1 and V2, abnormal left axis deviation, and T wave inversion in aVL. Always remember to evaluate a prominent R wave in the context of the "company it keeps," so this R wave in V1, although "normal" by voltage criteria, would be considered abnormal. **Clinical Issues:** Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be associated with significant shortness of breath due to pulmonary congestion from elevated left atrial pressures due to a thickened stiff left ventricle. In addition, patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are at higher risk for the development of ventricular arrhythmias.

### Hypothermia (Osborn Wave)

![](_page_34_Figure_4.jpeg)

### **Figure 7.18:**

**Background:** In severe cases of hypercalcemia and hypothermia, a distinctive bizarre late wave of depolarization can be observed that is often called an Osborn wave. **ECG:** The Osborn wave is usually seen in the precordial leads as large late positive deflection just after the QRS complex. Since it coincides with the J point (remember our discussion of ST segment depression; the J point is the point between the end of the QRS and the beginning of the ST segment), the Osborn wave is also called a J wave. The Osborn wave becomes progressively more

prominent as body temperature decreases and is seen very commonly when the body temperature is below 25° C. The specific cause of the Osborn wave has not been comprehensively studied but does appear to be mediated by abnormal function of K+ channels. In the leads where the Osborn wave is observed the T wave is usually inverted. **Clinical Issues:** If an Osborn wave is present on the ECG, the underlying cause-hypothermia or hypercalcemia is generally easily identified.
