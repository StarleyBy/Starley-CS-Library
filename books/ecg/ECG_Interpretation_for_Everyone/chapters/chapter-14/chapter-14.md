### **Clinical Use of the ECG: Clinical Problems**

The ECG is an extremely important diagnostic tool for patients who may have cardiac problems and for this "wrap-up" chapter it is useful to put the ECG in the context of its main clinical uses: Evaluating the patient with an ongoing arrhythmia, evaluating a patient who complains of symptoms in the past that may be due to arrhythmias (palpitations, dizziness), and evaluating a patient with chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of a cardiac problem.

### **Ongoing arrhythmia**

In the patient with an ongoing arrhythmia, simplistically the patent has a heart rate that is too slow, a heart rate that is too fast, or a heart rate that is normal but has skips or is irregular. Now that we have reviewed the different causes of arrhythmias we can modify Chapter 9, Figure 9.1 to include the specific arrhythmias (Figure 14.1). Slow heart rates (bradycardia) are either due to sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular block. The ECG helps identify if enough P waves are being generated and if P waves are present do they conduct normally to the ventricles.

In a patient with a rapid heart rate, the ECG is used to quantify the rate and rhythm, and perhaps most important, determine whether or not the ventricles are being depolarized normally or abnormally (Figure 14.1). If the QRS is narrow and normal appearing, the ventricles are being depolarized normally and the patient has supraventricular tachycardia. Although supraventricular tachycardia can be associated with significant symptoms, they are usually reasonably stable and generally not associated with hemodynamic collapse. In fact if the patient has a tachycardia not associated with a pulse, it suggests that some significant process other than arrhythmia is present (severe infection, severe blood loss, etc.). In

contrast, a wide complex tachycardia confirms that the heart is not being depolarized normally and the possibility of ventricular tachycardia must be the first thought that crosses the clinician's mind. Specific identification of the cause of the supraventricular tachycardia or wide complex tachycardia is covered in Chapter 11.

If the patient is complaining of an irregular heart beat, the ECG can identify whether the patient is in sinus rhythm with skips (either premature atrial contractions or premature ventricular contractions) or some other arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation is present (Figure 14.1).

### **Symptoms suggestive of a prior arrhythmia: syncope or palpitations**

Oftentimes patients come for evaluation of a problem they experienced in the past such as palpitations, dizziness, or syncope. Syncope is a medical term used for sudden loss of consciousness that is transient and often with a quick recovery. Syncope is extremely common and can have many causes. Generally most patients with syncope have a very good prognosis except for those patients that have syncope due to a cardiac problem, most commonly a transient arrhythmia. The ECG is an essential part of the initial evaluation of patients with syncope. The focus of the ECG is to identify patients who may have a cardiac cause of syncope (Figure 14.2). The ECG should be evaluated for depolarization abnormalities and repolarization abnormalities. Identification of an abnormal ECG makes a cardiac cause of syncope more likely.

### **Chest Pain**

Finally, the ECG remains one of the most important diagnostic tools for evaluating the patient with symptoms that may be due to cardiac ischemia (Figure 14.3). Although this is important, remember that the patient's description of their symptoms provides the most valuable clues for the cause of chest pain. Chest pain due to ischemia is generally described as a dull pressure in the central or left chest that may radiate to the arm or jaw. The pain lasts minutes or longer (rather than sharp stabbing pain for seconds) and generally does not change with a breath or with change in position.

The hallmark ECG changes associated with myocardial ischemia, injury, or infacrtion are changes in repolarization such as ST segment elevation, ST segment depression, or T wave changes (inversion and less commonly, peaking). The ST segment elevation associated with myocardial infarction

### **Figure 14.2:**

is present in two contiguous leads. The presence of reciprocal changes, T wave inversion or Q waves makes myocardial infarction and injury as the likely cause for ST segment elevation. Reciprocal changes (other than depression in aVR due to pericarditis) are particularly useful if they are present. But remember that the absence of reciprocal changes does not "rule out" myocardial injury as a cause of ST segment elevation, particularly for anterior wall myocardial infarctions. In Chapter 4, only very subtle reciprocal changes in the inferior leads are observed in Figure 4.8 and no reciprocal changes are present in Figure 4.10. Reciprocal changes are much more commonly observed in inferior wall myocardial infarctions (inferior ST segment elevation; reciprocal changes most commonly observed in V1 , V2 , I, and aVL) and lateral wall myocardial infarctions (lateral ST segment elevation; reciprocal changes in the inferior leads).

The evaluation of the ECG with only ST segment depression or T wave changes can be extremely challenging. In some cases, the ECG changes

can be extremely subtle, perhaps only present in one lead. For ST segment depression and T wave inversion, comparison with an old ECG or if the chest pain is "coming and going," associated dynamic ST segment and T wave changes should arouse suspicion for ischemia. The presence of left bundle branch block and left ventricular hypertrophy increase the likelihood that a patient has coronary artery disease or other cardiac abnormality but also make the ECG more difficult and sometimes impossible to evaluate for ischemia. Several final thoughts may help. First, more obvious ECG changes are more worrisome. The corollary of this is that for more subtle the ECG changes, either the ischemia is in a region in an area that is not "seen well" by the ECG (lateral wall), or, more likely, that the ischemia is not severe enough to be associated with large changes in repolarization or depolarization. Second, comparison ECGs, whether old or when the patient is experiencing different symptoms, may be helpful. Finally, listen to your patient and remember that symptoms always take precedence over ECG findings.

## **Figure 14.4:**

When comparing ECGs in a patient with chest pain, it is critical to evaluate the QRS complex, particularly in the precordial leads. In this example, the T wave appears more peaked in V3 when compared to a prior ECG. However, by

comparing the QRS complexes (RS rather than an rS), it is obvious that lead V3 from the prior ECG probably corresponds to lead V4 on the current ECG.

## **Figure 14.5:**

In this patient with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH by Romilt Estes criteria with STT changes and left atrial abnormality), the ECG with chest pain is associated with more prominent anterior T wave inversion. In this case, the patient had a significant lesion in his right coronary artery.

The location of T wave abnormalities and ST segment changes usually provides very little information on the location of the myocardium at risk. The ability to compare the current ECG is very helpful in this patient who has baseline abnormalities due to left ventricular hypertrophy.

## **Figure 14.6:**

In this patient with chest pain that is "coming and going," ECGs are obtained in the emergency department both with and without chest pain. Dynamic ECG changes associated with symptoms are extremely useful. In this case the T waves are more prominent in the anterior leads (\*). This patient

had a critical lesion in his left anterior descending coronary artery. T wave peaking is a T wave change that provides a clue to the anatomic location of the myocardium at risk. In this case, anterior T wave peaking due to anterior myocardial injury.

segment elevation may resolve immediately or over the next several hours and Q waves might resolve or never appear.
