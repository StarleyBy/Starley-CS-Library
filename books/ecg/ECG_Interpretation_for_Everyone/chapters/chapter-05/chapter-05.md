#### **Abnormal Repolarization: ST Segment Depression**

ST segment depression is also an important finding when evaluating the patient with chest pain. ST segment depression generally represents myocardial ischemia rather than myocardial injury. In this case, often a critical lesion is present, but some blood flow is reaching the endangered portions of the heart. Like ST segment elevation, ST segment depression can be observed in the anterior leads, the lateral leads, or the inferior leads. Unlike ST segment elevation, the location of ST segment depression does not correlate with the location of the myocardium at risk. For example, the presence of lateral ST segment depression can be due to significant lesions in the anterior descending, circumflex, or right coronary arteries. Isolated ST segment depression is most commonly observed in the lateral leads, but isolated inferior ST segment depression can also be observed. Isolated anterior ST segment depression is much less common (if anterior ST segment depression is observed, always check aVR for ST segment elevation and the possibility of a critical left main lesion or severe disease in all three coronary arteries (left anterior descending coronary artery, circumflex coronary artery, and right coronary artery) which some have called "left main equivalent").

The problem with using isolated ST segment depression as a specific sign for ischemia is that it may be present in some patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. High blood pressure or hypertension is an extremely common problem, with over 70% of people affected by age 70 years. Hypertension itself is not an issue; do you really feel the difference between a blood pressure of 140/90 and a blood pressure of 120/70? The problem is that hypertension causes damage to many organs including the heart, kidney, and brain. When contracting against higher pressures for an extended period of time, the heart responds by

**Table 5.1:** Factors determining whether abnormal ST segment depression is present and whether abnormal ST segment depression is more likely due to ischemia

#### **Is abnormal ST segment depression present?**

*(Yes to any questions means abnormal)*

- Is ST segment depression > 0.5 mm in V2 and V3, or > 1 mm in the other leads?
- Is the ST segment elevation present in two "adjacent" (contiguous) leads?

#### **Is the abnormal ST segment depression due to myocardial injury?**

*(Yes to any questions means that myocardial ischemia is a likely cause)*

- Is the ST depression new when compared to prior ECGs?
- Does the magnitude ST depression correlate with symptoms?
- Is the patient complaining of chest pain?
- Are Q waves present?

becoming larger and thicker. The larger and thicker heart leads to a characteristic set of changes that can be identified by ECG (Figure 5.6; Figures 8.12–8.14) but one of the changes is ST segment depression in the lateral leads. So here's the problem in a nutshell. Since hypertension is so common and some of these patients have left ventricular hypertrophy, if you were to evaluate 100 patients with ST segment depression the great majority would have lateral ST segment depression due to left ventricular hypertrophy rather than due to myocardial ischemia. In a patient complaining of chest pain, lateral ST segment depression becomes much more suspicious, particularly since hypertension is a risk factor for developing coronary artery disease. Clues for the evaluation of a patient with chest pain are summarized in Chapter 14.

ST segment depression is usually evaluated by determining the location of the J point, which is the point between the end of the QRS complex and the beginning of the ST segment. The threshold values for ST segment depression are the opposite of the threshold values for ST segment elevation. Since ST segment depression is extremely uncommon in V2 and V3 , J point depression > 0.5 mm is considered significant, while J point depression > 1 mm is considered significant for the rest of the leads. The characteristics of abnormal ST depression and clues for identifying whether ST depression is due to myocardial ischemia are summarized in Table 5.1. The reader will note that often deciding whether ST depression is due to ischemia often depends on comparison between ECGs: New vs. old; presence or absence of symptoms.

### **Figure 5.1:**

**Background:** Inferolateral ST segment depression may be associated with ischemia. In fact the presence of ST segment depression is one of the important ECG criteria used for stress testing to identify ischemia.

**ECG:** ST segment depression due to inferolateral ischemia can have many manifestations. In this example there is horizontal ST depression associated with T wave inversion in leads II, V5, and V6. Abnormal T wave inversion is also

present in I and aVL. The J point is the point where the QRS ends and the T wave begins and is where the magnitude of ST depression should be measured. **Clinical Issues:** ST segment depression can be seen in a number of different conditions. As discussed in Chapter 14, fluctuation of the ST changes with waxing and waning of chest pain ("dynamic ECG changes") should raise concern that the ECG changes represent ischemia.

### **Figure 5.2:**

**Background:** ST depression is more likely due to ischemia if there is other evidence that coronary artery disease is present. **ECG:** In this example ST depression is observed in the inferior leads, II, III, and aVF. Although the ST segments are "scooped" in the lateral leads the J point is only minimally depressed if at all. Unlike Figure 5.1, ST depression is not associated with changes in the T wave. In this example there are abnormal Q waves in V1 and V2. A Q wave is any initial negative wave. The Q wave in aVR is a normal finding since ventricular depolarization occurs from right to left. In

addition Q waves in I and aVL may be seen in 30–40% of asymptomatic patients with no cardiac disease. However, the Q waves in two adjacent leads V1 and V2 are abnormal and suggest the possibility of a prior myocardial infarction. Evidence for prior myocardial infarction always increases the likelihood that the ST segment depression (and for that matter any associated repolarization changes) represents ischemia. **Clinical Issues:** Again, if the patient is complaining of chest pain any ECG changes should be considered suspicious for ischemia.

ST segment depression due to ischemia (critical left main stenosis)

### **Figure 5.3:**

**Background:** The left main coronary artery provides blood to most of the anterior wall and lateral wall of the left ventricle. Although left main coronary artery occlusion is associated with ST segment elevation in lead aVR (see Chapter 4, Figure 4.29), it is included here because the lateral ST depression is often extremely prominent and because of the severity of the problem.

**ECG:** The ECG in left main coronary artery occlusion is characterized by ST segment elevation in lead aVR but profound

ST segment depression in the rest of the leads, particularly the anterolateral precordium (V4 to V6). **Clinical Issues:** Patients with possible left main coronary artery lesions must be treated aggressively and usually require urgent cardiac catheterization to define the coronary artery anatomy.

ST segment depression due to left bundle branch block

### **Figure 5.4:**

**Background:** In the presence of left bundle branch block the ECG can be very difficult to interpret since ST segment changes are very common. **ECG:** In general, in the presence of left bundle branch block, the ST segments will be elevated in the leads with a negative QRS complex and depressed in those leads with a

positive QRS complex. For example in this case the downsloping ST segments and inverted T waves in I, aVL, and V6 are all expected findings. **Clinical Issues:** ST segment changes are extremely difficult to evaluate in the setting of bundle branch block, particularly in left bundle branch block.

### **Figure 5.5:**

**Background:** In the presence of left bundle branch block the ECG can be very difficult to interpret. **ECG:** In general, in the presence of left bundle branch block, the ST segments will be elevated in the leads with a negative QRS complex and depressed in those leads with a positive QRS complex. The presence of ST segment depression in a lead with a negative QRS complex would be "unexpected" and should arouse suspicion for ischemia, particularly if the patient is complaining of chest pain. In the example, the ST segment depression in leads I and aVL would be expected

since the QRS complex is positive; however, the ST segment depression in leads V2 through V5 is worrisome for ischemia since the QRS complex is negative. **Clinical Issues:** In left bundle branch block, the presence of ST segment depression in a lead with a negative QRS complex should arouse suspicion if the patient is complaining of chest pain. The clinician should always remember the limitations of the ECG for evaluating ST segment changes in the setting of left bundle branch block.

ST segment depression due to left ventricular hypertrophy

![](_page_12_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_12_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 5.6:**

**Background:** Left ventricular hypertrophy, usually due to hypertension, can be associated with repolarization changes and lateral ST segment depression. **ECG:** The ST segment depression in left ventricular hypertrophy is usually downsloping. In this example, ST segment depression is noted in V5 and V6 and aVL. The key to identifying left ventricular hypertrophy as the cause of lateral ST segment depression generally includes identifying other ECG signs of left ventricular hypertrophy, including

prominent QRS voltages in the lateral leads with large R waves and the presence of a biphasic P wave in lead V1. In this case, the patient is in atrial fibrillation so P waves are not present. **Clinical Issues:** The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy suggests that the left ventricle is contracting against a large afterload (systemic hypertension, aortic stenosis) that leads to a compensatory increase in left ventricular wall thickness.

ST segment depression due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

![](_page_14_Figure_4.jpeg)

### **Figure 5.7:**

**Background:** There are several different forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Chapter 4, Figure 4.14) that are classified by the location of the thickest region of the left ventricle. The most common form is generalized hypertrophy but sometimes the hypertrophy is disproportionately prominent in specific areas such as the septum or apex. The apical hypertrophy form is associated with lateral T wave inversion and may have ST segment depression.

**ECG:** Deep symmetric T wave inversion in V5 and V6 is characteristic and may be associated with mild ST segment depression (usually less than 1 mV). **Clinical Issues:** Patients with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be asymptomatic or complain of shortness of breath due to the stiffer left ventricle and lung congestion due to increased left atrial and pulmonary venous pressures. Patients also are at higher risk for ventricular arrhythmias.

### ST segment depression due to digoxin

![](_page_16_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 5.8:**

**Background:** Digoxin is a drug that is used to control heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation and now, much less commonly for the treatment of heart failure.

**ECG:** Although less commonly used today, digoxin is associated with characteristic ECG changes, in particular, downsloping of the lateral ST segments similar to what is observed in left ventricular hypertrophy but has a fairly

characteristic "rounded" or "scooped" appearance. Notice that the J point itself is not depressed – rather there is "sagging" of the middle of the ST segment. **Clinical Issues:** The ECG changes associated with digoxin are very commonly observed. Digoxin can be used in patients with heart failure, particularly if they also have atrial fibrillation.
