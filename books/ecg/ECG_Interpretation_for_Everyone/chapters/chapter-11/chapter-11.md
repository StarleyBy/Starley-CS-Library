#### **CHAPTER 11**

#### **Arrhythmias: Tachycardia**

Okay, take a very deep breath as this chapter is by far and away the most difficult to get through (hopefully you are not already grumbling "Oh dear, the first ten were awfully tough"). At first glance, the material appears very dense with a lot of information. Sadly you might be right about the quantity of material, but it is hoped this chapter will provide an outline to make the material easier to organize. However, the ECG is the fundamental diagnostic tool for evaluating rapid heart rates. In fact, if at all possible (sometimes the clinician is limited because of hemodynamic collapse), any patient who is thought to have an abnormal rapid heart rate should receive a 12 lead ECG as soon as possible. Once mastered, the ability to quickly evaluate an ECG is an essential skill necessary for taking care of critically ill patients.

From an anatomic standpoint, rapid heart rates can be due to abnormally rapid activity from three sites: the atria, AV junction, or the ventricles. The fourth cause of tachycardia uses an abnormal muscular connection between the atria and ventricles (accessory pathway) that is used as the essential component in the tachycardia (Figure 11.1).

Although this anatomic classification is extremely helpful for remembering the different types of tachycardia and will be used for the remainder of the chapter, clinically the ECG is used to make a distinction between narrow complex tachycardias and wide complex tachycardias. In narrow complex tachycardia, the QRS has a normal appearance with an rS complex in V1 and a width < 0.12 s. The normal QRS complex means that the ventricles are being activated normally using the His Purkinje tissue and generally rules out a tachycardia arising solely from ventricular tissue (ventricular tachycardia). In wide complex tachycardias, the focus will be on deciding whether the patient has ventricular

Anatomic types of tachycardia. The ventricular tachycardias and the accessory pathway mediated tachycardias in which the ventricles are activated by the accessory pathway always are associated with a wide complex tachycardia (Wide QRS tachycardia). The other tachycardias are usually associated with a narrow QRS tachycardia and are grouped together as supraventricular tachycardias. Any supraventricular tachycardia can be associated with aberrant conduction and produce a wide complex tachycardia.

tachycardia or one of the supraventricular tachycardias with abnormal or aberrant conduction. Ventricular tachycardia is generally more likely to be life-threatening, while the supraventricular tachycardia, although it may be associated with significant symptoms, is generally better tolerated. The presence of a narrow QRS on the ECG is a first form of "triage," and essentially rules out ventricular tachycardia.

Narrow QRS tachycardias are generally grouped together and called supraventricular tachycardias, to emphasize that ventricular tachycardia is not present. If we return to our anatomic classification scheme, supraventricular tachycardia can have three anatomic causes: atrial tachycardias, junctional tachycardias, or accessory pathway mediated tachycardias. In atrial tachycardia, the cause of tachycardia is solely within atrial tissue. This could be a site or sites within the atria that are depolarizing (or "firing") abnormally fast or a reentrant circuit within the atria.

We now have to take a slight "detour" and talk about the difference between automaticity and reentry (Figure 11.2). Automaticity is very easy to understand conceptually as a single or several rapidly blinking lights that cause rapid atrial activity. On the other hand, reentry is not very intuitive and can be one of the most confusing subjects for students learning about arrhythmias. However, a cursory understanding of reentry is necessary for analyzing the ECG. In reentry a "substrate" consisting of two parallel pathways with connected ends and different electrical properties is present. Generally, a wave of activation travels through both sides of the pathway equally. But a premature stimulation can lead to conduction down only one pathway, due to block in the other pathway. In some cases, the impulse can turn around and travel backwards up the parallel pathway, setting up a continual loop of depolarization. The analogy that is often used is a dog chasing its tail. The electrical activity continues to circle on the two pathways until one of the arms blocks suddenly and the tachycardia stops. Tachycardias due to reentry tend to start suddenly and stop abruptly. Although it might not first seem obvious, parallel electrical pathways are quite common in the diseased heart due to the development of scar tissue and natural barriers, e.g. the entrance of the *vena cavae* into the right atrium (see the discussion on atrial flutter which follows).

So now back to our discussion of atrial tachcardias. An atrial tachycardia due to a single rapidly depolarizing site is formally called a focal atrial tachycardia, although to add to the confusion these arrhythmias are often just called atrial tachycardias. If three or more sites are depolarizing

![](_page_3_Picture_2.jpeg)

#### **Figure 11.2:**

The two cellular/tissue causes of tachycardia are automaticity and reentry. In automaticity a site or sites within the heart begins to depolarize abnormally fast. In this example an automatic site is located within the atria. In reentry, a "substrate" of two parallel "pathways" is present. The pathways can be anywhere and are separated by fibrosis or a normal anatomic structure (e.g. the

inferior vena cava). In this example the two "pathways" are shown in the right atrium. A premature beat blocks in one "pathway" and conducts in only one "pathway." The wave of depolarization turns around by depolarizing the other "pathway" and a reentrant circuit develops. Reentry requires both "substrate"-two pathways with different electrical properties and a "trigger" to initiate the reentry.

abnormally, the arrhythmia is called a multifocal atrial tachycardia. An atrial tachycardia due to reentry within atrial tissue is called atrial flutter (Figure 11.1).

Tachycardias that arise from junctional tissue are usually due to small reentrant circuits that are confined to the AV node and adjacent atrial tissue (AV node reentrant tachycardia or AVNRT). In rare cases (usually children), an unusual arrhythmia called junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) due to an automatic focus from junctional tissue can be observed (Figure 11.1).

The final distinct anatomic cause of supraventricular tachycardia uses an accessory pathway. Usually the AV node is the only electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles, but in some cases a strand of tissue that forms an additional electrical connection between the atria and ventricles called an accessory pathway is present (Chapter 7, Figures 7.9 and 7.10 and Chapter 8, Figure 8.3). The coexistence of the AV node and an accessory pathway are the perfect conditions for the development of reentry. Under normal conditions, atrial depolarization travels down both the accessory pathway and the AV node to depolarize the ventricles. A premature atrial contraction can sometimes block in the accessory pathway and conduct solely down the AV node to activate the ventricles. Ventricular depolarization may activate the ventricular end of the accessory pathway and the depolarization can travel "backwards" up the accessory pathway to depolarize the atria and initiate a reentrant circuit (the dog chasing its tail). This type of tachycardia is called atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia or AVRT and leads to a rapid supraventricular tachycardia since the ventricles are being depolarized normally via the AV node and His Purkinje system.

Although there are obvious complexities and subtleties, in general, when evaluating a supraventricular tachycardia there are two considerations: determining whether the rhythm is regular or irregular and identifying atrial activity.

Irregular supraventricular tachycardias are generally due to tachycardias from rapid atrial activity (atrial tachycardias) (Table 11.1). Rapid atrial activity can have several forms. The most common cause of an irregular supraventricular tachycardia is atrial fibribrillation where irregular, continuous, and chaotic atrial activity called fibrillatory waves is observed. In atrial fibrillation, the pulse and ventricular rhythm is extremely irregular because of irregular activation of the ventricles via the AV node. Several other forms of rapid atrial activity can also cause irregular rhythms. In multifocal atrial tachycardia, several different sites within the atria alternatively activate the atria. Think of rapidly blinking lights from different sites and rates within the atria. Both atrial fibrillation and multifocal atrial tachycardia cause irregular rapid heart rhythms, and the distinction between the two is made by the ECG. In multifocal atrial tachycardia, the

atria are depolarized as a single wave, albeit at abnormal rates and from different sites, so discrete P waves of different shapes are observed. In atrial fibrillation, the atria are not depolarized as single waves of activity and rather by continuous ever-changing smaller waves of activity. One way to think about the differences between multifocal atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation is the motion of water at the beach or in a rapidly flowing river. At the beach, waves break at irregular intervals but between the waves there is no activity. In contrast, in a rapidly flowing river, multiple different waves are continuously slowing in an ever-changing pattern with no quiescent period.

Usually focal atrial tachycardias and atrial flutters lead to regular rapid rhythms but in some cases regular rapid atrial activity can lead to some irregularity of the QRS complexes due to variable conduction. However, even in this case there will be periods of regular tachycardia, and when an irregular tachycardia develops fixed intervals will still be observed since the atria are being depolarized regularly. This pattern is often called "regularly irregular" to differentiate it from atrial fibrillation and multifocal atrial tachycardia which are associated with very irregular QRS rhythms because the atria are being activated irregularly (often referred to as "irregularly irregular"). In some cases of atrial fibrillation, large areas of tissue are activated relatively regularly, leading to the appearance of larger "flutter" waves, particularly in lead V1 , and this is sometimes called "coarse" atrial fibrillation. The distinction between atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation is usually made by the QRS rhythm; if the QRS rhythm is irregularly irregular, it is classified as atrial fibrillation, and if there is some pattern of regularity, it is called atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia.

A regular supraventricular tachycardia can be caused by a regular atrial tachycardia or atrial flutter, a rhythm arising from the AV junction, and finally in one of the tachycardias that use an accessory pathway. Atrial tachycardia and atrial flutter have already been described and if AV conduction is constant, a regular tachycardia is observed. In most cases every other depolarization of atrium conducts to the ventricle (2:1 conduction). For example, the most common form of atrial flutter depolarizes the atrium at a regular rate of 300 beats per minute, if every other depolarization is conducted to the ventricles, the resulting ventricular rate will be 150 beats per minute. Fast but probably a lot more stable than a heart rate of 300 bpm! Careful inspection of the ECG is required to identify the P waves.

Tachycardias arising from the AV junction area are usually due to a small reentrant circuit due to small parallel inputs into or within the AV node. Since the junction is driving the heart, the ventricles are activated via the His Purkinje system and the atria are activated "backwards" from the AV node region. Since the atria and ventricles are activated simultaneously the P wave is sometimes obscured by the QRS complex or seen at the end of the QRS complex.

As discussed previously in this chapter, patients with an accessory pathway can develop supraventricular tachycardia. In contrast to tachycardias arising from the junction the ventricles and atria are activated sequentially one after the other. For this reason, the P waves are typically observed after the QRS complex within the ST segment. As will be emphasized in the figures, identification of the P waves can provide important clues for determining what type of tachycardia is present.

One last confusing point about supraventricular tachycardias is the "alphabet soup" of abbreviations used to describe them:

 SVT: Supraventricular tachycardia – a generic term used to describe any fast heart rhythm with a normal QRS complex.

 PSVT: Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia – an SVT that occurs sporadically and starts suddenly and stops suddenly.

 AVNRT: AV node reentrant tachycardia – a reentrant tachycardia with all of the components for the reentrant circuit within the AV node and /or adjacent tissue.

 AVRT: Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia – a reentrant tachycardia that uses an accessory pathway and the AV node as two "limbs" of a reentrant circuit.

 ORT: Orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia – the specific form of AVRT in which the AV node activates the ventricles and the accessory pathway activates the atria. The term "ortho" comes from the Greek word "normal or standard" and "dromic" for direction to describe the normal direction of AV conduction in this type of tachycardia that results in a narrow complex tachycardia.

A wide QRS tachycardia is also called wide complex tachycardia. In this case, the ventricles are not being activated normally by the His Purkinje system. Any of the supraventricular tachycardias can cause a wide QRS tachycardia if there is abnormal or aberrant conduction in the His Purkinje system, often collectively referred to as "SVT with aberrancy." But wide QRS tachycardia can also be caused by rapid ventricular activation due to automaticity or a reentrant circuit within ventricular tissue. Any tachycardia that is due solely to abnormal activation of ventricular tissue is called ventricular tachycardia. Although both SVT with aberrancy and ventricular tachycardia can be associated with significant symptoms, rapid identification of ventricular tachycardia is critical since ventricular tachycardia is often unstable and can lead to sudden death. For this reason, the ECG is very useful for first identifying whether a tachycardia is wide complex or narrow complex (SVT) and second, for differentiating between ventricular tachycardia and SVT with aberrancy. The ECG clues for identifying ventricular tachycardia are provided in Figures 11.17 through 11.24.

facilitate development of blood clots. If the blood clot travels (embolizes) to the brain, blood supply to a part

of the brain is lost, and a stroke develops.

#### **Figure 11.3:**

**Background:** Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia in medicine. In atrial fibrillation there are several simultaneous waves of atrial depolarization that change and depolarize the atria in a random fashion.

**ECG:** The ECG in atrial fibrillation shows chaotic atrial activity with no "quiescent" period at baseline because of continuous depolarization of the atria. The ventricles depolarize irregularly due to irregular activation of the AV node and His Purkinje system. The ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation depends on AV node function. If the AV node is diseased or abnormal due to drug, the ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation will be normal or even slow (Chapter 9, Figure 9.13 and Chapter 10, Figure 10.12).

**Clinical Issues:** Atrial fibrillation can lead to significant tiredness and fatigue due to the rapid ventricular rate and loss of atrial contribution to ventricular filling. However, in some cases patients are only minimally symptomatic and in some cases completely asymptomatic. The severity of symptoms is most dependent on the ventricular rate; the more rapid the ventricular rate the more likely the patient will have symptoms. The main clinical issue with atrial fibrillation is increased risk of stroke. Since the atria are not contracting normally, blood pooling on the left atrium can

Discrete atrial activity with ≥ 3 P wave shapes

#### **Figure 11.5:**

**Background:** Multifocal atrial tachycardia is usually observed in critically ill patients in the setting of decreased oxygen due to pneumonia or other pulmonary process or severe electrolyte disorders. It is most commonly observed in those patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. **ECG:** In multifocal atrial tachycardia three or more unique sites are depolarizing the atrium at different rates. This leads to irregular P waves of different shapes separated by

isoelectric periods. Since atrial depolarization is irregular, ventricular depolarization is also irregular. **Clinical Issues:** In and of itself, multifocal atrial tachycardia does not require specific treatment but the underlying cause, hypoxia, acidosis or other electrolyte disorder must be determined and appropriately treated. Multifocal atrial tachycardia may progress to atrial fibrillation (where organized atrial depolarization is lost).

![](_page_14_Figure_4.jpeg)

#### **Figure 11.6:**

**Background:** In atrial flutter a stable reentrant circuit leads to rapid atrial activity. **ECG:** The atrial activity is rapid and regular. In the most common form of atrial flutter, the reentrant circuit circles around the tricuspid valve. From our prior discussion on reentry the tricuspid valve forms an anatomic barrier that separates two "pathways." One "pathway" is formed from the narrow strip of tissue that separates the inferior *vena cava* from the tricuspid valve and the other "pathway" is simply the remaining atrial tissue. A premature atrial contraction leads to initiation of a stable reentrant circuit. Typically, depolarization of the interatrial septum and the left atrium travels from "low to high" and deeply negative flutter wavesare observed in the inferior leads. Like atrial

fibrillation, in atrial flutter there is continuous atrial depolarization, at any point in time some portion of the atria are being depolarized. For this reason, in cases of typical atrial flutter, the flatter period between the negative flutter waves actually shows a slight negative slope. Unlike atrial fibrillation, in atrial flutter depolarization of the atria occurs via a stable reentrant circuit leading that produces regular flutter waves. The ventricular rate may be regular or irregular depending on whether there is consistent conduction via the AV node. **Clinical Issues:** In atrial flutter, like atrial fibrillation, treatment generally focuses on slowing AV conduction to restore a more normal ventricular t=rate and protecting against stroke with medications.

## Irregular Narrow QRS tachycardia Atrial fibrillation ("coarse")

![](_page_16_Figure_4.jpeg)

#### **Figure 11.7:**

In some cases atrial fibrillation will have periods of relatively regular activity with relatively regular waves that appear to be atrial flutter. In fact it is not uncommon for a patient to transition between periods of atrial flutter and periods of atrial fibrillation. More commonly, atrial fibrillation will become more organized for a period so that the atria are being activated in a relatively constant repetitive manner. Generally the distinction between atrial fibillation and atrial flutter is made indirectly by evaluating the QRS rhythm. In

atrial flutter, although the rhythm may be irregular there are relatively few constant intervals of ventricular activation since ventricular irregularity is dependent only on changing atrioventricular conduction. In contrast in atrial fibrillation the irregular ventricular rhythm is due to both irregular atrial depolarization and varying atrioventricular conduction. This example would be classified as atrial fibrillation since although there are a few relatively fixed QRS intervals, in general the ventricular rhythm is very irregular.

## Regular Narrow QRS tachycardia Focal atrial tachycardia

![](_page_18_Figure_4.jpeg)

#### **Figure 11.8:**

**Background:** Focal atrial tachycardias are relatively rare but probably account for approximately 10% of regular rapid rhythms encountered in clinical medicine. **ECG:** Usually focal atrial tachycardias are nonsustained but in some cases sustained focal atrial tachycardia is observed. Focal atrial tachycardias are generally identified by a higher than expected rate and a P wave shape that suggests that the sinus node is not generating atrial depolarization. In this ECG, the patient's heart rate is approximately 120 beats per minute despite resting flat on a table. The P waves are inverted in I

and aVL due to an abnormal atrial focus in the left atrium. Later when an ECG is recorded in normal sinus rhythm, a slower heart rate with a P wave with the expected shape is observed. Comparing P wave morphologies (circles) during tachycardia and during sinus rhythm is extremely helpful. **Clinical Issues:** Generally atrial tachycardias are nonsustained and often no specific treatment is required. In some cases of incessant arrhythmias, medications to suppress the arrhythmia or an ablation procedure to eliminate the tachycardia site are recommended.

![](_page_20_Figure_3.jpeg)

#### **Figure 11.9:**

In this example of unsustained focal atrial tachycardia, the tachycardia terminates and allows comparison between atrial tachycardia and sinus rhythm in the same strip. If the rate of the focal atrial tachycardia is fast enough, not every atrial depolarization will conduct to the ventricles to produce a QRS complex. Remember this represents normal AV node function and does not imply AV nodal disease. Blocked

P waves can be identified by comparing the QRS complex and T waves during tachycardia with the QRS and T wave during sinus rhythm. In this case a deflection in the terminal portion of the QRS during tachycardia is not observed during sinus rhythm (?) and must have represented atrial depolarization that did not conduct to the ventricles.

![](_page_22_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_22_Figure_5.jpeg)

## **Figure 11.10:**

**Background:** AV node reentrant tachycardia (often called AVNRT) is the most common cause of rapid regular heart rates in young adults. It is more common in women than men. **ECG:** In AV node reentrant tachycardia, a reentrant circuit within the AV node and adjacent tissue leads to a rapid narrow complex tachycardia. The rapid activity from the AV node leads to retrograde activation of the atria and almost simultaneous activation of the ventricles. The P wave is often obscured but may be seen as a small r' wave in lead V1. It is extremely useful to compare the ECG in tachycardia

to the ECG in sinus rhythm. In this example the top four rows show the ECG during tachycardia and the bottom four rows show the ECG during sinus rhythm after the tachycardia has resolved. The retrograde P wave (\*) can be seen slightly after the QRS complex. **Clinical Issues:** AVNRT is not associated with life threatening problems, but if the episodes of tachycardia are frequent enough can lead to significant reduction in quality of life. Emergently, AVNRT is treated with intravenous adenosine that will often terminate the reentrant loop by causing transient block within the AV node.

## Regular Narrow QRS tachycardia

## Automatic junctional tachycardia

![](_page_24_Figure_4.jpeg)

## **Figure 11.11:**

**Background:** The spontaneous depolarization rate of the AV node is 35–50bpm. A much rarer cause of tachycardia from the AV nodal region is increased automaticity. **ECG:** Increased automaticity from the AV node results in a narrow complex tachycardia that is not preceded by P waves. By ECG it is impossible to differentiate between increased automaticity and reentry from the AV node. However, automatic junctional tachycardia is more commonly associated with retrograde atrial block. When retrograde block is present there are fewer P waves than

QRS complexes. In this example P waves can be seen between some but not all the QRS complexes. **Clinical Issues:** Increased automaticity of the AV node can be seen in two very different conditions. In newborns rapid automaticity from the AV node can be observed. It is often transient, but in some cases, particularly if it is associated with other heart abnormalities, it will continue and require drug treatment. In adults that have undergone cardiac surgery, transient automaticity from the AV node may develop but rarely requires treatment.

## Regular Narrow QRS tachycardia Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT)

![](_page_26_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_26_Figure_5.jpeg)

## **Figure 11.12:**

**Background:** Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) due to an accessory pathway is the second most common cause of episodes of rapid regular heart rates in young adults (after AVNRT). **ECG:** An accessory pathway can be involved in several different tachycardias. In the most common form, a reentrant circuit develops where the AV node and His bundle depolarize the ventricles and the atria are depolarized by the accessory pathway. This leads to a narrow complex tachycardia, that is often called orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia or ORT because the AV node is activated normally ("ortho") and the atria and ventricles are depolarized in a "back and forth" or reciprocating fashion. Since the atria are depolarized after the ventricles, the P wave is usually seen in the ST segment.

**Clinical Issues:** Emergently, almost any regular tachycardia is treated with adenosine. Adenosine will usually terminate AVNRT or AVRT by blocking conduction in the AV node, which will suddenly stop the reentrant circuit. Sometimes there is confusion on whether adenosine can be used safely in the setting of an accessory pathway because of concern about more rapid activation of the ventricles via the accessory pathway. Remember this is a concern only if the patient has atrial fibrillation or flutter and the ventricles are activated both via the accessory pathway and the AV node (Figures 11.1 and 11.29). This condition leads to a rapid irregular tachycardia with a wide QRS complex. In ORT, since the accessory pathway is conducting "backwards" and activating the atria in a regular fashion, adenosine will usually terminate the tachycardia without any problems.

![](_page_28_Figure_4.jpeg)

## **Figure 11.13:**

In any patient with a supraventricular tachycardia, comparing an ECG during tachycardia and sinus rhythm is extremely useful. The location of the P wave during tachycardia can be more easily identified by carefully identifying any differences in the QRS, ST segment, or T wave (circles). In this patient with an accessory pathway, notice that the baseline QRS during sinus rhythm has a normal PR interval and no delta wave (Chapter 7, Figures 7.9 and 7.10; Chapter 8,

Figure 8.3). In some cases the accessory pathway is a "one way street" rather than a "two way street." In this case, the accessory pathway can conduct retrogradely to depolarize the atria but cannot depolarize the ventricles during sinus rhythm. An accessory pathway with these properties is called "concealed" because it is only is apparent during tachycardia.

![](_page_30_Picture_2.jpeg)

## **Figure 11.14:**

Wide complex tachycardia may be due to ventricular tachycardia (a) or any type of supraventrciular tachycardia in which the ventricles are depolarized abnormally. The most common form of aberrant conduction is block in one of the bundles leading to a tachycardia with right bundle branch block or left bundle branch block (b). A rarer form of abnormal ventricular depolarization is the presence of an accessory pathway (c). In this case the accessory pathway allows rapid atrial depolarization to be transmitted to the

ventricles leading to a rapid wide complex (since the His Purkinje system is not used) tachycardia. Of these three choices it is important to identify ventricular tachycardia and atrial tachycardia with depolarization of the ventricles via an accessory pathway. Both of these conditons if left untreated can lead to life-threatening consequences. (Used with permission from FM Kusumoto, *Cardiovascular Pathophysiology*, Hayes Barton Press, Raleigh, NC, 2004.)

Monomorphic VT Polymorphic VT (Ventricular Fibrillation)

## **Figure 11.15:**

Ventricular tachycardia (and atrial fibrillation with rapid conduction via an accessory pathway) may deteriorate to ventricular fibrillation. In ventricular tachycardia the QRS complexes, although rapid and bizarre, all have the same morphology because the ventricles are being depolarized from a single source. In ventricular fibrillation, multiple waves of ventricular depolarization are present leading to rapid and irregular ventricular activity that changes the

shape of ventricular activity recorded by the ECG. Sometimes the word polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is used to describe a tachycardia that has rapid and irregular ventricular activity but with larger swings away from the baseline. For the practical purposes of our discussion, there is no difference between ventricular fibrillation and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Both are life-threatening and signal impending death.

![](_page_34_Figure_4.jpeg)

## **Figure 11.16:**

Sometimes external sources or problems can lead to apparent wide complex tachycardia. The presence of artifact can usually be determined by identifying narrow QRS complexes (\*) at constant intervals (double headed arrows) within the "wide complex tachycardia." Obviously, if the ECG changes

are due to artifact the patient will not have associated symptoms. But remember the opposite statement is not true. Many wide complex arrhythmias (both ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction) may be associated with minimal or no symptoms.

![](_page_36_Figure_2.jpeg)

## **Figure 11.17:**

Once it is established that a wide complex tachycardia is present, the ECG may be extremely valuable for identifying the presence of ventricular tachycardia. Again before evaluating the ECG ask "How's the patient doing?" Obviously if the rhythm is associated with significant

hemodynamic compromise (low blood pressure and symptoms), it really doesn't matter what the rhythm is, normal rhythm must be restored quickly. Quick restoration of normal rhythm often requires cardioversion where a large

shock is applied to the heart.

## Wide QRS tachycardia

## Ventricular Tachycardia (AV dissociation)

![](_page_38_Figure_4.jpeg)

III

## **Figure 11.18:**

The best way to identify ventricular tachycardia is to find evidence that atrial and ventricular activity do not depend on each other and are depolarizing independently (atrioventricular dissociation or AV dissociation). In the setting of a wide complex tachycardia, the presence of atrioventricular dissociation means that a site in the ventricles is driving cardiac activity. P waves are best identified by examining the inferior leads and lead V1 for any "unexpected" deflections. If you think back to Figure 11.11, automatic junctional tachycardias can also cause AV dissociation, but in this case a narrow QRS tachycardia with more QRS complexes than P waves is observed.

It is important to emphasize the value of AV dissociation for the diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia. Oftentimes when evaluating the ECG, the natural response is to look for P waves in their expected location since this is how we evaluate ECGs with normal rates. However, in any tachycardia the P waves are often difficult to separate from the T waves. When confronted with a wide complex tachycardia it is best to take a "wide angle" view of the entire ECG and look for the "unexpected deflections" that represent AV dissociation and confirm the presence of ventricular tachycardia.

Wide QRS tachycardia Ventricular Tachycardia (AV dissociation identified by capture beats)

![](_page_40_Figure_4.jpeg)

## **Figure 11.19:**

Atrioventricular dissociation can also be identified if a QRS complex with a different shape, usually more normal appearing, is identified. This more normal QRS complex occurs because a P wave is able to conduct to the ventricles are partially depolarize the ventricles. If the beat is completely normal appearing it is called a "capture beat" and if the beat has an intermediate shape between the QRS of ventricular tachycardia and a normal QRS it is called a "fusion beat." Both capture beats and fusion beats are

indirect evidence of atrioventricular dissociation and the presence of ventricular tachycardia. In this example of ventricular tachycardia, the two more normal appearing beats (\*) would be called capture or fusion beats since QRS changes can be seen in V1 and V2. This tachycardia also has an absent RS complex in the precordial leads which is another clue that ventricular tachycardia is present

(Figure 11.21).

## **Figure 11.20:**

If atrioventricular dissociation cannot be identified the clinician must depend on evaluation of the QRS (collectively called morphology clues) to help identify ventricular tachycardia. One of the most useful though uncommon

morphology clues is the presence of precordial concordance. In negative concordance all of the QRS complexes are negative and in positive concordance all of the QRS complexes are positive.

![](_page_44_Figure_4.jpeg)

## **Figure 11.21:**

Another useful morphology clue is the absence of an RS complex in the precordial leads. This finding is related to

concordance but in this case some of the QRS complexes can be negative and some of the QRS complexes positive.

Another useful morphology clue is a right superior cardiac axis in the frontal leads, also colloquially called a "northwest" axis. As you know the cardiac axis is normally between −30° and 100°. If the QRS is between −90° and −180° then

depolarization of the ventricles must be starting near the apex of the heart and it is unlikely that any form of aberrant conduction could cause initial ventricular depolarization "out there" near the tip (apex) of the heart.

## **Figure 11.23:**

Wide complex tachycardias are generally classified as left bundle branch block morphology if the QRS in V1 is predominantly negative or right bundle branch block morphology if the QRS complex in V1 is predominantly positive (Chapter 7, Figure 7.3). Supraventricular tachycardia with left bundle branch block aberrancy is associated with a small, sharp, and thin septal R wave in V1. In this example of AVRT with left bundle branch block aberrancy a sharp narrow septal R wave in V1 is present. In this case it is

extremely difficult to definitively say that the patient has supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy. Whenever there is ANY doubt, treat the patient as if he or she has ventricular tachycardia. In addition, the diagnosis of AVRT cannot be made by evaluating the ECG. In this case the exact mechanism of the tachycardia was identified by an electrophsiology study (an invasive procedure that allows the best delineation of arrhythmias by using plastic coated electrodes placed directly within the chambers of the heart).

## **Figure 11.24:**

In a wide complex tachycardia with a right bundle branch block pattern, supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy is more likely if the ECG has an rSR' complex with the second positive deflection (R') is larger than the first positive deflection (r). In this example of AVRT with right bundle branch block aberrancy (Just like Figure 11.23, an

electrophysiology study was required to make a definitive diagnosis), a large wide R' in V1 is observed. It is worth repeating that whenever there is any doubt, it is best to assume any wide complex tachycardia is ventricular tachycardia.

## **Figure 11.25:**

In some cases, the initiation of the wide complex tachycardia is available for evaluation. Ventricular tachycardia almost always is initiated with a premature ventricular contraction.

In this example, a relatively slow ventricular tachycardia is initiated with a premature ventricular depolarization.

## **Figure 11.26:**

Evaluation of a wide complex tachycardia in the setting of a preexisting bundle branch block can sometimes be difficult. In this example, the tachycardia starts with ventricular depolarization and during the tachycardia AV dissociation is present with more QRS complexes than P waves. In addition, notice that the patient has left bundle branch block

morphology at baseline (the first negative QRS complex). When tachycardia starts the QRS complex has a different morphology. A wide complex tachycardia associated with a change in QRS morphology more likely represents ventricular tachycardia.

## **Figure 11.27:**

Ventricular tachycardia requires urgent treatment with medications and in many case requires delivering a large electrical current between two paddles or pads placed on the chest. This large electrical current "resets" the heart and hopefully extinguishes all waves of cardiac depolarization (both atrial and ventricular). Hopefully "when the dust clears," the patient's normal rhythm resumes. In this example a patient has ventricular tachycardia due to a reentrant circuit involving a scar from a prior myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarctions can cause patchy scarring

reentry (two electrically isolated parallel paths that have different electrical properties). A premature ventricular contraction acts as a "trigger" and initiates the reentrant circuit. A high voltage current is delivered across the myocardium via external pads that "resets" the heart and the sinus node begins to drive the heart (\*). The sharp reader will notice that the first beat after the shock is actually from ventricular tissue with an inverted P wave in the ST segment due to retrograde conduction.

## Torsades de Pointes

## **Figure 11.28:**

One special form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is called Torsades de Pointes ("Twisting of the Points"). In this arrhythmia, prolongation of the QT interval leads to reactivation of the heart and leads to a characteristic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that has an undulating pattern that appears to be twisting around a central axis. Although

Torsades de Pointes may terminate spontaneously it must be treated aggressively by evaluating any cause for the prolonged QT interval such as hypokalemia or drugs. In this example the patient has an extremely prolonged QT interval of 0.60 s.

Atrial fibrillation and WPW (Rapid ventricular depolarizationvia the AP)

## **Figure 11.29:**

The final major cause of a wide complex tachycardia is atrial fibrillation in the presence of an accessory pathway (Wolff Parkinson White Syndrome; Figures 11.1 and 11.14). Remember that the AV node has slow conduction properties that limit the ventricular rate if atrial fibrillation or other atrial arrhythmias develop. However, an accessory pathway allows rapid conduction so if a patient with the Wolff Parkinson White Syndrome develops atrial fibrillation very

rapid ventricular rates up to 300 beats per minute can be intermittently present. The triad of an irregular very fast wide complex tachycardia should always arouse suspicion that a patient with an accessory pathway has developed atrial fibrillation. Since the ventricles are being rapidly depolarized this rhythm can deteriorate to ventricular fibrillation and must be treated urgently with either medication or cardioversion.
