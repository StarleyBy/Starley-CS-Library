#### **Arrhythmias: Pacing**

Implantable cardiac devices are now used for several different functions. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are designed to automatically detect ventricular tachyarrhythmias and deliver therapy to terminate the arrhythmia by rapid pacing or by delivering a large shock. The oldest implantable cardiac device, pacemakers have been used to treat slow heart rhythms. More recently, pacing has been used to help the failing heart contract in a more normal fashion (cardiac resynchronization therapy or CRT). Most commonly, devices designed to provide CRT also have ICD capabilities. The last type of implantable cardiac device is an implantable loop recorder (ILR). The ILR is a strictly diagnostic device (it provides no therapy) and is used to evaluate patients with intermittent symptoms that are separated by longer periods of time (weeks and months). A comprehensive discussion of implanted cardiac devices is far beyond the scope of this introductory text on ECGs, but since pacemakers are so common it is important to have some basic understanding on how they function and how they affect the ECG.

Pacemakers were first developed as a way to artificially stimulate the heart in patients with bradycardia. Depending on which chamber(s) needs to be paced lead(s) are placed in the right atrium and/or right ventricle (Figure 12.1). The first pacemakers developed used a single lead placed in the right ventricle. Although ventricular pacing prevents catastrophic bradycardia, atrioventricular synchrony is not maintained. In patients with sinus node dysfunction, atrial pacing is sufficient to treat bradycardia because atrioventricular conduction is normal. Obviously, for a patient with bradycardia due to atrioventricular block, a single chamber atrial pacing would not be effective for producing ventricular depolarization. In the United States dual chamber pacemakers are the most common type

of pacemaker used for treating bradycardia. Although dual chamber pacemakers are more complicated, they ensure ventricular depolarization and maintain atrioventricular synchrony in patients with bradycardia due to either sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular block.

More recently, leads have been placed in veins overlying the left ventricle to restore more normal ventricular depolarization in patients with left bundle branch block and severe heart failure.

## **Figure 12.1:**

Different pacemaker types for the treatment of bradycardia. Single chamber ventricular pacemakers use a single lead placed in the right ventricle. Single chamber ventricular pacemakers prevent bradycardia in both sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular block but do not maintain atrioventricular synchrony (atrial contraction followed by ventricular contraction). Single chamber ventricular pacemakers deliver a stimulus to pace the ventricles after the low rate timer expires. The low rate timer is a programmable parameter that

defines the longest period of time before a pacing stimulus is delivered. Single chamber atrial pacemakers operate in the same way but with the pacing lead in the atrium. Dual chamber pacemaker can be quite complex but for the purposes of this function it is simply important to know that they have an AV interval (AVI) timer that is designed to mimic the physiologic PR interval. In this way dual chamber pacemakers are able to prevent bradycardia and maintain AV synchrony regardless of the cause of bradycardia.

Atrial pacing

## **Figure 12.2:**

Atrial pacing is used for patients with sinus node dysfunction. In this case the sinus node does not depolarize normally so the pacemaker is set to depolarize at a rate of 60 beats per minute. The shape of the P wave gives some idea of the location of the pacing lead. In this case the P wave is negative in aVR and biphasic in lead aVF, which suggests

that the electrodes of the lead are placed in the lower portion of the right atrium. Notice in this example the patient has conduction via the AV node that produces a narrow QRS complex. However, the patient does have evidence for AV node disease because of the presence of a prolonged PR interval and first degree AV block.

# Ventricular pacing

## **Figure 12.3:**

Ventricular pacing prevents bradycardia but does not maintain atrioventricular synchrony. In this case the sinus rate is about the same as the programmed ventricular pacing rate. The first three QRS complexes are due to ventricular pacing from the inferior right ventricular apex (the QRS complexes are wide, negative in the inferior leads, and have a left bundle branch block morphology). The fifth through seventh

QRS complexes are produced from native conduction due to atrial depolarization from the sinus node (upright P wave in lead II with a narrow QRS and a normal PR interval). The fourth QRS complex is due to fusion between normal AV conduction (notice the P wave before the QRS) and ventricular pacing. It has an intermediate shape that has characteristics of both the native QRS complexes and ventricular pacing.

## **Figure 12.4:**

Dual chamber pacing. Top. In this patient P waves are "sensed" by the atrial lead of a dual chamber pacemaker and "tracked." When P waves are "tracked," the P wave initiates the AV interval and a ventricular output is delivered when the AV interval expires. In this way AV synchrony is maintained. Notice in Figure 12.3 with single lead ventricular

pacing, P waves do not occur before the ventricular paced beats. In the bottom strip, both atrial and ventricular pacing is present. This patient has both sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular conduction abnormalities; we know that the PR interval is at least 0.20 seconds because no intrinsic ventricular conduction was observed after the atrial stimulus.

# **Figure 12.5:**

In patients with congestive heart failure and left bundle branch block, cardiac function may be worsened because of poor timing of left ventricular contraction. In left bundle branch block the lateral left ventricular wall contracts very late relative to the septum. In an effort to provide more coordinated left ventricular contraction, specially designed

leads can be placed on the lateral wall of the left ventricle through the coronary sinus and venous branches. Simultaneous pacing from the left ventricle and the right ventricle leads to more coordinated contraction. In this case the QRS is narrower during cardiac resynchronization than during pacing from the right ventricle.
