#### **Abnormal Repolarization: T Wave Changes and the QT Interval**

The ST segment correlates with the plateau phase of the ventricular action potential where all of the ventricular cells are depolarized and the voltages in the inside and outside of the cell are close to the same. However, over time the cell begins to repolarize and the voltage inside of the cell becomes negative compared to the outside. The T wave is produced as the ventricular cells repolarize. Think of the beginning of the T wave as the point where the first cells are repolarizing, the peak of the T wave when the greatest number of ventricular cells are repolarizing and the end of the T wave as the point when the last cells are repolarizing. As described in Chapter 2, repolarization occurs more gradually than depolarization, which leads to a "flatter" and more broad-based T wave. Since depolarization starts in the endocardium and repolarization starts in the epicardium, the normal "T wave follows the QRS complex."

In general, abnormal T waves are classified as either "peaked and prominent" or inverted. Inverted T waves are the most common T wave abnormality observed in clinical medicine. Identification of the cause of abnormal T waves can be extremely problematic because many medical problems can be associated with T wave inversion. Repolarization abnormalities follow a hierarchy of importance: ST segment elevation > ST segment depression > T wave inversion. For this reason, when evaluating ECGs look for ST elevation first, then ST segment depression, and only after isoelectric ST segments have been confirmed should you look for abnormal T waves.

Early repolarization is associated with ST segment elevation and prominent T waves, although in some cases the ST segment changes will be minimal. Peaked T waves can occur in two important abnormal

conditions. First peaked T waves can represent the first signs of injury to the heart and second, peaked T waves are usually described in the context of hyperkalemia. The two conditions can generally be separated electrocardiographically by the extent of the prominent T waves. In myocardial injury the peaked T waves are localized to a specific region supplied by the coronary artery while in hyperkalemia peaking of the T waves is more generalized.

Usually the direction of the QRS complex and the T wave are the same because depolarization and repolarization occur in opposite directions. From a practical standpoint, since ventricular depolarization occurs from right to left which leads to positive QRS complexes in aVL, I, II, and aVF in the frontal plane and V4 through V6 in the precordial plane, the T waves are positive in these leads in the setting of normal depolarization.

In addition to the shape of the T wave, the timing of the T wave relative to the QRS complex should be evaluated by measuring the QT interval. The QT interval is measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave and provides a rough estimate of the duration of ventricular depolarization until the end of repolarization.

A prolonged QT interval can be observed under several conditions (Table 6.1). First, the QT interval can be prolonged because of a hereditary disorder called the Long QT Syndrome. Second, a number of drugs can cause QT interval prolongation (Table 6.2). Third, electrolyte disorders such as hypocalcemia and hypokalemia can cause QT interval prolongation.

# Prominent T waves

## Early repolarization

![](_page_3_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_3_Figure_5.jpeg)

#### **Figure 6.1:**

**Background:** Patients with early repolarization will often have prominent T waves. **ECG:** In early repolarization the prominent T waves will be observed in the inferolateral leads. Early repolarization should be suspected if there is the characteristic "hook" on the terminal portion of the QRS complex. In most cases, ST

segment elevation will be observed in the leads with the most prominent T waves. **Clinical Issues:** Early repolarization is fairly common, and is observed in about 7–12% of the general population. Interestingly, early repolarization may be more common in athletes with a prevalence of 30% in some studies.

# Prominent T waves

## Myocardial Injury

![](_page_5_Figure_4.jpeg)

#### **Figure 6.2:**

**Background:** T wave peaking may be the first sign of myocardial injury on the ECG. Usually isolated T wave peaking is rapidly replaced by ST segment elevation (although the T waves remain prominent). **ECG:** T wave peaking associated with myocardial injury is localized to a region supplied by a specific coronary artery and often, reciprocal ST segment changes are also observed. In the example, prominent T waves are noted in V2 and V3

due to a significant lesion in the left anterior descending coronary artery. In addition, notice the accompanying subtle ST segment depression in the lateral leads (V4−V6 and I) and

the inferior leads (II and aVF).

**Clinical Issues:** The presence of localized T wave peaking is very suggestive of a significant coronary artery lesion and in the patient complaining of chest pain, serial ECGs and aggressive diagnostic evaluation is essential.

# Prominent T waves

## Hyperkalemia

![](_page_7_Figure_4.jpeg)

#### **Figure 6.3:**

**Background:** Generalized T wave peaking is the first sign of hyperkalemia. Peaking usually is observed when the serum K+ is > 5.5 mM. **ECG:** The first ECG sign in hyperkalemia is T waves peaking. If the hyperkalemia worsens (> 6.5 mM) the QRS complex begins to widen and ST segment elevation may be observed (Chapter 4, Figure 4.17). In this example, prominent T waves are noted in V3 through V6 and leads II and I. In addition to the prominent T waves the QRS complex is wide without Q waves due to abnormal depolarization. With careful observation, ST segment elevation in leads V1 and V2 is also present. Finally, atrial tissue is more sensitive to hyperkalemia than ventricular tissue. This difference leads to loss of visible

P wave activity particularly at extremely high K+ levels (> 8 mM). Interestingly the sinus node is still "driving" the heart and this condition is called a "sinoventricular" rhythm. Although it would be unusual for myocardial injury to have this combination of ECG changes, again the clinician must also take the patients symptoms into account. In hyperkalemia, chest pain is usually absent although patients may complain of nausea and generalized weakness. **Clinical Issues:** Emergent treatment of hyperkalemia is reviewed in Chapter 4, Figure 4.17. In general once a blood sample is sent off, glucose and insulin are given. If the ECG changes are due to hyperkalemia, the ECG changes will rapidly improve.

T wave Inversion

Myocardial Ischemia

![](_page_9_Figure_4.jpeg)

#### **Figure 6.4:**

**Background:** Ischemia may also cause T wave inversion.

**ECG:** T wave inversion is a very nonspecific finding particularly in the lateral leads because left ventricular hypertrophy is common. However, T wave inversion in V3 and V4 should arouse suspicion of ischemia in a patient with chest pain and has been associated with disease in the left

anterior descending artery. The T wave inversion is usually symmetric and fairly prominent. **Clinical Issues:** T wave inversion should arouse suspicion for ischemia in the patient with chest pain particularly if it is new when compared to prior ECGs.

## T wave Inversion

# Left ventricular hypertrophy

![](_page_11_Figure_4.jpeg)

#### **Figure 6.5:**

**Background:** Left ventricular hypertrophy can also cause anterior T wave inversion but is generally associated with accompanying lateral wall T wave inversion and ST segment depression. **ECG:** In this example, inverted T waves are present in the entire precordium but notice that asymmetric downsloping ST segment depression is noted in the lateral leads I and aVL. The criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy are reviewed

in detail in Chapter 8, Figures 8.12–14, but in general are characterized by large QRS complexes (due to increased left ventricular mass) and abnormal repolarization with ST depression and T wave inversion. Notice in this example the QRS in aVL is extremely large (approximately 20 mm). **Clinical Issues:** The presence of repolarization abnormalities associated with left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with a worse prognosis in large population studies.

## T wave Inversion

# Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)

![](_page_13_Figure_4.jpeg)

III

#### **Figure 6.6:**

**Background:** Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a hereditary disease that leads to fatty infiltration of the right ventricle and is associated with the development of ventricular arrhythmias. **ECG:** The ECG in ARVC has several characteristic findings. Anterior T wave inversion is present and is often associated with a right bundle branch block pattern (rSR' in V1). In

addition, in some cases discrete sharp "spikes" will be seen in the ST segment of leads V1 and V2. These are called epsilon waves and represent extremely late depolarization of a small part of the right ventricular outflow tract. **Clinical Issues:** Patients with ARVC are at high risk for the development of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.

![](_page_15_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_15_Figure_5.jpeg)

#### **Figure 6.7:**

**Background:** After the T wave, another deflection called the U wave can be observed. **ECG:** The U wave is usually observed in young adults and is most commonly seen as a positive wave after the T wave in leads V2 or V3. The U wave is due to myocardial stretch rather than ventricular repolarization and for this reason most experts do not include the U wave in the measurement of the QT interval. The QT interval can be difficult to measure because the end of the T wave may be difficult to identify.

When calculating the QT interval, the steepest slope of the terminal downstroke or upstroke should be used to draw a "tangent." Where the tangent crosses the baseline should be used as the endpoint of the T wave. The QT interval must be corrected to rate to calculate the QTc (Chapter 3). **Clinical Issues:** Accurate identification of patients with prolonged QT intervals is important because QT interval prolongation is associated with increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.

## "Prolonged" QT

Apparent prolonged QT interval (prolonged PR interval)

![](_page_17_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_17_Figure_5.jpeg)

#### **Figure 6.8:**

**Background:** Sometimes the P wave will be mistaken as the terminal portion of the T wave. **ECG:** In patients with significant disease of their AV node, PR interval prolongation may be observed (first degree AV block). In this example a prolonged PR interval leads to a P wave that occurs just after the T wave (double headed

arrows). This situation can usually be identified by the apparent absence of a P wave in front of the QRS complex. **Clinical Issues:** PR interval prolongation occurs when there is AV node disease that causes slower conduction through the AV node.

![](_page_19_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_19_Figure_5.jpeg)

#### **Figure 6.9:**

**Background:** The Long QT Syndrome is a family of hereditary diseases associated with abnormalities in the ion channels responsible for repolarization. **ECG:** There are many subtle ECG findings associated with the Long QT Syndrome but all are associated with prolongation of the QT interval. Delayed repolarization is often due to abnormal function of ion channels (particularly K+ channels). On ECG the QT is prolonged. In general the QT interval (solid arrow) should be less than half the RR interval

(dashed arrow); in other words, you should be able to fit two QT intervals into one RR interval. The Long QT Syndrome is generally not associated with any QRS changes. **Clinical Issues:** The Long QT Syndrome is associated with increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Prolongation of the action potential appears to reactivate the Na+ and Ca2+ channels used for depolarization and lead to repetitive ventricular depolarization.

![](_page_21_Figure_4.jpeg)

## **Figure 6.10:**

**Background:** A number of drugs can cause QT interval prolongation (Table 6.2). **ECG:** QT interval prolongation due to drugs may be associated with abnormal T waves such as lateral T wave inversion as in this case or may simply be due cause QT interval prolongation. In this case the anti-arrhythmic drug ibutilide led to a temporary increase in the QT interval.

**Clinical Issues:** Any cause of prolonged QT interval (hereditary, drugs, metabolic disorders, etc.) can be associated with the development of ventricular arrhythmias (Chapter 11, Figure 11.28). Anti-arrhythmic medications (particularly those that block K+ channels) are the most common cause of QT interval prolongation.

## Prolonged QT

## Hypokalemia

![](_page_23_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_23_Figure_5.jpeg)

## **Figure 6.11:**

# **Background:** Hypokalemia can cause QT prolongation.

**ECG:** Traditionally QT prolongation due to a large "U wave" has been described as the classic sign for hypokalemia. More recent studies have shown that the "U wave" is actually a "double humped" or bifid T wave. The ECG changes associated with hypokalemia are more likely to be observed

with progressive decreases in K+. When the K+ is between 3.0 and 3.5 mM, ECG changes will be observed in approximately 10% of people, while 80% of people will demonstrate ECG changes once the K+ is < 2.7 mM. **Clinical Issues:** Hypokalemia requires careful replacement of K+.

## Prolonged QT

## Hypocalcemia

![](_page_25_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_25_Figure_5.jpeg)

## **Figure 6.12:**

**Background:** Hypocalcemia can cause QT interval prolongation. **ECG:** The classic ECG change associated with hypocalcemia is prolongation of the ST segment with no change in the shape of the T wave.

**Clinical Issues:** The main treatment is correcting the low serum calcium with careful Ca2+ replacement.

![](_page_27_Figure_1.jpeg)

Prolonged QT Hypomagnesemia

![](_page_27_Figure_3.jpeg)

![](_page_27_Figure_4.jpeg)

## **Figure 6.13:**

**Background:** Hypomagnesemia may be present in a variety of conditions including alchohol abuse and with medications, particularly diuretics. **ECG:** Hypomagnesemia can also cause QT interval prolongation. The three electrolyte disorders have slightly different ECG manifestations. The QT interval prolongation due to hypokalemia is associated with a biphasic T wave. In hypocalcemia, QT interval prolongation is mainly due to ST segment prolongation. No specific ECG manifestations for hypomagnesemia have been described other than

generalized prolongation of all components of the QT interval (ST segment and T wave) although some studies have suggested that hyopomagnesemia is associated with more prominent T waves. It should be noted that many patients will have several metabolic disorders, e.g. both hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, so that specific ECG patterns other than a prolonged QT interval will be difficult to identify. **Clinical Issues:** Generally, the treatment of hypomagnesemia is magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), usually 1–3 grams given intravenously.

# Prolonged QT Subarachnoid hemmorhage

![](_page_29_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_29_Figure_5.jpeg)

## **Figure 6.14:**

**Background:** Subarachnoid hemorrhage can cause QT interval prolongation. **ECG:** In subarachnoid hemorrhage, ECG changes may be observed in up to 80% of patients with QT prolongation with symmetric T wave inversion associated with bradycardia the characteristic finding. The specific mechanism for

these ECG changes is not well understood although increased sympathetic and parasympathetic tone has been suggested. **Clinical Issues:** The QT interval prolongation does not require specific treatment. The presence of ECG abnormalities does not affect prognosis.
