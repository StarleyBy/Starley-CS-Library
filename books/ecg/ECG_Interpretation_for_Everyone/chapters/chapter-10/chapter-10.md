### **Arrhythmias: Bradycardia**

There are only two general causes of slow heart rates: Failure of the sinus node to deliver normal impulses or depolarization is blocked between the atrium and the ventricles (atrioventricular or AV block) (Figure 10.1). Although someone new to clinical medicine might say, "who cares? A slow heart rate is a slow heart rate," it is very important to make this distinction as the management can vary dramatically. The ECG can provide definitive information on the specific site of the problem.

In sinus node dysfunction, since the sinus node does not generate an impulse at the normal rate there are fewer P waves than expected. There are many manifestations of sinus node dysfunction including sinus pauses, sinus bradycardia, ectopic atrial rhythm, or junctional rhythm. In ectopic atrial rhythm and junctional rhythm, the sinus rate is so slow that a subsidiary pacemaker, either from another region in the atrium or the AV node, must take over and "drive" the heart. We introduced ectopic atria rhythms and junctional rhythms in the last chapter. Ectopic atrial rhythms and junctional rhythms can be observed if these sites have more rapid activity than the sinus node or in the case of sinus node dysfunction if the sinus node pacemaker activity slows. These two situations can generally be differentiated by rate, the arbitrary cut-off for an abnormal sinus rate is 50 beats per minute and the AV junction has a spontaneous rate of about 35–50 beats per minute. If junctional rhythm is observed because of more rapid junctional activity the heart rate will be > 50 beats per minute and if junctional rhythm is observed because of sinus node dysfunction, the heart rate will be < 50 beats per minute.

In AV block the site of block is usually in the AV node or in the His bundle since these two structures, in most cases, form the only axis for AV conduction. Clinically AV block is classified by the relationship between the P waves and the QRS complexes. In first degree AV block

(introduced in Chapter 9, Figure 9.6) there is a one to one relationship between the P waves and the QRS complexes but the time required for AV conduction is prolonged (> 0.20 s). First degree AV block does not cause slow heart rates in and of itself since every P wave is conducted to the ventricles. In second degree AV block some but not all P waves are conducted to the ventricles and in third degree heart block there is no relationship between P waves and QRS complexes. It is important to remember that AV block is a normal response in the setting of rapid atrial activity. For example, if the atria were to suddenly start to beat at 300 times a minute (as in atrial flutter, Chapter 11, Figure 11.6), the AV node acts to limit the number of impulses that propagate to the ventricles and prevents rapid ventricular rates. Think of the AV node as a regulator that "protects" the ventricle from atrial arrhythmias. The corollary of this point is that abnormal AV conduction should only be identified if the P waves have a normal rate.

Second degree AV block is further classified into different types depending on the exact relationship between P waves and QRS complexes. In 1924, Woldemar Mobitz classified 2° AV blocks into Type I or Type II. In Type I block there is gradual prolongation of the PR interval until a QRS complex is dropped. Type I block is most commonly called Wenckebach block in honor of Karl Wenckebach who first described this unusual conduction pattern in the late 1800s by carefully evaluating the relationship between the venous and arterial pulsations without the aid of the ECG (pretty impressive). In Type II block the PR interval remains constant and there is a sudden dropped QRS complex. The distinction between Type I and Type II block is very easy to make from the ECG. Simply measure the PR interval before and after the P wave associated with the dropped QRS complex. If the PR intervals are different Type I block is present and if they are the same Type II block is present. The distinction between Type I and Type II block is extremely important. In Type I block, the site of block is usually within the AV node so that if complete AV block develops the patient is usually left with a junctional rhythm with a heart rate of 35–50 bpm. The presence of Type II block suggests that the site of block is "below the AV node" within the His bundle (infranodal block). In this case, if complete AV block develops the patient is dependent on a pacemaker within ventricular tissues for the generation of QRS complexes. These ventricular sites are associated with very slow heart rates and are extremely unreliable and can stop suddenly.

### **Figure 10.1:**

Bradycardia can develop from either failure of the sinus node to initiate depolarization (sinus node dysfunction) or once the atrium is depolarized, atrioventricular block. The two forms of bradycardia can easily be differentiated by the ECG: in sinus node dysfunction not enough P waves are generated, while in AV block there are "enough" P waves, but they do not conduct

to the ventricles in a normal fashion. In the example, since the sinus node is not depolarizing normally, a subsidiary site, the AV node, "takes over" depolarizing the heart. Junctional beats in this case can be identified because the QRS complex is not preceded by a P wave. In the example of AV block, there is no AV conduction, so the AV node region also generates the QRS complexes but

There are two situations that do not "fit" into the Type I and Type II classification system for AV block. In the first, every other P wave is associated with a QRS complex. In 2:1 AV block although the PR intervals are the same before and after the blocked P wave, 2:1 AV block can be due to block within the AV node or infranodal. In most cases of 2:1 block the patient will have a few consecutive P waves that conduct to the ventricles so that the distinction between Type I and Type II can be made. Generally since Type I AV block is much more common than Type II block, intermittent periods with gradual prolongation of the PR interval will be observed between periods of 2:1 AV block. In the second situation called advanced AV block, two or more consecutive nonconducted P waves are present. In this case three or more P waves are presented between QRS complexes but some P waves conduct so that some AV conduction is present.

Although discussed earlier, there are two common circumstances where AV conduction is normal but are classified incorrectly as 2° degree AV block. In the first a premature atrial contraction (PAC) is not associated with a QRS complex (often called a "blocked PAC" in clinical shorthand). The second situation is an abnormal atrial rate associated with block in AV conduction. The AV node has decremental conduction properties so both of these responses are actually normal. In order to make the diagnosis of AV block, the P waves must be regular and with a normal rate.

In complete heart block (3° AV block) there is no relationship between P waves and QRS complexes. If the block is within the AV node a regular narrow QRS rhythm or junctional rhythm will be observed. This can be a source of confusion since junctional rhythm is also a manifestation of sinus node dysfunction. The difference is that in complete heart block P waves are present and do not conduct to the ventricles and in junctional rhythm due to sinus node dysfunction P waves generated by the sinus node will not be seen. If complete heart block due to infranodal block develops, the escape QRS complex will be wide.

unlike sinus node dysfunction P waves at a normal rate are present. (With permission, taken from FM Kusumoto, *ECG Interpretation:*  *From Pathophysiology to Clinical Application*, Springer, New York, NY, 2009.)

The distinction between 2° degree AV block and complete heart block seems confusing at first glance. For example, how do I differentiate between advanced AV block and complete heart block? Actually there is a practical way for the ECG to help. In 2° AV block, generally the QRS rhythm is irregular because of some conducted P waves while in complete AV block the QRS rhythm will be regular. This practical method helps in another situation. In atrial fibrillation, the atria are activated irregularly and in turn this leads to an irregular QRS rhythm. In patients with atrial fibrillation and complete AV block, a *regular* slow QRS rhythm will be observed.

Sinus Node dysfunction (Not enough P waves) Artifact

![](_page_5_Figure_3.jpeg)

## **Figure 10.2:**

Particularly with rhythm strips, artifact (in reference to the ECG, artifact refers to any condition in which an external source or problem causes a change in the ECG recording rather than an actual signal generated by cardiac activity) can lead to apparent asystole. The most common cause of this problem is that one of the leads temporarily loses skin contact. In this case, artifact is confirmed since the sinus rate is

unchanged before and after the apparent pause (the R-R intervals denoted by the double-headed arrows are constant) and a small "partial" signal also be identified. Obviously it is important to determine whether the patient has symptoms during any "arrhythmia" episode. Although absence of symptoms does not "rule out" arrhythmias, in almost all diseases the presence of symptoms is associated with a worse prognosis.

## **Figure 10.3:**

In this case of sinus node dysfunction, the sinus node stops depolarizing so no P waves are observed but the resulting QRS is wide and very slow because the subsidiary AV node pacemaker also did not depolarize normally. Ventricular pacemakers such as in this case are slower and notoriously unreliable (they can stop suddenly) and patients are at higher risk for developing significant symptoms. Compare this to the middle panel of Figure 10.1. In

Figure 10.1, when a sinus pause occurs the AV node "takes over." In this case, a deflection after the QRS complex due to retrograde depolarization of the atria can be observed (arrows). The AV node is a "two-way street" and can conduct both forward and backward. Normally since the sinus node has the fastest pacemaker activity, only forward conduction through the AV node and His bundle is

observed.

![](_page_9_Figure_4.jpeg)

## **Figure 10.4:**

There are many forms of sinus node dysfunction. In this case, instead of a prolonged pause, a single P wave is dropped. This condition is sometimes called sinus node

exit block because it is thought to be due to block of depolarization from the sinus node to surrounding atrial tissue.

![](_page_11_Figure_3.jpeg)

## **Figure 10.5:**

There are several patterns of 2° AV block that have been identified by ECG. In all forms of 2° AV block some but not all P waves conduct to the ventricles to produce a QRS complex. Originally Mobitz described two forms: Type I and Type II. This is an example of Type I AV block (more commonly called Wenckebach block) that is characterized by progressive prolongation of the PR interval (arrows) until

finally there is a dropped QRS (?) due to AV block of atrial depolarization. In any case of AV block it is important to make a clinical guess at the site of block. Block within the AV node while abnormal carries a better prognosis than block within the His bundle. Almost all cases of Mobitz Type I block associated with a narrow QRS complex are due to block in the AV node.

![](_page_13_Figure_4.jpeg)

## **Figure 10.6:**

This is another example of Mobitz Type I block identified by progressive PR interval prolongation before the dropped QRS complex. In this case, the QRS is wide due to right bundle branch block (Chapter7, Figure 7.5). Generally any time

Mobitz Type I block is identified, the site of block is in the AV node, although in this case the presence of accompanying right bundle branch block is evidence that some His Purkinje

disease is present.

## **Figure 10.7:**

In Mobitz Type II block, the PR interval remains constant before a P wave is associated with a dropped QRS complex (?). Mobitz Type II block is important to identify because it is generally due to block in the His bundle region and carries a worse prognosis than block in the AV node (mainly due to the slower and more unreliable ventricular pacemakers that would have to depolarize the heart if complete heart block present, and if the PR intervals are the same, the patient has Type II block.

were to develop). Although most textbooks emphasize evaluating successive PR intervals prior to the P wave with the dropped QRS, it is often easier to simply evaluate the PR interval before and after the P wave without the QRS complex. If the PR intervals are different, Type I block is

## **Figure 10.8:**

It is important to remember that abnormal AV block can generally be identified only when the P wave rate is constant. In this case there are premature atrial contractions (PAC) that do not result in ventricular conduction and a QRS complex because the AV node is refractory. This condition is sometimes misidentified as

abnormal AV block. Remember from Chapter 3 that AV nodal conduction delay is important to allow efficient filling of the ventricles from atrial contraction. In addition, as we will learn in Chapter 11, by acting as a "limiter" the AV node prevents rapid atrial activity from resulting in rapid ventricular conduction.

![](_page_19_Figure_3.jpeg)

## **Figure 10.9:**

This is an example of 2:1 AV block. The P wave rate is regular but every other P wave does not conduct to the ventricles and leads to an absent QRS complex (?). When 2:1 AV block is present it is impossible to classify the AV block as Type I or Type II although generally there will be periods where two

consecutive P waves conduct to the ventricle and the PR interval can be examined for any changes and the PR interval before and after the P wave with the dropped QRS complex can be evaluated.

![](_page_21_Figure_3.jpeg)

# **Figure 10.10:**

In advanced AV block, some conduction from the atrium to the ventricles occurs but several consecutive P waves do not conduct to the ventricles (?). While there is some AV

communication, the presence of consecutive P waves at normal rates that do not conduct provides strong evidence

that AV conduction is tenuous at best.

![](_page_23_Figure_3.jpeg)

# **Figure 10.11:**

In complete heart block, there is no AV conduction and the patient is dependent on an intrinsic pacemaker below the site of block for ventricular depolarization. Complete heart block will be associated with a regular slow rate because no

P waves lead to ventricular depolarization (double-headed arrows). In contrast, in almost all cases of 2° AV block, the rhythm will be irregular due to variable AV conduction.

![](_page_25_Figure_3.jpeg)

# **Figure 10.12:**

In atrial fibrillation, the atria are activated rapidly and chaotically usually leading to rapid and irregular heart rates (Chapter 11, Figure 11.3). In the setting of complete heart

block, the ventricular rate will be regular (double-headed arrows) despite the presence of atrial fibrillation. In the past this was almost always due to digoxin toxicity.

![](_page_27_Figure_3.jpeg)

# **Figure 10.13:**

Using the strict definition of complete heart block (no AV conduction), the QRS complexes will generally be regular. In this example, the fourth P wave conducts leading to one slightly early QRS complex (third QRS). The first, second, and fourth

QRS complexes arise from the junction since they have a r egular slow rate (double-headed arrows). Although this is not a case of complete heart block, clinically this condition would

be treated in exactly the same way as complete heart block.

# **Figure 10.14:**

In the setting of AV block, it is important to evaluate the QRS complexes-both from lower subsidiary pacemakers and for conducted beats. This information is critical for evaluating short-term and long-term prognosis. In this case of advanced 2° AV block (consecutive nonconducted P waves), when atrioventricular conduction does occur sometimes only the right bundle (RB) conducts producing a QRS with a

left bundle branch block morphology (wide negative QS complex) and at other times only the left bundle (LB) conducts producing a QRS with a right bundle branch block morphology. This condition is particularly worrisome and the clinician should be very concerned about the development of P waves without QRS complexes (no heart rate = a bad thing).
