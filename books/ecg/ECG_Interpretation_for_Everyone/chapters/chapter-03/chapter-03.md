## **ECG Interpretation Basics**

Now we come to the art of evaluating the ECG and using it in clinical context. Although computer analysis of the ECG has become far more accurate over the past two decades, the ability to carefully interpret an ECG remains an important skill in clinical medicine. However, although the ECG may be extremely useful, it is important to remember that, at best, the ECG provides supplementary information to a careful history and physical examination.

Traditionally ECG interpretation is taught by sequentially calculating the heart rate, measuring the cardiac axis, measuring cardiac intervals, evaluating the P wave, the QRS complex, the ST segment, and then the T wave. However, in clinical practice we appropriately focus on identifying potential life-threatening problems first. In fact, we believe that, in general, most of clinical training focuses on being able to distinguish "very, very" sick from "not-so" sick. In these emergent and urgent situations the ECG is really useful for 1) evaluating abnormally fast and slow heart rates and 2) identifying myocardial injury.

With this in mind, use the algorithm in Figure 3.1 for your initial analysis of the ECG. First, make an initial assessment of the heart rhythm. Make sure that P waves are present and that every P wave results in a QRS complex, and, most important, that the overall heart rate is between 50 and 110 beats per minute. If these statements are true, then the heart rhythm is not life-threatening (although not necessarily normal). The point here is that any heart rhythm with these characteristics (P waves and QRS complexes with a 1:1 relationship at a normal rate) should be able to provide sufficient blood flow to the lungs, brain, and the rest of the peripheral circulation. Second, the ST segment after the QRS complex should be evaluated. The ST segment should be isoelectric – in other words, the segment separating the T wave and

Evaluation of the ST segment. Use the T–P and PR segment (dotted line) to estimate the level of an isoelectric ST segment. ST segment elevation is an ST segment above this imaginary line, ST segment depression is an ST segment below this line, and an isoelectric ST interval will be level and near this line.

the P wave of the next beat (sometimes called the T–P interval and the period when the ventricle is filling "passively" without atrial contraction), the PR interval, and the ST segment should all be at the same level (Figure 3.2). If the ST segment is elevated or depressed, particularly if the patient is also complaining of chest pain or shortness of breath, myocardial injury may be present. No mystery, no voodoo, and no hocus pocus: probably 90–95% of emergent conditions in which the ECG provides rapid information that requires immediate clinical treatment is addressed by evaluating these two issues. If the rhythm is normal and the ST segments are isoelectric ("Yes and Yes"), interpretation of the ECG can take a more leisurely pace once the patient has been attended to.

It is important to remember that a comprehensive analysis of the ECG can have many components (Figure 3.3). In general, although all of these components fall into three major groups: Evaluation of the rhythm (Chapters 9–11), evaluation of ventricular depolarization (Chapters 7 and 8), and evaluation of ventricular repolarization (Chapters 4–6). The characteristics of a normal ECG are illustrated in Figure 3.4.

### **Figure 3.3:**

Once a life-threatening arrhythmia is ruled out and the presence of isoelectric ST segments is confirmed, the ECG can be evaluated in a systematic fashion. Although there are many components to a comprehensive interpretation of the ECG that are beyond the scope of this introductory text, in general there are three essential parts to ECG analysis. First, the rhythm should be specifically identified. We have already done some "triage" by identifying abnormally slow or fast heart rhythms. Second, ventricular depolarization

should be assessed. ECG findings suggestive of abnormal ventricular depolarization include a wide QRS complex (> 0.12 s), a QRS complex that is positive in lead V1 , abnormal cardiac axis, and the presence of Q waves. Third, ventricular repolarization should be evaluated. Again, the reader has already done some triage by evaluating the ST segment but other abnormalities of ventricular repolarization include abnormal T waves (both inverted and peaked) and delayed ventricular repolarization (prolonged QT interval).

#### The normal ECG

- 1. Rate should be between 50 and 110 bpm
- 2. A P before every QRS (Positive P in lead II)
- 3. The QRS in V1 (MCL 1) should be narrow and negative (rS)
- 4. The ST segment should be isoelectric
- 5. The T wave should be the same direction as the QRS

### **Figure 3.4:**

The characteristics of a normal ECG. First, the P wave is upright in lead II and negative in aVR suggesting that the atria are being depolarized by the sinus node. Every P wave is followed by a QRS complex with a PR interval of < .20 s, these two findings confirm that the AV node is functioning normally. Second, ventricular depolarization is characterized by a narrow QRS complex (< 0.12 seconds), which suggests that the His Purkinje system is functioning normally with simultaneous activation of the right and left ventricles. The cardiac axis is approximately 60° with the

largest positive deflection in the limb leads identified in lead II. The precordial QRS complexes are normal with a predominantly negative QRS complex in lead V1 . A Q wave in lead aVR (and sometimes in III) is expected since ventricular depolarization is traveling away from this lead and small Q waves (< 0.04 ms) due to septal activation can be seen in the l ateral leads, particularly V6 . Repolarization is normal with an isoelectric ST segment and T waves that are in the same general direction as the QRS in that lead. The QT interval is normal and less than half the R–R interval.
