#### **Arrhythmias: Normal Rates and Skips**

Arrhythmias are classified by their rate (Figure 9.1). Abnormally slow heart rhythms are called bradycardias from the Greek root "brady," which means slow. Chapter 10 provides a comprehensive discussion of bradycardia. Abnormally fast hearts are called tachycardias from the Greek root "tachy," which means "fast" and are covered in Chapter 11 (good luck when you come to this chapter, this is the most complicated of the arrhythmia topics). In between these two extremes are a diverse collection of arrhythmias with normal heart rates that will be the subject of this chapter.

We discussed normal rhythm in Chapter 3, Figure 3.4. In a normal rhythm the sinus node is generating the cardiac impulse and initiating atrial depolarization and every atrial depolarization is followed by a timely ventricular depolarization. The source of atrial depolarization is identified by examining the shape of the P wave. Since the sinus node is located at the superior *vena cava*/right atrial junction, it is positive in lead II and negative in aVR. If the AV node and His bundle are conducting normally, ventricular depolarization (a QRS complex) will follow the P wave. With normal conduction through the AV node and His bundle, the PR interval (the interval measured from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex) will be < 0.20 s.

If the patient is having an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) at a normal rate there are two basic questions that must be answered. First, is the basic rhythm being generated by the sinus node? Second, are there irregular heart beats?

#### **Figure 9.2:**

We often shorten "normal sinus rhythm with normal AV conduction" to "normal sinus rhythm." Obviously the sinus node could still be generating depolarization but if atrioventricular conduction was blocked every P wave would not be associated with a QRS (this cause of bradycardia is covered in Chapter 10). So we should always remember that when we say a patient has "normal sinus rhythm," we are really saying two things: the sinus node is generating the beat and

atrioventricular conduction is normal. In this example the P waves are negative in aVR and positive in lead II. The PR interval is 0.20 s, which is the upper limit of normal. It is hoped that after reading the first portion of the book you would have noted the inverted T wave in lead III that could still be a normal finding since there are no accompanying T wave changes or QRS abnormalities in the other inferior

leads.

Sometimes electrical signals from other electrical equipment will interfere with the ECG recording. In this case low amplitude from an implanted muscle stimulator is interfering

with the ECG but a P wave can be observed (\*). This patient has a normal heart rhythm.

#### **Figure 9.4:**

In an ectopic atrial rhythm, a site other than the sinus node depolarizes the atrium. In ectopic atrial rhythm the P wave will not be positive in lead II and negative in aVR\*. The shape of the P wave will be dependent on the site of the ectopic atrial focus. In this example the ectopic atrial rhythm is being generated from a site in the lower part of the atria

since the P waves are negative in the inferior leads (atrial depolarization must be travelling away from these leads). Since the P wave is positive in aVL and flat or partially negative in aVR, the ectopic site is also probably within the right atrium. Generally ectopic atrial rhythm is of no clinical

consequence.

### Regular Rhythm

### Junctional Rhythm

#### **Figure 9.5:**

Generally, the sinus node has the fastest pacemaker rate of all of the cardiac tissues and "drives" cardiac activity. However, in some cases the AV nodal area can depolarize faster than the sinus node and a junctional rhythm will be observed. In junctional rhythm, since the AV node is

generating the heart beat, there is no P wave before the QRS complex. Junctional rhythm generally has no clinical consequence but a slow junctional rhythm (Chapter 10 on bradycardia) may be a sign of sinus node dysfunction.

Regular rhythm Sinus rhythm with first degree AV block

#### **Figure 9.6:**

In this example, the inverted P wave in aVR and positive P wave in II is evidence that the sinus node is responsible for atrial depolarization (\*). However, the PR interval is abnormally prolonged (0.36 s). Any PR interval > 0.20 s is classified as first degree AV block. In this case there is "normal" sinus rhythm (the P waves are being generated at a normal rate) but atrioventricular conduction is not "normal." Oftentimes, new ECG readers look for a P wave in front of every QRS as their definition of "normal sinus rhythm." As illustrated in

(arrows).

this example, evaluating the relationship between P waves and QRS complexes is a measure of AV node and His Purkinje function. Finally, this ECG illustrates an important advantage to digital ECG recording in which signals are acquired simultaneously. If a P wave is easily identified in one lead (II and aVF), the leads above and below can be evaluated and more subtle deflections that represent P waves can be identified

#### **Figure 9.7:**

The most common cause of an irregular heart rate in young adults is normal irregular depolarization of the sinus node. The rate of sinus node depolarization changes as metabolic need changes. When we exercise the sinus rate increases because of more sympathetic nerve (the "adrenalin" system)

activity. In young people the sinus rate will change fairly dramatically simply with normal breathing. In sinus arrhythmia all of the P waves (\*) have the same shape but the interval between P waves varies.

## Premature atrial contractions

#### **Figure 9.8:**

Another common cause of an irregular heartbeat is a premature atrial contraction. Another site within the atria, other than the sinus node, depolarizes early. This leads to an early P wave that often can be found in the preceding T wave (circled areas). Since the ventricles are still activated

normally by the His Purkinje system the QRS complex comes early but has a normal shape similar to the QRS complexes produced by the sinus beats. Premature atrial contractions generally have no clinical consequence but in some people can initiate atrial fibrillation (Chapter 11, Figure 11.4).

# Premature junctional contractions

![](_page_16_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_16_Figure_5.jpeg)

#### **Figure 9.9:**

Another cause of an early beat is premature depolarization from the AV nodal area. In this case the early QRS complex will be the same as the sinus rhythm QRS complexes but there will be no early P wave before the early QRS complex. Sometimes the premature junctional beat will lead to both ventricular contraction and atrial contraction. In this case the atria are depolarized abnormally from "low to high" so the P wave is inverted. This backwards depolarization is usually called retrograde conduction. If retrograde conduction is very fast the P wave might be observed just before the QRS complex (extremely rare), if retrograde conduction and ventricular depolarization are similar the smaller P wave will

be obscured by the QRS complex (most common), and if retrograde conduction is slower than ventricular depolarization the inverted P wave will be seen in the ST segment. Again, comparing the QRS, ST segment and T wave for both the normal beat and the early beat is extremely useful. In this case the early beat has a negative deflection in the ST segment that is not seen in the normal beat (circles). This "unexpected" deflection must be a P wave and confirms that the early beat arose from the AV node. Premature junctional complexes have very little clinical consequence other than being an ECG oddity.

# Premature ventricular contractions

![](_page_18_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_18_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 9.10:**

Sometimes early activity arises from ventricular tissue to produce a premature ventricular complex. Since premature ventricular complexes do not use the normal His Purkinje system for ventricular depolarization, the QRS complex is wide and bizarre, appearing often with an initial upstroke or downstroke that is less steep (arrow). Retrograde atrial contraction can sometimes be seen after the QRS complex (vertical arrows) but may be very subtle. Premature

ventricular contractions may be a marker for increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias but may also be benign and of no clinical consequence. A general rule (a "glass bead" rather than a pearl) is that premature ventricular contractions are "bad" if they are associated with the presence of other structural heart disease (reduced heart function, etc.) and "Not much to worry about" if the patient has no other heart

abnormalities.

# Premature atrial contractions (with aberrant conduction)

![](_page_20_Figure_4.jpeg)

![](_page_20_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Figure 9.11:**

Not all early QRS wide QRS complexes are from premature ventricular contractions. Another cause of an early wide QRS complex is a premature atrial contraction that is associated with aberrant or abnormal conduction. In this case, as the depolarization from the premature atrial contraction reaches the His Purkinje system, one of the bundle branches (usually the right bundle branch) is refractory (cannot conduct) and the wave of depolarization

only travels down one of the bundles. Bundle branch block leads to sequential activation of the ventricles and a wide QRS complex. Identification of a premature atrial contraction with aberrant conduction requires identification of the early atrial depolarization. As reviewed in Figure 9.8, careful comparison of the T waves for the beat before the early beat and a later regular beat will help (circles).

Irregular Rhythm Competing pacemakers

![](_page_22_Figure_4.jpeg)

### **Figure 9.12:**

Sometimes irregular heart rhythms can be seen when different sites within the atria have similar rates or irregular and "compete." In this example, a site from the lower atrium is faster than the sinus node and produces a P wave that is inverted in the inferior leads (Pe) and an ectopic atrial rhythm. When this "pacemaker" pauses, the sinus node takes over and produces a normal upright P wave (Psr) and a short run of sinus rhythm. However, the lower atrial site

begins to depolarize again at a rate faster than the sinus node and gradually takes over. Notice that there is one P wave (Pf) that is a "fusion" beat where atrial depolarization is due to both the ectopic site and the sinus node and the P wave has an intermediate morphology between the P wave from the ectopic atrial rhythm and the P wave produced by the sinus node.

Irregular Rhythm Atrial fibrillation

![](_page_24_Figure_3.jpeg)

![](_page_24_Figure_4.jpeg)

### **Figure 9.13:**

Another cause of an irregular rhythm with a relatively normal heart rate is atrial fibrillation. In atrial fibrillation, the atria are activated continuously by multiple atrial waves of depolarization. Atrial fibrillation is generally associated with a rapid ventricular rate because rapid atrial activation leads to rapid ventricular rates but in some cases, if the AV node

does not conduct rapidly, atrial fibrillation can be associated with relatively normal rates although the rhythm will be irregular. Atrial fibrillation is covered extensively in Chapter 11, Figures 11.3, 11.4, and 11.7 and of all the arrhythmias it is the most prevalent and associated with the most hospital admissions.
