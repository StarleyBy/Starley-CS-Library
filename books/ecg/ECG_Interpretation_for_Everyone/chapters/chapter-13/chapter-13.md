#### **Clinical Use of the ECG: Stress Testing**

Since identifying myocardial ischemia or injury is one of the most useful functions of the ECG in patients with chest pain, it is not surprising that the ECG is used as a diagnostic tool during exercise stress testing to identify patients who may have significant coronary artery lesions. The concept is simple, exercise increases metabolic demand of cardiac tissue. If blood supply is limited to a region of the heart because of significant blockages that region will become ischemic and the ECG will show signs suggestive or diagnostic of ischemia. Exercise stress testing is generally a safe procedure. However, severe complications such as myocardial infarction and death have been reported in approximately 1 / 2,500 tests. Obviously, good clinical judgment and appropriate risk stratification should be considered before ordering or performing any type of stress test.

There are several protocols used for exercise testing but all employ a gradual increase in the slope and speed of a treadmill. The Bruce Protocol is the most widely used exercise protocol. It delivers an incremental workload every three minutes. This protocol is used for patients that are able to exercise and achieve at least a speed of 2.5 to 3.4 mph on an incline of 12% to 14%. For individuals where this amount of exercise is unrealistic, several protocols that use lower workloads such as the modified Bruce Protocol, the Balke Protocol, and the Naughton Protocol have been developed. Regardless of the protocol, in general patients are asked to exercise until they have to stop due to symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or generalized fatigue (symptom limited stress test). For most protocols it is important for the patient to achieve a specific heart rate, usually 85% of the maximum predicted heart rate for age.

During exercise, the ECG is constantly monitored with six leads in the standard precordial positions and the limb leads placed on the trunk. The ST segment is the principal parameter monitored during an exercise test. Specially designed ECG recording systems are used that employ specialized electronics to filter extraneous noise and motion artifact from movement and also continuously measure ST segment changes from baseline.

The most common abnormal ECG finding with stress testing is ST segment depression. In order to provide some standardization for interpretation of ST segment changes, the J point (the point where the QRS ends and the ST segment starts) and the J + 80 ms (2 little boxes after the J point) are used as the specific locations of the ST segment for measurement. In addition the character of the ST segment changes are described qualitatively. There are four types of ST segment depression that can occur during cardiac stress testing:

Rapid upsloping: If the ST segment returns to normal at 0.08 sec from the J point, it is a normal response.

Slowly upsloping: The ST segment returns to baseline later than 0.08 sec after the J point and it is an equivocal ST segment response to ischemia (some patients have CAD and some do not). If it only occurs in recovery, it may be entirely normal.

Flat (horizontal) depressed ST segment: It is definitely abnormal and if it upslopes within two to four minutes in recovery, it is much less likely to be true disease.

Downsloping ST segment depression: The possibility of a positive ECG increase with the amount of downsloping and its persistence in recovery.

Several ECG findings are particularly significant if they occur during stress testing because they may signify the presence of significant lesions in multiple coronary arteries (multivessel disease):

Marked ST segment depression greater than 2 mm, especially flat or downsloping ST segment depression.

Early ST segment depression in the first three to five minutes of the test, especially when it is persistent for four to six minutes in recovery.

Severe or increasing chest pain, especially with ST segment depression.

Failure to complete at least four to six minutes of exercise.

Exercise induced hypotension.

Frequent ventricular ectopy in association with ST segment depression.

In addition to ST segment changes, the amount of exercise that an individual can perform on a stress test is extremely useful. Exercise capacity is generally quantified with METS (metabolic equivalents). A MET is a metabolic equivalent that is used to quantify cardiovascular workload and it is used to express exercise capacity. One MET is equal to the uptake of 3.5 ml of oxygen/kg/min and is the average oxygen requirement from inspired air necessary to maintain life in the resting state. After adjusting for age and other risk factors, each increase in exercise capacity (METS) equates to 10% to 25% improvement in survival. Examples of the value of the METS achieved during exercise:

- 5 METS is associated with a poor prognosis in patients under 65 years.
- Failure to complete stage II (7 METS) is very concerning.
- 8.5 METS is common with a sedentary adult.
- 9 METS or more after a CABG indicates a good prognosis regardless of other responses.
- 10 METS is considered a degree of fitness.
- 14 METS is considered physically fit.
- 18–20 METS is considered to be a highly conditioned individual.
- 24 METS is considered a well-trained aerobic athlete.

The probability for ischemia and the likelihood of its severity is directly related to the amount of abnormal ST segment depression and inversely related to the slop of the ST segment. The severity of CAD is also related to the time of appearance of ischemic shifts. It is extremely difficult to evaluate ST segment changes in patients who have significant baseline ST segment abnormalities including left bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, the Wolff Parkinson White Syndrome, ventricular pacing, and digoxin therapy.

Patients will sometimes have ECG changes simply with changes in position. In this patient standing is associated

with attenuation of T waves (\*) and R waves (arrows) in the inferolateral leads.

### **Figure 13.2:**

ECG changes during a normal stress test. With exercise there is minimal upsloping ST segment depression that would not meet diagnostic criteria for ischemia. An ECG obtained immediately upon stopping exercise, shows no ST segment depression. This first ECG during recovery is critical. As noted the ECG during exercise can have

significant artifact due to motion. ST segment depression associated with true myocardial ischemia is relatively long lasting and should remain in the first ECG during recovery. In this case there are no ST segment changes that meet criteria for ischemia. This stress test would be classified as

normal.

All commercially available machines used for stress testing will provide a summary of results. The format of the summary will vary from hospital to hospital. In this case, two summary sheets from the patient in Figure 13.2 are shown. **Top:** In this example, the first summary sheet shows exercise time, conditions (speed and grade), achieved workload in METS, hemodynamic measurements – HR: heart rate, BP: blood pressure; RRP: rate pressure product (heart rate multiplied by the peak systolic blood pressure at a given point in the study); and ST: segment changes. **Bottom:** Representative ECG recordings at critical times for all 12 leads are shown. Absolute values for J point change

and the relative change of the j+ 80 ms point for each lead are calculated by the computer from stored digital tracings and displayed. In this example ST segment depression > 1 mm is noted for leads II, III, V3–V5. Compare the computer generated tracings and estimated values of ST segment depression to the actual tracings at peak exercise and immediately after exercising in Figure 13.2. The waveforms generated by the treadmill machine through its filtering algorithms have overestimated the ST depression that was actually present. This illustrates an extremely important fact. Although the computer ECG generated summaries are useful, evaluation of the actual ECG tracings is always required.

### **Figure 13.4:**

A true positive ECG test. In this example, as the patient exercises, horizontal ST segment depression is noted during exercise. The nurse stops the test because of the magnitude of the ST segment depression (> −2 mm in II and aVF) even in the absence of chest pain. The patient stops exercising and after 2:30 in recovery the patient develops chest pain with horizontal ST segment depression in the inferolateral leads. Within 15 seconds, ST segment depression deepens and becomes downsloping. ST segment depression that is

symptoms increase the likelihood that the ECG changes are due to myocardial ischemia. It is important to note that the development of chest pain is often a relatively late event and that ST segment changes associated with ischemia are usually quite prolonged. In the bottom panel even after the pain has resolved, downsloping ST segment depression persists, particularly in lead II.

# **Figure 13.5:**

Unfortunately ST segment depression that meets criteria for ischemia can also be seen in patients without significant coronary artery disease. This is called a "false positive" because the test was "positive" (in other words, indicates ischemia) but "false" (because it was wrong). False positive ST segment depression is particularly common in women and some have questioned whether the ECG provides any value for identifying ischemia in women. To increase the ability of the stress test to identify ischemia (decrease "false negative" tests) and to reduce the likelihood that the test will incorrectly identify a patient without significant coronary artery disease (decrease "false positive" tests), additional imaging tests such as echocardiography, nuclear scanning,

magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography are used. Patients with true flow limiting lesions will have changes in function or blood supply that can be identified by these advanced imaging techniques. In this example, prominent upsloping ST segment depression is observed in II and horizontal ST depression noted in the other inferior leads III and aVF. The patient had no associated symptoms and an accompanying echocardiogram demonstrated no abnormalities in left ventricular function. This test emphasizes the importance of symptoms for deciding whether any ECG changes are due to ischemia (rather than the other way around). This is why the importance of symptoms has been stressed throughout this book.

# **Figure 13.6:**

Another situation where the ST segment depression can be observed as a false positive is in the Wolff Parkinson White Syndrome. Abnormal ventricular depolarization can lead to abnormal repolarization with stress tests. In this example the patient has a short PR interval and a widely negative QRS

complex in lead V1 consistent with a right sided accessory pathway. The ST segment depression is an expected finding with stress and the ECG essentially provides no information on the presence of coronary artery lesions.

The development of ST segment elevation during stress testing is extremely suggestive of multivessel disease. ST

In addition to ST segment changes, the development of ventricular arrhythmias with exercise may identify patients at higher risk of future sudden death. In this example, during exercise, horizontal ST segment depression in aVF and ST
