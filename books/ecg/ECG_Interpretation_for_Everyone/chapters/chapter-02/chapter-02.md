# **The Normal ECG**

Before we can discuss the normal ECG, a quick review of the anatomy and the function of the heart is essential to provide a framework for our discussion. Unoxygenated blood from the body returns to the heart via the large superior and inferior *vena cavae*. Blood from these large veins enters into the right atrium and if the tricuspid valve is open the right atrium is a large passive "passage way." Atrial contraction causes a final surge of blood to fill the right ventricle and as the ventricles contract the tricuspid valve closes and the pulmonic valve opens and blood is expelled from the heart and is pumped to the lungs (Figure 2.1). Once oxygenated by the lungs the blood returns to the heart via the left atrium, and in a process similar to the right, blood flows fills the left ventricle both passively and actively when the left atrium contracts. When the left ventricle contracts, the mitral valve closes and the aortic valve opens and blood is expelled from the heart to the body. This process seems extremely complex but is actually fairly simple if we think about cardiac activity from two different vantage points. From the perspective of a single blood cell, blood travels sequentially through the *vena cavae*, right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary arteries to the lungs. Once oxygenated the blood cell travels through the pulmonary veins back to the left atrium, left ventricle, and finally is propelled into the aorta. From the perspective of heart cells, there is near simultaneous activation of the right and left atria and after a slight delay almost simultaneous activation of the right and left ventricles. This sequential pumping process is controlled by electrical signals generated by the heart that can be measured by the ECG.

### **Normal electrical activity of the heart**

#### **Atrial depolarization**

Certain specialized cells exhibit spontaneous depolarization and are called "pacemaker" cells. Although cells in the AV node, His Purkinje system, and sometimes atrial and ventricular tissue exhibit spontaneous activity, since the rate of spontaneous depolarization is highest in a region called the sinus node, the sinus node generally serves as the principal pacemaker of the heart.

The sinus node is a small spindle shaped structure located at the junction of the superior *vena cava* and the right atrium. The sinus node has spontaneous pacemaker activity between 60–100 beats per minute. The sinus node receives nerve input from both the sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic system and this is why the heart rate varies. With exercise, increased sympathetic input leads to an increase in the rate of spontaneous pacemaker activity that in turn will lead to faster depolarization of the atria and ventricles (and faster heart rates when you measure the peripheral pulse). At night, increased parasympathetic input leads to a slowing of the pacemaker rate. Sometimes this dynamic interplay can be observed during breathing. As a general rule, with slow inspiration the heart rate slows (check your own pulse) and with expiration the heart rate increases (particularly if you do not immediately take another breath). Although it initiates electrical activation, the sinus node is so small that the current it generates cannot be seen on the surface ECG (Figure 2.2).

## **Figure 2.1:**

Basic diagram of blood circulation in the body. Deoxygenated blood returns to the heart from the body via the inferior and superior *vena cavae*. Blood enters the right atrium and sequential right atrial and right ventricular contraction pumps blood to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries. Blood is oxygenated in the lung and returns to the left atrium via the pul monary veins. Sequential contraction of the left atrium and left ventricle pumps the oxygenated blood into the aorta. Blood is then distributed to the body and the cycle repeats. (Illustration by David Factor.)

The pacemaker activity produced by the sinus node is propagated through the atria, and since the sinus node is located "high and to the right," the right atrium is activated before the left atrium and the general direction of atrial depolarization is "high to low" and "right to left." Depolarization of the atrial tissue leads to release of Ca2<sup>+</sup> ions from the *sarcoplasmic recticulum* in the cells of the atrium that in turn causes the heart cells to contract. On a larger scale, contraction of all of the atrial cells leads to contraction of the atrial chamber and provides the final filling of the right ventricle. It should be apparent that this is a fairly complex process and that there is a small but measurable delay between atrial depolarization and actual movement of blood (1. atrial cell is excited; 2. Ca2<sup>+</sup> ions are released; 3. atrial cells (chambers) contract; and 4. blood moves). Electrical activity generated by atrial depolarization produces the P wave on the ECG.

Although depolarization of the sinus node cannot be seen on the ECG, evidence that the sinus node is generating the electrical impulse can be obtained by inspecting the shape of the P wave. If the sinus node is "driving" the heart, the P wave is negative in aVR and positive in lead II ("high to low" and "right to left"). Generally right atrial and left atrial depolarization proceed in the same direction so that in a given lead the P wave is positive or negative. Relook at Figure 1.6 from Chapter 1, and notice that the small P wave is generally either all negative (lead aVR) or predominantly positive (the rest of the leads). The common exception is lead V1 (Figure 2.3). In this case, right atrial depolarization travels "toward" V1 leading to an initial positive deflection, but sometimes a later negative deflection can be observed because of left atrial depolarization. In fact if you refer to Chapter 8, Figure 8.14 on left ventricular hypertrophy, you will see that a large negative deflection in lead V1 is an important indicator of left atrial enlargement.

Right and left atrial depolarization is usually complete within 0.10 seconds so the normal P wave is 2–3 little boxes wide. The atria have a

very small mass compared to the ventricles so the normal P wave is usually less than 2.5 mm (two and a half little boxes) tall. Atrial repolarization generates voltages so small it is not seen on the ECG.

#### **Atrioventricular conduction**

(*AV node, His bundle, bundle branches, and Purkinje system*)

Once the atria are depolarized and the atria contract, blood is pumped into the right and left ventricles. As has been mentioned, the speed of electrical activity is much faster than the speed of blood, so to better improve the timing of atrial and ventricular *contraction*, the electrical impulse of atrial depolarization encounters the AV node where the conduction velocity is slowed. At this point, the atria are completely depolarized and the ventricles are about to be depolarized. Since there is no electrical activity that can be measured by the ECG (the electrical impulse traveling through the very small AV node cannot be measured from the body surface), an isoelectric period can be observed on the ECG (Figure 2.2). The duration of the isoelectric period will depend at least in part on the speed of the electrical impulse through the AV node. For example, if the electrical impulse is abnormally slow through the AV node, a long isoelectric period will be observed.

After slow depolarization of the AV node, the velocity of activation speeds up as the impulse travels through the His Purkinje system. The His Purkinje has several components (His bundle, right and left bundles, Purkinje tissue) but all have similar electrical properties and are able to rapidly conduct electrical impulses. The electrical impulse first travels through the common bundle or bundle of His (named for its discoverer Wilhelm His) and divides into a large left bundle that activates the left ventricle and a thinner right bundle that activates the right ventricle. The left bundle further divides into two major components: the left anterior fascicle and the left posterior fascicle. The terminal portions of these branching bundles and fascicles are a network of Purkinje tissues that spread out as a net in the interior surface of both the right and left ventricles. Although the His Purkinje system allows rapid conduction and is extensive, its overall mass is relatively small so activation of these tissues cannot be observed on the surface ECG. In fact, abnormalities of components of these systems are deduced because different portions of the ventricle are activated abnormally. In general, the normal His Purkinje system allows the electrical impulse to be "delivered" to large portions of the ventricle at nearly the same time so that right and left ventricular depolarization can start simultaneously and blood can be efficiently and forcefully expelled from the heart. If the His Purkinje system were not present or functioned abnormally some regions would contract before others and blood would not be pumped as efficiently.

### **Ventricular depolarization**

Ventricular depolarization leads to a large deflection called the QRS complex. Ventricular depolarization has historically been called the QRS because it is made up of multiple components that are called Q waves, R waves, and S waves. Since describing the shape and the components of ventricular depolarization is very important, a common "language" for describing the QRS complex has been developed and is important to learn. Although the nomenclature can seem daunting, arbitrary, and confusing at first, it is actually easily learned and applied. The first negative deflection is called a Q wave, the first positive deflection an R wave, and any negative deflection after the R wave is called an S wave. Capital letters are used for large deflections and lower case letters for smaller deflections. In general larger deflections are produced because of larger mass or a more uniform direction of depolarization. If the ventricles are depolarized in several directions, the sum of their voltage as measured by the ECG will be smaller due to canceling out of activity. The decision on

whether to use a capital letter or a lower case letter is often made by the clinician. A completely positive deflection is called an R wave and a completely negative complex is called a QS complex. Additional positive and negative deflections are described using a prime symbol: r' or s' depending on whether an additional positive or negative deflection is observed. Figure 2.4 shows some common complexes and their descriptors.

Normally the left ventricle has a larger mass than the right ventricle, so that even though the right and left ventricles are activated simultaneously the shape of the QRS complex is dominated by the left ventricle. For this reason, the general direction of ventricular depolarization in the frontal plane recorded by the limb leads is right to left and "high to low" (Figure 2.5).

![](_page_8_Picture_2.jpeg)

# **Figure 2.5:**

The general direction of cardiac activation in the frontal plane is called the cardiac axis. The largest positive deflection will be recorded in the lead that is oriented most directly in the path of ventricular depolarization (in this case, lead II). (Adapted with permission from FM Kusumoto, *Cardiovascular Pathophysiology*, Hayes Barton Press, Raleigh, NC, 2004.)

The cardiac axis is used to more precisely calculate the direction of ventricular depolarization. The value of the axis is given in degrees using the lead alignment shown in Figures 1.3 and 1.4 in Chapter 1. A normal cardiac axis can have a wide range between −35° and 110° but is usually about 60°. The easiest way to calculate the cardiac axis is to remember that the ECG lead that is "looking" most directly at the wave of depolarization will have the largest positive deflection with smaller positive deflections recorded as the recording lead "looks" at the wave of depolarization from larger and larger angles. When the lead is perpendicular to the wave of depolarization a biphasic signal that is first positive and then negative is recorded (Figure 2.6). For most people, the

![](_page_9_Figure_2.jpeg)

### **Figure 2.6:**

The shape of the QRS complex will depend on the relationship between the wave of cardiac depolarization and the orientation of the lead. If the lead is directly in front of the depolarization wave a large positive signal will be recorded. As leads are oriented away from the wave of depolarization, the size of the positive wave will decrease and a terminal negative wave will be recorded as the wave of depolarization is traveling away from the lead. When a lead is perpendicular to the depolarization wave an equally biphasic wave will be recorded. When the wave of depolarization is directed away from the lead a negative deflection will be recorded.

largest QRS complex is observed in lead II and a completely negative QRS complex is often recorded in aVR (Figure 1.6 in Chapter 1).

If the axis is abnormally shifted to the right > 110° the largest positive wave will be recorded in lead III and if the axis is shifted to the left the largest R wave will be in aVL. Traditionally large sections of texts have been devoted to calculating the exact value of the QRS axis. Although useful for making sure someone knows the basis of ECGs, from a clinical standpoint estimating the general direction of ventricular depolarization is all that is required. The general direction of ventricular depolarization can be calculated by at least three different methods:

Find the lead with the largest QRS, and the mean electrical activation travels in the direction of the lead. If 2 leads are about the same height, the axis will be between these 2 leads.

Find the most isoelectric lead (most biphasic) and the largest QRS should be perpendicular to this lead. The lead with the largest QRS represents the general direction of the axis. Each limb lead has a corresponding perpendicular limb lead to form a pair: lead I and lead aVF; lead II and lead aVL; lead III and lead aVR.

The mean QRS axis can be calculated by the limb leads I and aVF. Keep in mind the four quadrants that are divided by 90 degrees.

- If lead I is positive and lead aVF is positive, the axis is normal because it falls between −30 to +110, which is the normal axis (normal quadrant).
- If lead I is positive, lead aVF is negative, and lead II is also negative, it falls between −30 and −90 which is left axis deviation (left quadrant).
- If lead I is negative and lead aVF is positive, this is a right axis deviation (right quadrant).
- If lead I is negative and lead aVF is negative, then this is extreme right axis deviation (northwest quadrant (using our compass analogy in the last chapter) or "no man's land").

Of these three methods, simply looking for the limb lead with the largest R wave is generally sufficient and the easiest method to remember. Although the QRS axis can be abnormal due to abnormalities of the heart, it is also important to remember that the cardiac axis reflects the

### **Figure 2.7:**

In the horizontal plane, the precordial leads generally record two components of ventricular depolarization. First septal activation proceeds from left to tight and then a larger right to left wave of depolarization is observed since the left ventricle has much more mass than the right ventricle. This second component of ventricular activation is usually much larger than septal activation simply on the basis of mass (mass of the septum is small relative to the rest of the left ventricle).

position of the heart relative to the body so will also be affected by conditions that change the position of the heart within the thorax. For example, in chronic obstructive lung disease the heart may hang more vertically in the chest and this leads to a more rightward axis even in the absence of any abnormalities of the heart itself.

The shape of the QRS complex in the precordial leads can also vary with the relative orientation of the ventricles in the chest cavity. Generally the QRS complex in lead V1 has an rS morphology. Initial septal activation occurs from left to right (because the left bundle branches off "first" compared to the right bundle) and since the left ventricle is usually positioned behind the right ventricle a large negative deflection is observed (Figure 2.7). In lead V6 , the QRS complex will often have a small q wave due to "left−to−right" septal activation followed by a large R wave due to left ventricular activation. Often the term R wave progression is used to describe the relative sizes of the R waves in the precordial leads. In lead V1 and lead V2 small r waves are present because they represent septal activation, but the R wave becomes larger laterally as it now represents left ventricular depolarization. The precordial leads where the R wave and S wave are approximately equal is called the transitional zone and usually occurs between leads V2 and V4 , with lead V3 being the most common site.

As has been mentioned, the His Purkinje system is important for allowing simultaneous left ventricular and right ventricular activation. This phenomenon can be seen in the ECG, despite the ventricle being significantly larger than the atria and thus the QRS has a larger amplitude than the P wave, the duration of the P wave and the QRS complex are normally fairly similar – generally a little less than three little boxes or ≤ 0.12 seconds.

#### **ST segment**

Once depolarized, the ventricles continue to contract for about 0.4 to 0.45 seconds to allow blood to be expelled from the heart to the lungs or body. During this period, the ventricular cells are in their plateau phase (they remain depolarized) so there are usually no electrical gradients that can be measured by the ECG so that after the QRS complex there is an isoelectric period often called the ST segment. As we will see later, changes in the ST segment are important for identifying myocardial injury and ischemia.

### **Ventricular repolarization**

As ventricular contraction is completed, the ventricles begin to repolarize and return to their baseline state to prepare for another depolarization/contraction sequence. Ventricular repolarization produces the T wave. Ventricular repolarization is much more heterogeneous when compared to ventricular depolarization (which is mediated by the His Purkinje system) and this leads to a T wave that is more broad based and generally of lower amplitude (think "squashed") when compared to the QRS complex. It is an interesting paradox that the normal T wave generally is in "the same direction" as the direction of the QRS complex because depolarization proceeds from endocardium to epicardium ("inside−out") and repolarization proceeds in the opposite direction from epicardium to endocardium ("outside−in") (Figure 2.8). Part of the basis for this apparent

![](_page_13_Picture_1.jpeg)

#### **Figure 2.8:**

Depolarization (*Top*) and repolarization (*Bottom*) of the ventricles as observed in the frontal plane. Depolarization occurs almost simultaneously because of the His Purkinje system. Depolarization occurs from endocardium to epicardium and since the left ventricle has a larger mass than the right ventricle the overall direction of depolarization is from right to left and from the superior portion of the ventricles to the lower portion of the ventricles. In general this leads to an axis of approximately 60° so that a large R wave is noted in lead II, an RS complex is observed in aVL (depolarization travels toward and then away from this lead), and a QS complex is noted in lead aVR. Depolarization occurs from epicardium to endocardium in a more gradual fashion. This leads paradox is that the epicardial cells have a shorter action potential duration than endocardial cells.

### **Timing of normal cardiac activity**

In the first section of this chapter we focused on the shape of the various waveforms but one of the important uses for the ECG is measuring the timing relationship of different cardiac events.

#### **Heart rate (R**−**R interval)**

The most basic timing measurement of the ECG is the heart rate. Since the pulse is generated by ventricular contraction, the distance between two QRS complexes (the R−R interval) will provide an estimate of the heart rate. Remember that each large box represents 0.20 seconds so slower heart rates will be associated with larger distances between QRS complexes. For example if the heart rate is 60 beats per minute, QRS complexes will occur once every second and the QRS complexes will be separated by 5 large boxes at the standard paper speed. If the heart rate is 100 beats per minute only 3 large boxes or 0.60 seconds will separate each QRS complex. One can do the math and calculate the exact heart rate by using the formula:

Heart rate (beats per minute) = 60 / (the R−R interval in seconds)

This formula is accurate but can be rather cumbersome (and hard to remember) in clinical medicine. Since the importance of determining the exact heart rate is rarely clinically important, it is much easier to estimate the rate by the following formula (Figure 2.9):

Heart rate (beats per minute) = 300 / (the number of large boxes between two QRS complexes)

#### **Figure 2.8:** (*Cont'd*)

to an upright T wave in II, a flat (slightly inverted in this example) in lead aVL, and an inverted T wave in aVR. Notice that since repolarization is generally in the opposite direction than depolarization, the QRS and T wave orientation is usually the same.

![](_page_15_Figure_2.jpeg)

### **Figure 2.9:**

Calculation of rate and common intervals. In this case the QRS complexes are separated by 4 large boxes (R–R interval) so the rate is approximately 75 bpm (300/4). The PR interval is measured from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex. The QRS interval is measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the QRS complex. The QT interval is measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. In general the QT is normal if it less than half the R–R interval ("You can fit two QTs into one R–R"). (Reproduced with permission from FM Kusumoto, *ECG Interpre tation: From Patho physiology to Clinical Appli cation*, Springer, New York, NY, 2009.)

So that if the QRS complexes are separated by two large boxes the heart rate is 150 bpm, three large boxes yields a heart rate of 100 bpm, four large boxes 75 bpm, and five large boxes 60 bpm. Finally, another very simple way to estimate the rate is to remember that at a standard paper speed of 25 mm/s most 12 lead ECGs record 10 seconds of cardiac activity. Simply count the number of beats and multiply by 6.

In most cases the rate of atrial activity will be the same as the rate calculated from ventricular depolarization (R−R interval) since the sinus node is normally the "driver" of the heart and the AV node/bundles conduct every atrial impulse to the ventricles. In some cases the atrial rate will be slower than the ventricular rate either due to more rapid ventricular depolarization or slower atrial activity due to abnormalities in sinus node function. In both of these conditions there will be more QRS

complexes than P waves. Conversely, sometimes the atrial rate will be more rapid than the ventricular rate because atrioventricular conduction does not maintain a 1:1 relationship between atrial depolarization and ventricular depolarization (more P waves than QRS complexes).

#### **PR interval**

The PR interval is measured from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex (Figure 2.2). The PR interval provides an estimate of atrioventricular conduction and represents right atrial depolarization (remember AV node conduction usually begins near the end of right atrial depolarization and at the same time left atrial depolarization begins since the AV node is located in the interatrial septum between the right and left atria), AV node depolarization, and His Purkinje depolarization. The normal PR interval gets longer with age, but for adults is ≤ 0.20 seconds and is most commonly about 0.16 s (4 little boxes).

# **QRS interval**

The QRS interval is measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the QRS complex and provides a rough estimate of the time required for depolarization between the first portions of the ventricle to be activated to the last portion of the ventricle to be depolarized. The normal QRS interval is ≤ 0.12 seconds (3 little boxes). Generally, the posterior portion of the left ventricle closest to the spine is the last ventricular site to depolarize although this can change if there is blocked conduction in either the left or right bundle. In fact, the hallmark for identifying block in one of the bundles is a widened QRS interval > 0.12 seconds (Chapter 7, Figures 7.1 and 7.2; Chapter 8, Figures 8.1 and 8.2).

#### **QT interval**

The last commonly measured interval is the QT interval. The QT interval is measured from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. The end of the T wave can sometimes be difficult to measure because the T wave has a much more gradual upslope and downslope but drawing a tangent line along the steepest part of the descending portion of the T wave has been advocated and accepted as the best way to measure the QT interval (Figure 2.10). Most commonly the QT interval is measured in lead II although recent guidelines recommend using the lead with the longest QT interval (usually lead V2 or V3 ). Measurement of the QT interval in leads V2 and V3 can be sometimes be more difficult to measure because of a U wave. A U wave is a very low amplitude signal that is probably due to rapid filling of the ventricles rather than another wave of repolarization. It is usually seen as a positive wave in leads V2 and V3 and is more commonly seen with slower heart rates. Although there has been some disagreement in the past, since the U wave does not appear to be due to ventricular repolarization most now agree that it should not be included in the measurement of the QT interval. The QT interval measures the time between the first ventricular cell to depolarize and the last ventricular cell to repolarize, and provides a rough estimate of the duration of the plateau phase of ventricular tissue. As described in Chapter 6, Figures 6.7–6.14, the QT interval is prolonged in patients with electrolyte disorders, certain medications, and may be congenitally long due to abnormalities of K<sup>+</sup> channels. The QT interval is longer in women and decreases with rate. For this reason the QT interval is usually corrected to rate by an algorithm and called the QTc where "c" stands for "corrected." The most common method for correcting the QT interval for rate is the Bazett's formula:

QTc = QT (seconds) / (R−R)1/2

Where "R−R" is the R−R interval in seconds. Several other techniques for rate correction have been suggested but the Bazett's correction is the most commonly used and the one provided by most automated ECG algorithms. A QTc > 450 s in men or > 460 s in women have been used as cut−off values for dividing normal and abnormal values but it should be remembered that in reality the QTc can vary from many causes and there is significant overlap in QTc intervals between patients with known genetic disorders that cause QTc prolongation and the normal population. An easy way to "get a feel" on whether the QT interval is prolonged is to remember that in general the QT interval should be less than half the R−R interval. Given the obvious difficulty in measuring the QT interval it is not surprising that even cardiologists, who are physicians that specialize in heart diseases, often incorrectly measure the QT interval.
